HONOURABLE Dr. JUSTICE B.SIVA SANKARA RAO           

CRIMINAL PETITION (S.R.) Nos.22371, 22956, 23270, 23432    
AND 23568  OF 2015   

COMMON ORDER:      
        
      All these five matters listed for hearing on the office note
for orders as to maintainability of quash petition under Section
482 Cr.P.C in an application filed under the Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (for short the Act) that was
taken cognizance to the file and numbered and the learned
Magistrate issued summons consequently, by impugning the   
same. 
      Perused the office objection.
      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners in the
respective criminal petitions and the learned Public Prosecutors
of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States at length with reference
to the relevant provisions and propositions and perused the
material on record..
      As per Section (2)(i) of the Act, Magistrate means the
Judicial Magistrate of the first class, or as the case may be, the
Metropolitan Magistrate, exercising jurisdiction under the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) in the area where the
aggrieved person resides temporarily or otherwise or the
respondent resides or the domestic violence is alleged to have
taken place;
      As per Section 2(m) of the Act, prescribed means
prescribed by rules made under this Act;
      As per Section 2(q) of the Act, respondent means any
adult male person who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship
with the aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved
person has sought any relief under this Act: Provided that an
aggrieved wife or female living in a relationship in the nature of
a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the
husband or the male partner;
      The reliefs and procedure for obtaining orders or reliefs
provided in Chapter-IV of the Act, of which Sections 12 to 29 are
relevant. Before going to that, the Chapter-V miscellaneous
relating to protection officers, penalty for breach of protection
order by respondent and its cognizance  defined in Section 32 are
as follows:
Chapter-V-Section 32:
Cognizance and proof.  
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), the offence under sub-section (1) of
section 31 shall be cognizable and non-bailable.
(2) Upon the sole testimony of the aggrieved person, the court
may conclude that an offence under sub-section (1) of section 31
has been committed by the accused.  
        Among which Section 32(i) referred supra speaks of the
offence provided by Section 31 is a cognizable and
non-bailable offence, notwithstanding anything contained in the
Cr.P.C. (which mean including Schedule-II as Schedule-I deals
with I.P.C. offences and Schedule II covered the offences under
any other enactments). It is to say, Section 32 is worded with
non-obstante  clause. To understand the emphasis, before going
to the scope of Sections 26 to 29 of the Act, it is essential to
read Sections 4(2) and 5 of Cr.P.C. and also Section 190 Cr.P.C.
Section 190 Cr.P.C. speaks of cognizance of offence by the
Magistrate in three ways, viz., upon receiving a complaint of
facts, upon a police report or upon information received from
any person other than a police officer or upon his own
knowledge.  
      Cognizance is not defined in the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Victim is defined in 2(w)(a). Cognizance to mean
application of judicial mind to the facts on hand.  It is to say
even taking on file of  a case as can be seen from wording of
Section 190 Cr.P.C. supra is taking of cognizance of the offence
or the case as it may be of other matter covered by the Code.
     Now coming to Sections 4 and 5 of Cr.P.C., Section 4(1)
deals with offences under Indian Penal Code whereas Section
4(2) deals with other offences. Section 4(2) reads that all
offences under any other law shall be investigated, enquired
into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same
provisions(of the Code), but subject to any enactment for the
time being in force regulating the matter or place of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with
such offence.  Section 5 speaks  Saving clause that nothing
contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific
provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the
time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power
conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any
other law for the time being in force. It is to say from the
combined reading of Section 4(ii) r/w Sections 5 of Cr.P.C. and
32(i) of the Act, the offence defined in Section 31 is cognizable
and non-bailable irrespective of what is contained in Cr.P.C.
from the non-obstante clause that is saved and for other areas
Cr.P.C. applies. In addition to that, the same is confirmed by
the wording of Section 26 of the Act which reads that (1) any
relief available under sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be
sought in any legal proceeding, before a civil court, family court
or a criminal court, affecting the aggrieved person against the
respondent, whether such proceeding was initiated before or
after the commencement of this Act. (2) Any relief referred to
in sub-section (1) may be sought for in addition to and along
with any other relief that the aggrieved person may seek in such
suit or legal proceeding before a civil or criminal court. (3) In
case any relief has been obtained by the aggrieved person in any
proceedings other than a proceeding under this Act, she shall be
bound to inform the Magistrate of the grant of such relief. It is
to say Domestic Violence Act provisions are available but not the
only forum for the aggrieved to chose, as even instead of
coming to criminal Court by invoking doors of the provisions of
this Act can invoke other provisions, Procedural Law with any
other substantive law and also can invoke substantial civil
remedy by invoking Code of Civil Procedure. Further, even there
is no specific provision under the Act for interim relief in appeal
including in Section 29 of the Act, once Cr.P.C. applies for any
interim relief Section 389 Cr.P.C. can be invoked by virtue of
Sections 26 and 28 of the Act r/w Sections 4 and 5 of Cr.P.C. It
is the sum and substance of Section 26 of the Act. The
expression in Shabe Oza v. M.Oza , there is no finding or
observation and no reference made to Sections 26 to 29 of the
Act.  it is also held that even a statute not provided for interim
relief specifically, general provisions of law can be invoked.
Hence, that contention also no legs to stand.
        Section 27 of the Act deals with jurisdiction in continuation
of Section 2(i) which defines Magistrate of the area is having
jurisdiction. Section 28 is the procedure which says save as
otherwise provided in this Act, all proceedings under Sections
12, 18 to 23 and offences under Section 31 shall be governed by
provisions of the Cr.P.C. Nothing in sub-section (i) shall prevent
the Court for adopting its own procedure for disposal of an
application Under Section (2) Section 23(2) of the Act. It is clear
from the wording of Section 28(i) that Section 31 is a penal
sections defined as offence and Sections 12, 18 to 23 are
defined as proceedings.  It is to say Sections 126 to 128
procedure also equally apply to Domestic Violence Act reliefs if
there is no special provision or special procedure or specific rule
made there under. The law is very clear on this aspect of
several constitutional Courts expressions.
        No doubt, as per Section 6 of Cr.P.C. r/w Section 26 and
Section 2(i) of the Act, High Court is also a criminal Court from
the wording that; besides the High Court, other criminal Courts
of five kinds are defined.  Section 482 is an inherent power which
inheres on the very constitution of the High Court that is saved
but for to say if there is any other specific provision either under
the Code or any other law, Section 482 cannot be invoked as a
matter of course, nor can be exercised by the Court by invoking
it on its own as a matter of routine.  It is an inherent provision to
meet the exceptional contingencies as defined in Section 482
Cr.P.C. of three kinds viz., to implement the orders of any Court
or to prevent any abuse of process and or to meet the ends of
justice.
      From this background coming to Section 29 of the Act
providing an appeal provision which reads that there shall lie an
appeal to the Court of Session within thirty days from the date on
which the order made by the Magistrate is served on the
aggrieved person or the respondent, as the case may be,
whichever is latter. The wording of Section 29 of is the order.
        Learned counsel for the petitioners in submitting about
maintainability made an attempt to say referring to the
expression of the Kerala High Court in Sulochana v. Kuttappan
that what Section 29 wording of the order from the use of
definite article the as per English Grammer is one of the orders
provided in the preceding sections.  Undisputedly, the same is
very clear.  However, if one reads Section 28 which is a
preceding section to Section 29 along with Section 26 of the Act
for reliefs of proceedings under Sections 12, 18 to 23 and
offences under Section 31 are governed by the Cr.P.C. It is
specifically to say cognizance even not defined in the Cr.P.C.,
taking of cognizance is provided under Section 190 Cr.P.C. for
any proceedings to mean like in numbering of the maintenance
case under Section 125 Cr.P.C. There also, the requirement of
application of judicial mind.  Once that judicial mind application
is there, it is taking of cognisance. It is only after taking of
cognizance the numbering of the application arises and it is a
post numbering stage and post cognizance stage issuing of
summons arise.  
        Undisputedly, in all the cases after service of summons,
the quash proceedings are filed. It is to say at the post
cognizance stage. 
      Now the crux is whether an appeal lies against taking of
cognizance referred supra.
        Undisputedly, more than three expressions of different
Single Benches of this Court held, if not also by referring to
Section 29 and also referring clause (f) of State of Haryana v.
Ch.Bhajan Lal , that there is a statutory and substantial, besides
efficacious remedy available under Section 29 of the Act.
Thereby quash proceedings are not automatically sustainable. It
is important to note from one of the guidelines in Bhajan Lal
(supra) that where there is a specific provision in the Code or the
concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for grievance of the
aggrieved party, quash proceedings are not maintainable under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. to invoke. From this proposition, needless to
say, the expression relied upon of  M/S. Pepsi Foods Ltd. & Anr
vs Special Judicial Magistrate & Ors , it was held that an
accused can approach the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 
or Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India. Learned
counsel for the petitioners by placing reliance on it want to
impress the Court that when the constitutional remedies
available under Articles 226, 227 of the Constitution of India or
Section 482 Cr.P.C.  equally irrespective of Section 29 of appeal
remedy though statutory and efficacious, Section 482 Cr.P.C.
proceedings are maintainable. In fact that expression is by giving
approval to the expression and the guidelines of
Bhajan Lal (supra) and not even explaining much less dissenting
to the guidelines. Undisputedly, guidelines of Bhajan Lal (supra)
still rules the field as law of land under Article 141 of the
Constitution of India.
        Learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on the
expressions of this Court in P.Sugunamma v. State of A.P. ,
Markapuram Siva Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh  and Aijaz Ali
Qureshi v. State of Andhra Pradesh . Undisputedly, in all the
three expressions Section 29 of the Act is not referred much less
Sections 26, 28 and 29 r/w Section 2(i) of the Act or Section 190
and Sections 4 and 5 of Cr.P.C. No doubt, in one of the
expressions of this Court in Kesari Kumar v. State of Telangana
in Crl.P.No.7289 of 2014 dated 16.02.2015 the Court almost came 
to the conclusion that in view of the other remedies available
under law, the quash petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C., are not
automatically be invoked. In fact for this conclusion referred the
expressions of the Apex Court including Ashish Dixit v. State of
Uttar Pradesh and Inderjit Singh Grewal v. State of Punjab;
wherein  Section 29 of the Act not referred while quashing
proceedings on the grounds therein in the factual matrix with
conclusion of an abuse of process.
        Now coming back to Sections 26, 28 and 29 of the Act,
even referring to Sulochana v. Kuttappan (supra) the very
expression says in para-12 that I have no hesitation to agree
that the expression 'the order' must take within its sweep all
orders under Sections 18 to 23 and I find no reason to exclude,
going by language and semantics; an order passed under Section 
23 from the sweep of the expression 'the order' in Section 29. It
is to say even from that expression as order used in Section 29 is
not an exclusive but an inclusive expression.  It is with reference
to it, even one reads Section 28, it speaks that all are
proceedings under sections 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 and one
reads the same with Section 190 Cr.P.C.; numbering the same is 
by applying judicial mind and that tantamounts to taking of
cognizance. This also for the reason Section 28 is preceded by
Section 29. In this regard cloud is cleared by the expression of
the Apex Court way back in Dharangadhra Chemical Works v.   
Dharangadhra Municipality  particularly referring to expression
in Kutner v.Phillips,[1891] 2  Q.B. 267 at 272. Zaverbai Amaidas
v.  The State of Bombay [1955] 1 S.C.R. 799, that not only in two
legislations to prevail the subsequent one; even in one legislation
among the provision in the order if any inconsistency or
irreconcilability, the latter provision prevails over the earlier
provision. Once such is the case, though reading of Section 29 it
also to be read Section 28(1) of all proceedings with reference to
Section 26 of the procedure provided in the criminal procedure
code with reference to Section 190 Cr.P.C. to say even the taking
of cognizance is also within the sweep of the order as can be
seen the expression of the Kerala High Court relied upon by one
of the learned counsel. Once such is the case, even taking of
cognizance and numbering of D.V.C. is within the meaning of
the order used in Section 29 of the Act and against which once
there is an efficacious appeal remedy under Section 29 of the Act
and from Bhajan Lal (supra) guidelines it is very clear that once
there is an alternative and efficacious remedy, but for that, the
proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. are not sustainable.
Hence, the office objection holds good thereby all the
applications are liable to be rejected.
        Having regard to the above, while upholding the office
object and at request of learned for the petitioners, the
un-numbered  petitions are disposed of with the following terms:
        Needless to say if any appeal is filed by any of the
petitioners herein, they can file for the period beyond one month
with application invoking Section 14 of the Limitation Act before
the learned Sessions Judge to entertain as it is of bonafide
prosecution in this Court instead of proceeding by appeal before
the Court of Sessions, within the sweep of Section 14 of the
Limitation Act. Further, if any application is filed under Rule 37
of Criminal Rules of Practice or under Section 126(2) or Section
205 to represent through special vakalat or through advocate or
for one to represent others as the case may be, the learned
Magistrate shall entertain, hear and pass appropriate orders
granting the same with necessary conditions.
      Accordingly, these criminal petitions(S.R.) are disposed of.
        Miscellaneous petitions pending if any, shall stand closed.

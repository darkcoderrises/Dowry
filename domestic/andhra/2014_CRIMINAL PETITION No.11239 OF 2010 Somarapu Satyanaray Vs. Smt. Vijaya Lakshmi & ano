THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE T.SUNIL CHOWDARY          
CRIMINAL PETITION No.11239 of 2010    

ORDER:  
1       This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the
proceedings against the petitioner in DVC No.149 of 2010 on the
file of IV Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad.
2       The facts enumerated for filing of the present petition,
succinctly, are as follows:
3       The first respondent herein filed a complaint under Section
12 of The Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005  
(for short the Act) on the file of IV Metropolitan Magistrate,
Hyderabad against the petitioner claiming reliefs under Sections
14, 16 to 20 and 22 of the Act.  The trial Court, after taking the
case on file, issued summons to the petitioner.
4       As per the allegations made in the complaint, the petitioner
and first respondent lived together in house bearing D.No.21-4-82
14th Industrial Area, Gowthami Nagar, Ramagundam for two or 
three years.  The first respondent used to stay in the house of the
petitioner as and when his wife went to her parents house for a
period of two or three months.  The gist of the complaint is that
first respondent is an aggrieved person; therefore, she is entitled to
claim reliefs under sections 18 to 22 of the Act from the petitioner.
5       There is no representation on behalf of the first respondent.
The first and foremost contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is that non-claiming of notice by the first respondent
would amount to service of notice.
6       A perusal of the record reveals that on 12.11.2010, the
learned counsel for the petitioner was permitted to take out
personal notice to the first respondent and file proof of service.  In
pursuance of the said direction, the learned counsel for the
petitioner has taken out personal notice to the address of the first
respondent by registered post with acknowledgement due, but the
same was returned with an endorsement not claimed.  The
learned counsel for the petitioner filed a memo along with return
postal cover in the registry to that effect. For better understanding,
the address furnished by the first respondent in her complaint and
the address to which the petitioner sent notice are furnished in the
following table:
Address mentioned by the first
respondent in her complaint
Address to which the petitioner
sent notice by post
Smt. Somarapu Vijaya Laxmi, W/o   
Somarapu Satyanarayana, Aged:   
50 years, Occ: House wife,
R/o 8-3-228/1337, 1st Floor,
Rahamathnagar, Yousufguda,   
Hyderabad. 

Vijaya Laxmi, D/o Rapalle Babu,
H.No.8-3-228/1337, First Floor,
Rahamath Nagar, Yousufguda,   
Hyderabad. 

7       From the above table, it is clear that notice was sent to the
correct address of the first respondent, as mentioned in the
complaint.
8       As per the principle enunciated in K.Sajjan Raj v Gopi
Setty Chandra Mouli  when a notice has been sent to the correct
address of the party and when the same has been returned as not
claimed, the same amounts to service of notice.
9       In C.C.Alavi Haji v Palapetty Muhammed  the Honble
Supreme Court observed as under: 
        Section 27 of General Clauses Act gives rise to a presumption
that service of notice has been effected when it is sent to the correct
address by registered post.  In view of the said presumption, when
stating that a notice has been sent by a registered post to the address of
the drawer, it is unnecessary to further aver in the complaint that in
spite of the return of the notice unserved, it is deemed to have been
served or that the addressee is deemed to have knowledge of the notice.
Unless and until the contrary is proved by the addressee, service of
notice is deemed to have been effected at the time at which the letter
would have been delivered in the ordinary course of business.  This
Court has already held that when a notice is sent by registered post and
is returned with a postal endorsement refused or not available in the
house or house locked or shop closed or addressee not in station,
due service has to be presumed.
10      The facts of the case on hand are almost similar to the facts
of the case cited supra. In the light of the settled legal position and
having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of
the view that notice is duly served on the first respondent.  Since
the first respondent is not inclined to appear, even after duly
served with notice in this petition, the matter can be decided on
merits.
11      The next contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner
is that the first respondent is not an aggrieved person; therefore,
the DVC filed by her is not maintainable. The learned counsel for
the petitioner would further submit that even if the allegations
made in the complaint are ex facie taken to be true and correct,
prima facie, no case has been made out so as to attract the
provisions of the Act.
12      The Parliament, with a laudable object i.e. in order to provide
for more effective protection of the rights of women, guaranteed
under the Constitution, who are victims of violence of any kind
occurring within the family and for matters connected there with
or incidental thereto, enacted the DVC Act, 2005.
13      Before adverting to the factual aspects of the case, it is
profitable to extract the relevant provisions of the Act.
        Section 2 (a) of the Act defines aggrieved person which
reads as under:
                Aggrieved person means any woman who is, or has been, in a 
domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have been
subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent.
        Section 2 (f) of the Act defines domestic relationship which
reads as under:
                Domestic relationship means a relationship between two persons
who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a shared household,
when they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship
in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as
a joint family.
        Section 2 (q) of the Act defines respondent which reads as
under:
                respondent means any adult male person who is, or has been, in
a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person and against whom the
aggrieved person has sought any relief under this Act:
                PROVIDED THAT an aggrieved wife or female living in a
relationship in the nature of a marriage may also file a complaint against a
relative of the husband or the male partner.
        Section 2 (s) of the Act defines shared household which
reads as under:
(s)     shared household means a household where the person  
aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either
singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether
owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent,
or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the
aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right,
title, interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong to
the joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether
the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the
shared household." 
        Section 26 of the DVC Act, 2005 reads as under:
        26. Relief in other suits and legal proceedings:-
(1)     Any relief available under Secs. 18, 19 20, 21 and 22 may also be
sought in any legal proceeding, before a Civil Court, Family Court or a
Criminal Court, affecting the aggrieved person and the respondent whether
such proceeding was initiated before or after the commencement of this Act.
(2)     Any relief referred to ion sub-section (1) may be sought for in
addition to and along with any other relief that the aggrieved person may
seek in such suit or legal proceeding before a Civil or Criminal Court.
(3)     In case any relief has been obtained by the aggrieved person in any
proceedings other than a proceeding under this Act, she shall be bound to
inform the Magistrate of the grant of such relief.
14      A perusal of Section 26 of the Act at a glimpse connotes that
DVC Act is only a supplementary but not a substitute to the
existing enactments.  The reliefs provided under the Act are not
alternative but in addition to and along with any other relief that
the aggrieved person may seek in a suit or other legal proceeding.
This itself indicates that the very object of the Act is to provide
remedial measures. 
15      A fascicular reading of Section 2 (a) and proviso to Section 2
(q) of the Act clearly demonstrates that not only a legally wedded
wife but also a female, who prima facie establishes her relation
with the respondent is in the nature of marriage, can knock the
doors of the Court seeking reliefs provided under the Act.  The
word aggrieved person encompasses in it legally wedded wife as
well as a female who satisfies the basic ingredients of the Act.  It
appears that the intention of the legislature is to wipe off the tears
of a woman, who is victim of domestic violence and who
parenthetically has not undergone the requisite ceremonies of a
valid marriage of personal laws.  From a conjoint reading of various
definitions, as enumerated in Section 2 of the Act, it is clearly
manifest that this Act recognized the de-facto marriage to rescue
the victims of domestic violence by providing various reliefs.
Establishment of a relationship in the nature of marriage is sine
qua non for granting reliefs under the Act.   A combined reading of
clauses (f) and (s) of Section 2 of the Act postulates that mere
staying in a shared house by itself would not entitle a female to
press into service the provisions of the Act, without satisfying the
other relevant aspects.  The word domestic relation as used in
clauses (a), (f) and (s) of Section 2 of the Act means a relation
between two individuals of heterogeneous sex, which is invariably
in the nature of marriage only.  A reading of one of the definitions
referred supra, in isolation of the other, would lead to
misinterpretation of the provisions of the Act.  In order to
understand the basic concept and underlying object of the Act, one
has to read all these definitions together.   Section 3 of the Act
defines multi facets of domestic violence.  Sections 18 to 22 of the
Act provide remedial reliefs to the victims of domestic violence.
Violation of the orders passed by the Court would attract penal
provisions as contemplated under Section 31 of the Act.
16      During the Vedic period, the institution of marriage was
recognized as a sacrament but not as a contract so far as Hindus
are concerned.  The very purpose of marriage among Hindus is to
perpetuate their family name by procreating children and also
leading the life by meticulously following the religious customs.
The concept of marriage is union of two hearts as one, but not
union of two individuals of opposite sex.  Let mutual fidelity
continue until death is the bedrock for institution of the marriage.
Belief and faith in the above said philosophy made the institution
of marriage intact for centuries so far as India is concerned.
Polygamy was recognized and accepted among Hindus up to 1955    
so far as man is concerned.   The Hindu Marriage Act 1955
introduced monogamy among Hindus.  The changes that have    
taken place in the society are being reflected in the laws made by
the legislature having competency.  Taking note of the
contemporary socio economic conditions of the society, the laws
made by the legislature may be remedial as well as preventive in
nature.  Parliament enacted the Domestic Violence Act with dual
object of remedial as well as preventive.
17      Hindu Marriage Act does not define marriage.  However,
Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with conditions for a
valid Hindu marriage, which reads as under:
                A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the 
following conditions are fulfilled, namely:
(i)     Neither party has a spouse living at the time of the
                     marriage;
(ii)    At the time of the marriage, neither party
(a)     is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of  
                unsoundness of mind; or 
(b)     Though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering    
                from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as     
                to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or
(c)     Has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity,

(iii)   The bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years        
                and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of the     
                marriage;
(iv)    The parties are not within the degrees of prohibited            
                relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of       
                them permits of a marriage between the two;
(v)     The parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the          
                custom or usage governing each of them permits of a             
                marriage between the two;
18      Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act postulates the
ceremonies to be observed during the performance of the marriage.
A conjoint reading of Section 5 and 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act,
1955 clearly indicates what constitutes a valid Marriage under
Hindu Law. 
19      It appears that the words relationship in the nature of
marriage might have been used in the Domestic Violence Act
keeping in mind the scope of Section 5 of Hindu Marriage Act as
well as other personal laws.
20      The crucial question that falls for consideration, at this
juncture, is whether the first respondent herein has satisfied the
basic ingredients of the Act so as to maintain the case in the
backdrop of the various provisions referred supra.
21      Reverting to the facts of the case on hand, the marriage of
the first respondent was performed with one T. Chandramouli in
the year 1980, who is an employee in Singareni Collieries, through
whom she was blessed with two daughters.   As per the allegations
made in the complaint, first respondent developed acquaintance
with the petitioner in the year 1988 during the elections to
Ramagundam Municipal Corporation.  The acquaintance between    
the petitioner and the first respondent has transmogrified into
intimacy during the course of time. The intimacy between the
petitioner and the first respondent culminated into live in
relationship.  Resultantly, the live in relationship between them led
to taking of customary divorce by the first respondent from her
husband on 24.5.2002.   There is no doubt that in the State of
Andhra Pradesh and State of Telangana customary divorce has  
been in vogue in certain communities.   Prevailing of customary
divorce in the caste to which first respondent belongs and the
same was recognized by Court of law is conspicuously silent in the
complaint.  A perusal of the record reveals that the first respondent
filed O.P.No.4 of 2009 against her husband under Section 13 of the
Hindu Marriage Act on the file of the Senior Civil Judge, Peddapalli
seeking to dissolve the marriage between them by granting divorce.
It is an admitted fact that the said O.P. was allowed by granting
divorce and the marriage of the first respondent with her husband
was dissolved with effect from 10.11.2009.   In view of the
judgment and decree in O.P.No.4 of 2009, the oral plea of the first
respondent that she had taken customary divorce from her
husband in the year 2002 is not sustainable either on facts or on
law.
22      As per the allegations made in the complaint, the first
respondent and the petitioner lived together in a house bearing
D.No.21-4-82, 14th Industrial Area, Gowtham Nagar,
Ramagundam, Karimanagar District for a period of two to three
years after she obtained alleged customary divorce from her
husband.  It is further alleged that the petitioner married the first
respondent on 25.11.2008 at Hyderabad.  It is further alleged that
the first respondent and the petitioner used to attend functions
and social gatherings like wife and husband.  But there is no
specific averment from which date to which date they lived together
continuously for a period of two years.  It is also not specifically
mentioned about the time and exact place where the petitioner
married the first respondent. Even assuming but not conceding
that the petitioner and the first respondent lived together under
the same roof, does it automatically entitle the first respondent to
knock the doors of the Court by invoking the provisions of the
Domestic Violence Act is a crucial point to be addressed by the
Court. Even assuming but not conceding that the petitioner and
the first respondent stayed for two or three years under the same
roof that would not confer any right on the first respondent to
invoke the provisions of the Act without establishing the
relationship between them is in the nature of marriage.
23      It is not in dispute that the petitioner and the first
respondent are Hindus by birth and are governed by Hindu law.
For better appreciation of the contentions of the first respondent, it
is not out of place to extract hereunder the relevant portion of the
complaint, which reads as under:
                The wife of the respondent namely Smt. Bharathi used to
go to take care of her parents for a period of 2 to 3 months and
during those timings the petitioner aggrieved person used to live with
the respondent.  It is submitted even in the presence of Smt.
Bharathi the petitioner aggrieved person used to stay in the shared
house in the above house.
24      It is the admitted case of the first respondent that one Smt.
Bharathi is legally wedded wife of the petitioner herein.  The
contents of the complaint would clearly go to show that the first
respondent is very much aware that the petitioner was a married
person.  The first respondent is entitled to contact second marriage
after 10.11.2009 only in view of judgment and decree passed in
O.P.No.4 of 2009.  In order to constitute a valid marriage under
Hindu law, the parties to the marriage have to satisfy the
conditions stipulated under Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
A married woman marrying another married man during the  
subsistence of their marital tie with their respective spouses is not
valid one.  Like wise, a divorced woman is not entitled to marry a
man whose marital tie is in subsistence.  Whether the words
relationship in the nature of marriage as contemplated under
Section 2(f) and proviso to Section 2(q) of the Act encompasses in it
all sorts of live in relationship or not?  The various provisions of
the Act expressly or by necessary implication exclude each and
every live in relationship from the purview of the Act.   At this point
of time the learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn my
attention to the ratio laid down in D.Velusamy Vs. D.Patchaiammal
wherein the Honble apex Court held as under:
31.     In our opinion a `relationship in the nature of marriage' is akin to
a common law marriage. Common law marriages require that although not  
being formally married:-
(a) The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
(b) They must be of legal age to marry.
(c) They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including
being unmarried. (underlining mine)
(d) They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the
world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time. (see `Common
Law Marriage' in Wikipedia on Google) In our opinion a `relationship in the
nature of marriage' under the 2005 Act must also fulfill the above
requirements, and in addition the parties must have lived together in a
`shared household' as defined in Section 2(s) of the Act. Merely spending
weekends together or a one night stand would not make it a `domestic
relationship'.
32. In our opinion not all live in relationships will amount to a relationship
in the nature of marriag8e to get the benefit of the Act of 2005. To get such
benefit the conditions mentioned by us above must be satisfied, and this has
to be proved by evidence. If a man has a `keep' whom he maintains
financially and uses mainly for sexual purpose and/or as a servant it would
not, in our opinion, be a relationship in the nature of marriage'
33. No doubt the view we are taking would exclude many women who have   
had a live in relationship from the benefit of the 2005 Act, but then it is not
for this Court to legislate or amend the law. Parliament has used the
expression `relationship in the nature of marriage' and not `live in
relationship'. The Court in the grab of interpretation cannot change the
language of the statute.
25      As per the principle enunciated in the case cited supra, in
order to constitute relationship in the nature of marriage, both
parties must be qualified to enter into a legal marriage.  In the
instant case, with effect from 10.11.2009, the first respondent is
entitled to marry another person or maintain relationship in the
nature of marriage provided the other person is also qualified to
enter into a legal marriage.  However, even if the first respondent
married the petitioner, their relationship will not fall within the
ambit of relationship in the nature of marriage as defined under
Section 2 (f) of the Act. In order to resolve the issue, this Court is
also placing reliance on the ratio laid down in Indra Sarma Vs.
V.K.V. Sarma  wherein the Honble apex Court after considering
various provisions of the Domestic Violence Act with reference to
the laws prevailing in other countries, held as under:
37. Reference to certain situations, in which the relationship between an
aggrieved person referred to in Section 2(a) and the respondent referred to in
Section 2(q) of the DV Act, would or would not amount to a relationship in
the nature of marriage, would be apposite. Following are some of the
categories of cases which are only illustrative:
a) Domestic relationship between an unmarried adult woman and an 
unmarried adult male: Relationship between an unmarried adult woman 
and an unmarried adult male who lived or, at any point of time lived
together in a shared household, will fall under the definition of Section 2(f)
of
the DV Act and in case, there is any domestic violence, the same will fall
under Section 3 of the DV Act and the aggrieved person can always seek
reliefs provided under Chapter IV of the DV Act.
b) Domestic relationship between an unmarried woman and a married adult 
male: Situations may arise when an unmarried adult women knowingly  
enters into a relationship with a married adult male. The question is
whether such a relationship is a relationship in the nature of marriage so as
to fall within the definition of Section 2(f) of the DV Act.
c) Domestic relationship between a married adult woman and an unmarried 
adult male: Situations may also arise where an adult married woman,
knowingly enters into a relationship with an unmarried adult male, the
question is whether such a relationship would fall within the expression
relationship in the nature of marriage.
d) Domestic relationship between an unmarried woman unknowingly enters  
into a relationship with a married adult male: An unmarried woman
unknowingly enters into a relationship with a married adult male, may, in a
given situation, fall within the definition of Section 2(f) of the DV Act and
such a relationship may be a relationship in the nature of marriage, so far
as the aggrieved person is concerned.
e) Domestic relationship between same sex partners (Gay and Lesbians): DV  
Act does not recognize such a relationship and that relationship cannot be
termed as a relationship in the nature of marriage under the Act.
Legislatures in some countries, like the Interpretation Act, 1984 (Western
Australia), the Interpretation Act, 1999 (New Zealand), the Domestic
Violence Act, 1998 (South Africa), the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims
Act, 2004 (U.K.), have recognized the relationship between the same sex
couples and have brought these relationships into the definition of Domestic
relationship.
63. We may now consider whether the tests, we have laid down, have been 
satisfied in the instant case. We have found that the appellant was not
ignorant of the fact that the respondent was a married person with wife and
two children, hence, was party to an adulterous and bigamous relationship.
Admittedly, the relationship between the appellant and respondent was
opposed by the wife of the respondent, so also by the parents of the
appellant and her brother and sister and they knew that they could not have
entered into a legal marriage or maintained a relationship in the nature of
marriage. Parties never entertained any intention to rear children and on
three occasions the pregnancy was terminated. Having children is a strong
circumstance to indicate a relationship in the nature of marriage. No
evidence has been adduced to show that the parties gave each other mutual
support and companionship. No material has been produced to show that 
the parties have ever projected or conducted themselves as husband and
wife and treated by friends, relatives and others, as if they are a married
couple. On the other hand, it is the specific case of the appellant that the
respondent had never held out to the public that she was his wife. No
evidence of socialization in public has been produced. There is nothing to
show that there was pooling of resources or financial arrangements between
them. On the other hand, it is the specific case of the appellant that the
respondent had never opened any joint account or executed any document  
in the joint name. Further, it was also submitted that the respondent never
permitted to suffix his name after the name of the appellant. No evidence is
forthcoming, in this case, to show that the respondent had caused any harm
or injuries or endangered the health, safely, life, limb or well- being, or
caused any physical or sexual abuse on the appellant, except that he did not
maintain her or continued with the relationship.
ALIENATION OF AFFECTION      
64. Appellant had entered into this relationship knowing well that the
respondent was a married person and encouraged bigamous relationship. By  
entering into such a relationship, the appellant has committed an
intentional tort, i.e. interference in the marital relationship with
intentionally
alienating respondent from his family, i.e. his wife and children. If the case
set up by the appellant is accepted, we have to conclude that there has been
an attempt on the part of the appellant to alienate respondent from his
family, resulting in loss of marital relationship, companionship, assistance,
loss of consortium etc., so far as the legally wedded wife and children of the
respondent are concerned, who resisted the relationship from the very
inception. Marriage and family are social institutions of vital importance.
Alienation of affection, in that context, is an intentional tort, as held by
this
Court in Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal case (supra), which gives a cause of
action to the wife and children of the respondent to sue the appellant for
alienating the husband/father from the company of his wife/children,
knowing fully well they are legally wedded wife/children of the respondent..
65. We are, therefore, of the view that the appellant, having been fully aware
of the fact that the respondent was a married person, could not have entered
into a live-in relationship in the nature of marriage. All live-in-
relationships
are not relationships in the nature of marriage. Appellants and the
respondents relationship is, therefore, not a relationship in the nature of
marriage because it has no inherent or essential characteristic of a marriage,
but a relationship other than in the nature of marriage and the appellants
status is lower than the status of a wife and that relationship would not fall
within the definition of domestic relationship under Section 2(f) of the DV
Act. If we hold that the relationship between the appellant and the
respondent is a relationship in the nature of a marriage, we will be doing an
injustice to the legally wedded wife and children who opposed that
relationship. Consequently, any act, omission or commission or conduct of
the respondent in connection with that type of relationship, would not
amount to domestic violence under Section 3 of the DV Act.
26      Even as per the observations of the Honble apex Court made
above, the relationship between the petitioner and the first
respondent will not come within the purview of relationship in the
nature of marriage as defined under Section 2 (f) of the DVC Act.
In the absence of domestic relationship between the petitioner and
the first respondent, the first respondent will not be recognized as
an aggrieved person as defined under Section 2 (a) of the Act. The
facts of the case on hand are identical to the facts of the case cited
supra.
27      Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and
also the principle enunciated in the cases cited supra, I have no
hesitation to hold that the first respondent is not an aggrieved
person to claim any relief under the provisions of the Domestic
Violence Act against the petitioner.
28      The next question that falls for consideration is whether this
Court can quash the proceedings in exercise of inherent powers
under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
29      The various remedies provided under the DVC Act are purely
civil in nature.  There is no element of criminality in the reliefs
sought by the aggrieved person under the Domestic Violence Act.
As per Section 27 of the Act, the Judicial Magistrate of I Class or
Metropolitan Magistrate concerned is competent to pass
appropriate orders under the Act.  Section 28 of the Act mandates
that the Judicial Magistrate of I Class has to follow the procedure
contemplated under Cr.P.C. while granting the reliefs.  The various
reliefs provided under the Act are remedial in nature.
30      In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal , the Honble apex Court
held as under:
1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima-facie constitute any offence or make out a case
against the accused.
2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers Under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within
the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and
the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.  
4. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is
permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as
contemplated Under Section 155(2) of the Code.
5. Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever
reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused.
6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of
the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is
instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or
where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide
and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior
motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite
him due to private and personal grudge.
31      The Honble apex Court in R.P.Kapoor v State of Punjab ,
held as hereunder:
        "Cases may also arise where the allegations in the F.I.R. or the
complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not constitute the offence alleged. In such cases, no question
of appreciating evidence arises; it is a matter merely of looking at the
complaint or the First Information Report to decide whether the offence
alleged is disclosed or not. In this case it would be legitimate to the High
Court to hold that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the process of
the criminal court to be issued against the accused person."

32      As per the principle enunciated in the cases cited supra, the
Court can quash the proceedings if the allegations made in the
complaint are inherently improbable and if continuation of
proceedings would amount to abuse of process of Court.  In the
instant case, the allegations made in the complaint are bereft of
the basic ingredients of clauses (a), (f) and (s) of Section 2 of the
Act.
33      For the foregoing discussion, I am of the considered view
that continuation of proceedings against the petitioner is nothing
but abuse of process of law and hence liable to be quashed.
34      In the result, the Criminal petition is allowed and the
proceedings against the petitioner in DVC No.149 of 2010 on the
file of IV Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad are hereby quashed.
As a sequel, the miscellaneous petitions, pending in this Criminal
Petition, if any, shall stand closed.

ORDER: (Per Honble Sri Justice Vilas V. Afzulpurkar)

        A Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 14.06.2013 has
disagreed with the view expressed by the earlier Division Bench in
A.P.S.F.D. & W ASSOCIATION v. DISTRICT COLLECTOR,        
VISAKHAPATNAM  and referred questions a to c to be heard and  
decided by a larger Bench. In terms of the said order of reference,
this writ petition is posted before us and we are required to answer the
questions framed in the order of reference. The questions for
consideration are extracted hereunder:

a.      Whether A.P. Lokayukta has jurisdiction to entertain a
complaint, which does not involve an allegation, or a
complaint regarding non-implementation of an order of a
Magistrate in a matrimonial dispute between a wife and
husband, or any other dispute inter se private
individuals, and pass consequential orders?

b.      Whether the A.P. Lokayukta can issue directions or pass
an order directly against the persons mentioned in
clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 7(1) of the Act?

c.      Whether A.P. Lokayukta can take action suo motu under the  
Act? 

2.      The brief facts of the case are succinctly set out in the order of
reference. Hence, for the sake of convenience, the facts, as set out in
the order, are reproduced hereunder:
2. The brief facts of the case are as under:

The petitioner and respondent No.3, who are said to be doctors
by profession, got married on 23-06-2002 at Sri Satyasai
Nigamagamam Kalyana Mandapam, Hyderabad, and out of      
their wedlock, they begot two children. Thereafter, disputes
arose between them and respondent No.3 filed D.V.C.No.390 of 
2012 on the file of III Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad;
Crime No.457 of 2012 on the file Women Police Station, CCS, 
DD, Hyderabad for the offences punishable under Sections 498-
A, 420 IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act;
Crime No.94 of 2012 on the file of CID Police Station,
Hyderabad, for the offences punishable under Sections 403,
409, 418, 420, 468, 471 read with 120-B of IPC; Crime No.383
of 2012 on the file of Kachiguda Police Station, Hyderabad, for
the offences punishable under Section 506 IPC and Crime 
No.421 of 2012 on the file of Narayanaguda Police Station,
Hyderabad, for the offences punishable under Sections 418 and
420 of IPC. Apart from that, civil cases are pending between
them. 

3.      Respondent No.3 filed Crl.M.P.No.1317 of 2012 in
D.V.C.No.390 of 2012, seeking protection order.
The learned Magistrate, by order dated 13-12-2012, disposed
of the said Crl.M.P. directing the respondents therein i.e., the
petitioner herein and his family members, to allot and allocate
two bedrooms, drawing hall, dining and kitchen with three
bathrooms to the petitioner in the 2nd floor of the house for
exclusive occupation of the petitioner and her children and
consequently restrain the respondents or any of their relatives
from entering into such allotted and allocated portions. He
directed the protection officer to implement the order and to file
report by the next date of hearing. Subsequently, the learned
Magistrate, by order dated 16-01-2013, made the interim order
dated 13-12-2012 absolute, but with a slight modification that
the petitioner and her children shall use two bathrooms only
preferably those that are attached to the two bedrooms allotted
to her and further both parties are directed not to create any
problems to each other and maintain peace and harmony while 
residing in the shared household until furthers. He directed the
protection officer to implement the said orders forthwith
without any delay and to report the same to the Court as early
as possible, and also observed that derogation in
implementation of the said order will be viewed seriously. The
Protection Officer was given liberty to take the assistance of
concerned police for implementation of the order.

4.      However, complaining non-implementation of the said
order, respondent No.3 filed complaint No.3093/2012/B1
before respondent No.1 i.e., A.P. Lokayukta, stating that in
spite of the protection orders passed by the learned Magistrate,
the same is not honoured by the petitioner and his parents, and
they are not allowing her and her family members to live in the
areas which have been allotted by the Magistrate in the
protection order, and the police held is also not effective in
implementing the orders. The Lokayukta entertained the
complaint and, after calling for the reports from the concerned
officers, by order dated 12-02-2013 directed the Deputy
Director (Investigation) to go over to the place at Barkatpura
and oversee strict observance and adherence to the aforesaid
orders dated 16-01-2013 passed by the learned Magistrate. The
Lokayukta further directed the Deputy Director (Investigation)
to give instructions to the Protection Officer and the concerned
SHO to be present at the time of the inspection. Thereafter,
series of orders were passed by the Lokayukta.

5.      Aggrieved by the action of the Lokayukta in entertaining
the complaint made by respondent No.3 and in passing the 
consequential directions, the petitioner filed the present writ
petition seeking the reliefs stated above.

3.      Mr. L. Ravichander, learned senior counsel for the petitioner,
has contended that under the A.P. Lokayukta Act, 1983 (for short
the Act) the Lokayukta had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint
filed by the third respondent and as such, the complaint before the
Lokayukta itself is not maintainable. Learned senior counsel also
contended that assuming that the Lokayukta had jurisdiction,
the three impugned orders passed by the Lokayukta are beyond the 
purview of the Act. Learned senior counsel had taken us through the
various provisions of the Act to substantiate his contentions by placing
strong reliance upon Section 7 of the Act, which provides for the
matters, which can be investigated by the Lokayukta or the
Upa-Lokayukta. Learned senior counsel would contend that the 
matrimonial dispute between the petitioner and the third respondent,
which is pending in a separate proceeding under the Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the complaints pending   
before the police do not fall within the purview of the Lokayukta.

4.      In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel places
strong reliance upon the definition of the terms allegation and action
employed in Section 7 of the Act. Learned senior counsel would
contend that the examination of the complaint by the third respondent
before the Lokayukta would show that the complaint neither satisfies
the word allegation nor the word action, as defined under the Act
and thereby, Section 7 of the Act is not attracted. Learned senior
counsel also alternatively submits that the impugned orders passed by
the Lokayukta are contrary to the restricted power vested in the
Lokayukta under Section 11 of the Act and points out that Section
10(4)(c) of the Act mandates that when other remedies are available
to the complainant, which are more appropriate for the complainant to
avail, it was sufficient for the Lokayukta to refuse to investigate into
the complaint of the third respondent. Learned senior counsel also
placed reliance upon Section 12 of the Act to substantiate that the
report of the Lokayukta is required to be made to the competent
authority for appropriate action, thereby, the report of the Lokayukta
is only recommendatory in nature and based on the report, it is for the
competent authority to take appropriate action and it is not for the
Lokayukta or the Upa-Lokayukta to take action or issue directions.
Various decisions of this Court are also cited at the bar, reference to
which would be made hereunder at appropriate place.

5.      While there was no representation on behalf of the learned
standing counsel for the first respondent, Mr. Peri Prabhakar, learned
counsel appearing for the third respondent opposed the writ petition
by contenting that the allegations in the complaint of the third
respondent before the Lokayukta would itself substantiate that her
complaint, which is pending as Cr.No.94 of 2012 before the CID has
not been investigated and steps taken by the complainant by
approaching the Protection Officer at District Collectors Officer also
remained unredressed and that her complaint before the Women  
Police Station, CCS and DCP, East Zone remained without initiating
any action. The third respondent had, therefore, no option but to
invoke the jurisdiction of the Lokayukta requesting for monitoring her
complaints and to immediately take up the complaint before the
Protection Officer, DVC by passing necessary orders. Learned counsel
would submit that the third respondent had, accordingly, complained
of complete inaction on the part of the authorities concerned and
thereby, the Lokayukta was justified in taking up the complaint.

6.      Learned counsel for the third respondent, therefore, justified the
aforesaid orders passed by the Lokayukta as within his jurisdiction by
making reference to various provisions of the Act and the Rules framed
thereunder. Learned counsel, further, contended on the basis of
definition of action cognizable by the Lokayukta that the Lokayukta
has jurisdiction to investigate even the grievance in respect of any
action as provided under Section 9 of the Act and relied upon the
definition of grievance under Section 2(ea) of the Act.
Learned counsel also relied upon the definition of Mal administration
under Section 2(fa) of the Act to substantiate that wilful negligence in
taking action or the administration procedure or practice governing
such action involving undue delay is also cognizable by the Lokayukta.
Learned counsel would submit that the procedure prescribed for taking
action on the complaint is provided under Sections 9 and 10 of the Act
wherein under Section 10(2) of the Act the Lokayukta is empowered to
conduct preliminary verification in private and learned counsel places
reliance upon and in particular on definition of preliminary verification
under Rule 2(1)(viii) of the Andhra Pradesh Lokayukta and
Upa-Lokayukta (Investigation) Rules, 1984 (for short the Rules).
Learned counsel also relied upon Rule 5 of the Rules, which deals with
preliminary verification and which provides that on hearing the
complainant and on being satisfied that the complaint contains
verifiable details justifying further action, to call for information,
remarks, reports and further requiring any investigating agency to
probe into the allegations and submit report and on being satisfied
that there is prima facie case for conducting investigation into the
allegation in the complaint, the Lokayukta may pass an order to that
effect and direct the concerned officer of the institution to take
necessary steps in that regard. Emphasis is also laid on Rule 22,
which provides that the Lokayukta is empowered to give such
directions as may be necessary for giving effect to the provisions of
the Act and the Rules and such orders.

7.      Learned counsel also places strong reliance upon the decision in
A.P.S.F.D. & W ASSOCIATIONs case (1 supra), which supports his   
contentions. Learned counsel would also submit that the order of
reference by the Division Bench did not consider the Rules and placed
reliance upon two decisions of the Supreme Court in CHIEF FOREST   
CONSERVATOR (WILDLIFE) v. NISAR KHAN , particularly para 19      
and P. KASILINGAM v. P.S.G. COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY ,          
particularly para 20.

Question No.1: 

8.      The invocation of jurisdiction of the Lokayukta as envisaged
under the Act is with a specific purpose and intent, as set out in the
objects and reasons. The A.P. Lokayukta Act, enacted in 1983 as AP 
Act 11 of 1983, was amended by AP Act 1 of 2007 and AP Act 11 of  
2011. The statements and objects, to the extent relevant for this case,
provide that it is an Act to make provision for the appointment and
functions of the Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta for investigation of
administrative action taken by or on behalf of the Government of
Andhra Pradesh or certain local and public authorities in the State of
Andhra Pradesh (including any omission and commission in connection  
with or arising out of such action) in certain cases and for matter
connected therewith. By AP Act 1 of 2007, so far as is relevant,
Section 2(a), as amended, was substituted and the definition of public
servant under Section 2(k) was further expanded. The other
amendments are not relevant for the purpose of this case.
Further, under the amendment Act 11 of 2011 it was noticed that in
the Act there was no mention of filing of complaint of grievance with
regard to administrative action or maladministration, therefore,
the words grievance and maladministration were defined and Section
2(i) was also amended to define the word officer as to mean
a person appointed to public service in the State. To the extent of
providing limitation, Section 8(2) was substituted by amended
provision and new Section 13-A was also inserted.

9.      For answering the questions posed, it is necessary to notice text
of some of the provisions of the Act, as extracted hereunder:
Sec. 7. Matters which may be investigated by Lokayukta
or Upa-Lokayukta:-

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Lokayukta may
investigate any action which is taken by, or with the general or
specific approval of, or at the behest of,-

(i) a Minister or a Secretary; or

(ii) a Member of either House of the State Legislature; or

(iii) a Mayor of the Municipal Corporation constituted by or
under the relevant law for the time being in force; or

(iii) a Vice Chancellor or a Registrar of a University

(iv) any other public servant, belonging to such class or section
of public servants, as may be notified by the Government in
this behalf after consultation with the Lokayukta, in any case
where a Complaint involving an allegation is made in respect of
such action, or such action can be or could have been, in the
opinion of the Lokayukta, the subject of an allegation.

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Upa-Lokayukta
may investigate any action which is taken by, or with the
general or specific approval of, any public servant, other than
those referred to in sub-section (1), in any case where a
complaint involving an allegation is made in respect of such
action, or such action can be or could have been, in the opinion
of the Upa-Lokayukta, the subject of an allegation.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in sub-section (2), the Lokayukta
may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, investigate any
allegation in respect of an action which may be investigated by
the Upa-Lokayukta under that sub-section, whether or not
complaint has been made to the Lokayukta in respect of such 
action.

(4) Where two or more Upa-Lokayuktas are appointed under  
this Act, the Lokayukta may, by general or special order, assign
to each of them matters which may be investigated by them 
under this Act:

       Provided that no investigation made by the
Upa-Lokayukta under this Act and no action taken or thing
done by him in respect of such investigation shall be called in
question on the ground only that such investigation relates to a
matter which is not assigned to him by such order.

10.     So far as any other public servant is concerned, clause (iv) of
sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Act is relevant for our purpose.
It may be noticed that the said provision empowers investigation by
Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta where the complaint involves an 
allegation in respect of an action or in the opinion of Lokayukta such
action can be or could have been the subject of an allegation.
Thus, the words action and allegation used in the aforesaid
provisions are required to be understood in the context of the
definition of the said words under Section 2(a) and 2(b) of the Act.
They are, accordingly, extracted hereunder:
2(a) action means an administrative action taken by a public
servant by way of decision, recommendation or finding or in
any other manner, and includes any omission and commission  
in connection with or arising out of such action; and all other
expressions connecting action shall be construed accordingly;

2(b) allegation in relation to a public servant means any
affirmation that such public servant-

(i)     has abused his position as such, to obtain any gain or
favour to himself or to any other person, or to cause
undue harm or hardship to any other person;

(ii)    was actuated in the discharge of his functions as such
public servant by improper or corrupt motive and
thereby caused loss to the State or any member or
section of the public; or
(iii)   is guilty of corruption, or lack of integrity in his capacity
as such public servant;

       It would be immediately noticed that to satisfy the definition of
allegation either of the sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) has to be satisfied
viz. abuse of position to obtain a gain or favour to the public servant
himself or to any other person or cause undue harm to any other
person is essential for sub-clause (i). Similarly, discharge of functions
on account of improper or corrupt motive, which results in loss to the
State or any other member of the public, is essential for sub-clause (ii)
and the public servant, who is guilty of corruption or lack of integrity
will attract sub-clause (iii).

11.     In contrast to the above, definition of action, as defined, means
an administrative action of a public servant by way of a decision,
recommendation or finding or in any other manner including omissions
or commissions. Thus, while appreciating the word action,
the qualification to allegation as required under sub-clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of clause (b) of Section 2 of the Act, seemingly, appears to be
not attracted. Learned counsel for the third respondent, therefore,
proceeded to contend that any action including omission or
commission is cognizable by the Lokayukta. However, Section 7(1)(iv)
of the Act, extracted above, would show that the word action used
under that provision is linked with the word allegation.
Thus, any action which has been taken or can be taken or could have
been taken must be related to allegation. In other words, therefore,
the word action must be actuated by any of the motives under
sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (b) of Section 2 of the Act.
Thus, it clearly excludes any action unconnected with the allegation.
The words action and allegation, as used in the Act, have, therefore,
to be read and understood conjointly and not in isolation. It, therefore,
appears to us that it is not every action or inaction, which falls within
the purview of Section 7 of the Act but only such actions or omissions,
which involve an allegation or could involve an allegation, alone are
subject to investigation under Section 7 of the Act. As a fortiori,
therefore, it is not every action or inaction, which is cognizable under
Section 7 of the Act, as redressal for such actions or inactions is
otherwise available under judicial review by the Constitutional Courts.
The Legislature, therefore, specifically enacted the AP Act 11 of 1983
with a view to provide a mechanism for redressal of actions, which are
actuated with allegations, as defined and that also explains Section 22
of the Act, which states that the provisions of this Act are in addition
to the existing enactment or rule or law for which remedy is any other
manner available. The institution of Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta
cannot, therefore, be understood as an alternative mechanism created
by the Legislature for judicial review of any action or omission and on
the contrary, under the said special law, actions or inactions involving
allegations alone fall within the domain of Lokayukta or
Upa-Lokayukta, as the case may be.  

12.     The said question already fell for consideration before a Division
Bench in S. JAGADEESWAR v. THE LOK AYUKTA OF ANDHRA             
PRADESH  and in para 6 of the decision, it is held as follows:
6.  A reading of the definition makes it further clear that the
allegation has to be about some particular act which may be
either a commission or omission but never a vague submission
or a generalised one. Section 9 of the Act prescribes the
manner in which the complaints are made saying that every
complaint shall be made in such form and shall be accompanied 
by such affidavits as may be prescribed. The complaint has to
relate, under the section, to an allegation in respect of any
action.

        The said question again fell for consideration before another
Division Bench (to which one of us, VVA, J, is a party) in WP.No.10492
of 2000 dated 27.08.2009 titled, C. RAGHUPATI v. UPALOKAYUKTA,     
wherein interpreting the words action and allegation, it was held in
para 8 and para 10, relevant portion, as under:
8. It is to be noticed that in order to constitute an allegation
under the above provision, the public servant must have
abused his position to obtain any gain or favour to himself or to
any other person, or to cause undue harm or hardship to any
other person. The abuse of position must be linked with gain or
favour to the public servant himself or any other person or
undue harm or hardship to any other person and the public
servant must have been actuated in the discharge of his
functions by improper or corrupt motive and thereby caused to
the State or any member or section of the public. Both the said
ingredients must be satisfied in order to justify action under the
Act with respect to an allegation. The word allegation as
defined under the Act is, therefore, specifically couched by the
legislature in a language which makes it mandatory that the
twin ingredients are necessary to be fulfilled. The existence and
satisfaction of such essential ingredients therefore amounts to
an existence of jurisdictional fact for exercise of the power
under the Act  

10. It would also substantiate that the word action defined
under Section 2 (a) of the Act has necessarily to be in
connection with and to be read along with definition of
allegation and is not as if mere action without proving an
allegation is sufficient. The contention of the learned counsel for
1st respondent in that respect is, therefore, not sustainable.

       Even in the order of reference, the Division Bench recorded its
opinion in para 17 in the following words:
17. It is not every administrative action taken by the persons
mentioned in clauses (i) to (iv) which can be investigated under
Section 7(1), but only an action in respect of which an
allegation is made in a complaint or an action which can, in the
opinion of the Lokayukta, be the subject of an allegation.
Section 7(1) read with Section 2(a) and (b) of the Act shows
that it is only an administrative action taken by persons,
mentioned in clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 7(1), in abuse of
their position to obtain any gain or favour, or to cause undue
harm or hardship, or is actuated by improper or corrupt motive
and has thereby caused loss to the State or any member of the
section of the public, or for corrupt motives, which can be
investigated by the Lokayukta. Investigation of administrative
action, which does not relate an allegation as defined in Section
2(b), is beyond the scope of Section 7(1) of the Act. As an
investigation cannot be caused into any administrative action,
which does not involve an allegation, no preliminary verification
can be caused into such administrative action also.

13.     We record our concurrence with the aforesaid view and as
discussed above, it has to be held that any action, which falls within
sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the Act or any administrative action by
a public servant, which has nexus with the allegation, as above,
alone falls within the domain of jurisdiction of the Lokayukta or
Upa-Lokayukta and not every action or inaction, which has no nexus
with the allegation as defined under the Act.

14.     At this stage, it would be appropriate to examine the decision
relied upon by the learned counsel for the third respondent in
A.P.S.F.D. & W ASSOCIATIONs case (1 supra) wherein another    
Division Bench was called upon to examine this question arising out of
order passed by the Lokayukta issuing directions to appoint certain
persons in Gangavaram Port Limited as part of Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Package. In that context, while upholding the said order,
the Division Bench held in para 18 as follows:
18.  In our considered opinion, even when a representation
cannot be treated as a complaint containing an allegation but
complaining an action, inaction or omission by or at the best of
public servant, HTL is bound to conduct preliminary verification
if he is of opinion that such preliminary verification is necessary
in the interest of accountability, purity and transparency of
administration. We are also convinced that preliminary
verification into all complaints need not lead to investigation
and report under Section 12 of the Act warranting disciplinary
action against the erring public servant. In his discretion,
HTL can at the stage of preliminary verification itself set right
the action as well as actors so as to reduce effects of mal
administration. In every complaint, there need not be charges
of corruption or corrupt motive and even in such cases,
it is competent for HTL to summon the public servants alleged
of inaction, action and of commission and can express
displeasure so that a strong message goes out that there is
omnipresent HTL to oversee administrative excesses.
The reasons for this conclusion are as follows.

       The Division Bench, further, proceeded to hold in para 21 as
follows:
21.  A complaint may not contain the allegations as defined
under Section 2(b) of the Act. But an averment in complaint
that the inaction or omission or commission resulted in
hardship to complaint would be sufficient to attract the
jurisdiction of HTL.

15.     With great respect, we are unable to accept the said view and in
our opinion such interpretation would be contrary to Section 7(1)(iv)
of the Act as mere action without its nexus with the allegation would
not be in the domain of the Lokayukta. Had that been the intent of the
Legislature, Section 7(1)(iv) of the Act would not have clarified the
word action by linking it with the word allegation. Thus, it is not that
each and every action or omission is cognizable, as rightly found by
three other Division Benches of this Court, as extracted above.
In our opinion, therefore, the aforesaid decision deserves to be
overruled and is accordingly overruled.

16.     So far as two decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for
the third respondent are concerned, the decision in CHIEF FOREST 
CONSERVATORs case (2 supra) is a case of licensing arising under  
the Wild Life (Protection) Act. Learned counsel relied upon only one
sentence in para 19 of the said judgment, which is as under:
19. It is now well settled that when rules are validly framed,
they should be treated as a part of the Act 

        Another decision in P. KASILINGAMs case (3 supra) is a case 
arising out of T.N. Private Colleges (Regulation) Act, 1976 and learned
counsel for the third respondent relied upon a passage in para 20 of
the decision, which is as under:
20.  It is accepted principle of statutory constructions that
rules made under a statute are a legitimate aid to construction
of the statute as contemporanea expositio (See: Craies on
Statute law, 7th Edn., pp. 157-158; Tata Engineering and
Locomotive co. Ltd. v. Gram Panchayat, Pimpri Waghere)  
[(1976) 4 SCC 177  

17.     Based on the above decisions, learned counsel for the third
respondent placed strong reliance upon Rules 5 and 22 of the Rules
and the definition of preliminary verification as defined under
Rule 2(1)(viii) of the Rules, which is as under:
2(1)(viii) Preliminary verification means any inquiry or
other proceedings conducted by the Lokayukta or Upa- 
Lokayukta in connection with a complaint or on his own motion
for the purpose of satisfying himself as to whether there are
any grounds for conducting an investigation into such
complaint.

        Learned counsel would submit that under Rule 5 of the Rules,
after registration of a complaint, Lokayukta or Up-Lokayukta,
as the case may be, is empowered to make their own preliminary 
investigation and is empowered to call for remarks, information, report
from any Departmental Authority or Officer and require any
investigating agency to probe into the allegations in the complaint and
submit report.

       Rule 22 of the Rules provide as follows:
22. Power of Lokayukta to give directions: -
The Lokayukta may, by order not inconsistent with these rules,
provide for matters for which no provision has been made in
these rules, and may give such directions as may be necessary 
for giving effect to the provisions of the Act, the rules and such
orders.

        Learned counsel would contend that after examining the
complainant/third respondent, the Lokayukta issued necessary 
direction to conduct preliminary investigation in terms of Rule 5 of the
Rules and on being satisfied, gave appropriate directions for which also
Rule 22 of the Rules empowers the Lokayukta. 

18.     We find it difficult to accept the said submissions for two
principal reasons viz. firstly, the Rules cannot override the provisions
of the Act and have always been held to supplement the Act and not to
supplant the Act. Secondly, the submissions of the learned counsel
overlooks the definition of complaint under Rule 2(1)(iii) of the Rules,
which is extracted hereunder:

2(1)(iii) Complaint means a statement made in writing to
the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta by a complainant containing 
an allegation against a public servant in respect of an action
taken by such public servant.

        It would be immediately noticed that a complaint necessitating
action by the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta must be such, which  
contains an allegation against public servant. Obviously, therefore,
where the complaint lacks any allegation it cannot be a complaint
within the meaning of the Act and no further action is warranted under
the Act. Copy of the complaint, in the present case, merely sets out
the hardship caused to the third respondent arising out a matrimonial
dispute with the petitioner wherein she is stated to have already given
a complaint, which is registered as an FIR, and she also states about
the complaint having been lodged before the CBCID and the crime
registered thereunder. The third respondent also speaks of invocation
of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the 
action required to be taken by the Protection Officer, which he failed to
take and that the police authorities failed to investigate her
complaints. In the conclusion, therefore, the third respondent seeks
the Institution of Lokayukta to monitor the complaints including the
one made before the Protection Officer and pass necessary orders.
At best, therefore, the complaint discloses alleged inaction but there is
no semblance of an allegation as defined under the Act and cannot be
said to fall within the definition of complaint under Rule 2(1)(iii) of the
Rules. Obviously, therefore, in the absence of satisfaction of the
necessary ingredients, the complaint did not fall within the domain of
Section 7 of the Act. Consequently, therefore, the crucial jurisdictional
fact was clearly absent and thereby, the entertainment of the
complaint by the Lokayukta was clearly impermissible under the Act.

19.     So far as three impugned directions given by the Lokayukta are
concerned, learned counsel for the third respondent defended the said
orders under Rule 22 of the Rules by contending that they are part of
preliminary verification permissible under Rule 5 of the Rules.
We are, however, of the view that when the Act itself does not
empower the Lokayukta to issue any directions of the nature,
as issued under the impugned order, neither the Rules can be read so
as to defeat the object and purpose of the Act nor the Rules can
override the provisions of the Act. The power of Lokayukta to
undertake preliminary verification arises only in the event of
registration of the complaint and on its, prima facie, satisfaction that
all the essential ingredients required to be maintained in the complaint
under Section 7 of the Act are satisfied. Thus, as discussed above,
when the complaint of the third respondent sans any such allegation
cognizable under Section 7 of the Act, all further proceedings including
the impugned orders, in our view, cannot be sustained.

20.     We, accordingly, answer question No.1 in the negative and hold
that the Lokayukta has no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint,
which neither involves an allegation nor involves any action or inaction
connected with such an allegation. We also hold that inter se private
disputes between the parties including matrimonial dispute does not
fall within the purview of the jurisdiction of the Lokayukta under the
Act and that only such acts, which are actuated by allegation against
public servants and the authorities as named under Section 7 of the
Act alone fall within the domain of the Lokayukta or Upa-Lokayukta,
as the case may be. The discussion, as above, also answers question 
No.2 in the negative. Question No.3, however, does not arise on the
facts and circumstances of the case and would amount to adjudication
on hypothetical question. Hence, the said question is left open.

       Reference is answered accordingly.

        A reference was made to the Full Bench vide order dated
14.06.2013. We have heard learned counsel for parties appearing on
two sittings on 10.07.2015 and 24.07.2015. Today this reference is
posted for pronouncement of judgment. Before pronouncement of the 
judgment, Mr. P.V. Vidya Sagar, learned standing counsel for
respondent No.1, Lokayukta, submitted that he has filed a
miscellaneous petition bearing WPMP(SR).No.154387 of 2015   
yesterday and that it may be heard before pronouncement of the
judgment. 
        When we asked Mr. P.V. Vidya Sagar about the prayer in the 
miscellaneous petition, he submitted that respondent No.1, Lokayukta,
was not heard when the reference was heard on 10.07.2015 and 
24.07.2015. We are informed by the Court Officer, on the basis of
record, that Mr. P.V. Vidya Sagar was present when the matter was
heard on two different dates. We do not know why he did not make
any submissions on behalf of respondent No.1. Despite this, we called
for the miscellaneous petition filed on behalf of respondent No.1 to
know and understand what is it about, but, we are informed that in
view of the objections, the said petition has been returned by the
Registry. In view thereof, the question of hearing miscellaneous
petition does not arise and hence, we proceeded to pronounce the
judgment.

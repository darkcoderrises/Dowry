THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE M.SEETHARAMA MURTI           

Criminal Petition No.8112 of 2012
ORDER:  
                This is a Criminal Petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (the CrPC, for brevity) by the petitioners, who are the
respondents 2 to 6 in D.V.C.No.18 of 2012 on the file of the learned VI
Metropolitan Magistrate, Medchal, Ranga Reddy District, requesting to quash
the proceedings against them in the said DV Case.

2.              I have heard the submissions of the learned counsel for the
petitioners, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/applicant in the DV
Case and the learned Public Prosecutor representing the 1st respondent-State.  I
have perused the material record. The parties hereinafter shall be referred to
as the petitioners and the 2nd respondent as arrayed in this criminal petition.

3.              The introductory facts, in brief, are as follows: The 2nd
respondent herein, by name, P. Anantha Lakshmi is the wife of P.Giri Babu, the
1st respondent in the DV Case.  The present petitioners are the brothers-in-law,
co-sister and sister-in-law of the 2nd respondent herein.  The 2nd respondent
herein had filed a case under the provisions of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (the Act, for brevity) seeking orders for
protection under Section 18, Residence Order under Section 19, monetary relief
under Section 20, custody order under Section 21 and compensation order 
under Section 22 of the Act. In fact, in the DV case, she had also sought
prohibition of alienation of assets besides Rs.35,000/- towards monthly
maintenance and a compensation of Rs.50,00,000/-.  The total amount claimed 
by her is Rs.50,00,000/-.  She had also earlier filed a case against her husband
for the offence punishable under Section 498-A of the IPC and the said case is
stated to be pending in the Court at Medchal.

4.              Now, the points for determination are:
1.      Whether the petitioners had made out valid and sufficient
grounds for quashing the proceedings against them in DVC 18 
of 2012?

2.      Whether the uncontroverted allegations made in the complaint
of the 2nd respondent do not disclose even a prima facie case
against the petitioners?

3.      Whether the application of the 2nd respondent should not have
been entertained by the learned Magistrate against the
petitioners without discussing the domestic and legal
relationship of the petitioners with the 2nd respondent?
5.              POINTS:  

5.              (a)     The case pleaded by the petitioners in support of the
request for quashing the proceedings against them in the DV case, is as under:
According to the case of the 2nd respondent, while she was studying B.Com 2nd
year, she fell in love with the 1st respondent in the DV case. After her
marriage
with the 1st respondent in the DV case, they had lived together for some time.
Under the lawful wedlock, she gave birth to a girl child.  According to the 2nd
respondent, she was subjected to harassment by her husband and that her 
husband made demands for additional dowry.  Her husband had threatened her  
that he would marry a second time if she failed to bring the dowry amount.
On account of the harassment, she went away to her parents house at
Hyderabad.  Thus, the 2nd respondent had not made a single allegation against
the present petitioners.  They are living separately. However, a DV case is
filed
by the 2nd respondent against her husband and also the present petitioners.
The learned Magistrate has taken the case on file.  The marriage between the
2nd respondent and her husband is a love marriage and after their marriage in
the year 2004, they both had lived separately.  Except the blood relation, there
is no other business or joint family relationship between the 2nd respondent on
one hand and the petitioners herein on the other.  All the petitioners are
residents of Bheemarajuvari Street, Ongole of Prakasam District.  At no point of
time, the 2nd respondent and her husband on one hand and the petitioners on
the other lived under one roof.  There is no domestic relationship between
the 2nd respondent and her husband on one hand and the petitioners on the
other.  At no point of time, the petitioners and the 2nd respondent had lived
together in a shared household.  The petitioners are facing much trouble in
traveling from Ongole to Medchal, which is at a distance of more than 240 KMs.
They are not involved in any offences.  The continuation of DV case against
them is an abuse of process of Court and law.  Hence, the present petition is
filed for quashing the proceedings against them.

5.              (b)     At the time of hearing, the learned counsel for the
petitioners had reiterated the case pleaded in the petition.   Along with the
petition, the copy of the household card of the 5th petitioner and his wife, who
is the 2nd petitioner, is filed showing that they are residents of
Bheemarajuvari 
Street, Ongole of Prakasam District.  Similarly, the household card of the 4th
petitioner and his wife Ramanamma, i.e., the 3rd petitioner is filed showing
that they are also residents of Ongole of Prakasam District. Similarly, the copy
of the household card of the 1st petitioners husband P.Rama Rao is filed
showing that she is a resident of Vijayawada of Krishna District.

5.              (c)     The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent had forcefully
contended that the petitioners herein, who are the respondents 2 to 6 in the
DV case are admittedly relatives of the husband of the 2nd respondent herein
and that they are related by blood or consanguinity and marriage and that in
the DV case it is specifically averred that the husband of the 2nd respondent
had harassed the 2nd respondent by making demands for additional dowry and  
that he used to abuse her in filthy language and torture her, both mentally and
physically and that he had taken away forcefully her pusthela thadu and had
abused the 2nd respondent a number of times for not getting additional dowry
and that the mediations held by the elders did not yield any results and that
the husband of the 2nd respondent did not even provide food to her and used to
confine her to the house by locking her in the house and that on account of the
ill treatment meted out to the 2nd respondent by her husband, her health was
spoiled and therefore, she was constrained to file the DV case.  Thus, he has
reiterated the contents in the DV case while admitting that the 5 year old
daughter is with the husband of the 2nd respondent.

5.              (d)     I have bestowed my attention to the facts and the
submissions of the learned counsel for both the sides.  Earlier, on the
complaint of the 2nd respondent herein, a case in Crime No.204 of 2010 was
registered by the Station House Officer, I Town Police Station, Ongole for the
offences punishable under Sections 363, 365, 384, 420, 464, 465 and 498-A of
the IPC against the husband of the 2nd respondent, the petitioners herein and
two others, namely, the husband of the 1st petitioner-P.Sugunamma herein and
one Sai Bhargav, who is the Son of the 4th petitioner herein.  All the
petitioners
in the said crime had filed Criminal Petition No.9382 of 2010.  This Court, by a
common order dated 04.10.2012 made in Crl.P.Nos.9382 and 9492 of 2010   
quashed the proceedings in the aforementioned crime 204 of 2010 of I Town
Police Station, Ongole.  It is undisputed that the 2nd respondent had much
earlier gave a report to the Station House Officer, Jeedimetla on 05.08.2010 to
the effect that she was subjected to harassment by all the accused and that on
25.06.2010, A1 had approached her and forcefully obtained her signature on
divorce and other papers.  This Court, in the said order observed that the
allegations made in the subsequent report are all false and therefore, quashed
the proceedings in the aforementioned crime.  Therefore, as rightly contended,
the present D V case is a fresh case after the proceedings against the
petitioners herein and others in the earlier crime registered for the alleged
offences punishable under the provisions of the IPC were quashed as per the
orders of this Court.  In the DV case allegations were made only against the
husband who was arraigned as the 1st respondent in that case but no allegations
much less specific allegations attributing any acts or omissions constituting
domestic violence are made against the present petitioners.

5.              (e)     Coming next to the contention that the learned
Magistrate ought not to have taken the case on file against the present
petitioners for the reason that they have no domestic relationship and
that they have never shared the household or lived together in a shared
household with the 2nd respondent and her husband, it is necessary to
refer to the relevant provisions.  Under Section 12 of the Act, an
aggrieved person may present an application to the Magistrate seeking
one or more reliefs under the Act.

      Section 2 (a) defines aggrieved person; and, it reads as follows:

2 (a)   aggrieved person means any woman who is, or has been, in 
a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to have
been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent.


The above definition makes a reference to domestic relationship
between the aggrieved woman and the respondent in the DV case.  The 
definition also makes a reference to domestic violence.
      Domestic relationship which is defined in Section 2(f) reads as
under:

2 (f)   domestic relationship means a relationship between two
persons who live or have, at any point of time, lived together  in a
shared household, when they are related by consanguinity,
marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage,
adoption or are family members living together as a joint family

Thus, Section 2 (f) of the Act dealing with domestic relationship refers
to shared household; and, shared household as defined in Section 2(s)
reads as follows:
2 (s)   shared household means a household where the person  
aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship
either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a
household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the
aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned or tenanted by
either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or
the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right, title,
interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong
to the joint family of which the respondent is a member,
irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has
any right, title or interest in the shared house-hold.

Section 2 (q) defines respondent as follows:

2 (q)   respondent means any adult male person who is, or has
been, in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person and
against whom the aggrieved person has sought any relief under this
Act:

Provided that an aggrieved wife or female living in a relationship in
the nature of a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative
of the husband or the male partner
       Domestic violence which is defined in Section 2(g) reads as
under:
2 (g)   domestic violence has the same meaning as assigned to it
in Section 3.

Section 3 of the Act defines domestic violence. The said provision reads
as follows:

        3.      Definition of domestic violence:- For the purposes of this
Act, any act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent
shall constitute domestic violence in case it 
(a)     harms or injuries or endangers the health, safety, life, limb
or well-being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person
or tends to do so and includes causing physical abuse, sexual abuse,
verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or 
        b)      harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person
with a view to coerce her or any other person related to her to
meet any unlawful  demand for dowry or other property or valuable
security; or
        (c)     has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any
person related to her by any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or
clause (b); or
(d)     otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or
mental, to   the aggrieved person.

Thus, Section 3 of the Act also in the introductory part makes a
reference to the word respondent.
5.              (f)     A plain and analytical reading and a harmonious
consideration of all the provisions of the Act, particularly, the above
definitions brings to the fore the following aspects:  A person can be
arraigned as a respondent in a DV case provided he is or has been in a
domestic relationship with the aggrieved person.   The proviso to Section
2(q) says that an aggrieved wife may also file a complaint against the
relation of a husband.  A plain reading of the said definition would make
it manifest that any person who can be arraigned as a respondent must
be a person who is or has been in domestic relationship with the
aggrieved person and must have subjected the aggrieved person to any
act of domestic violence.   Unless the said requirements are fulfilled a
person cannot be arraigned as a respondent in a DV Case.  Coming to the
aspect of domestic relationship, the domestic relationship means a
relationship between two persons who either are living together or had
at any point of time lived together in a shared household when they are
related by consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the
nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a
joint family.  The definition of shared household is already extracted
supra.

5.              (g)     Therefore, in the well-considered view of this Court,
for a person to be made a respondent in a DV case filed by an aggrieved
woman, such respondent, must have a domestic relationship with the 
aggrieved person and must have been living or must have lived together
in a shared household along with the aggrieved person when they are
related by consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the
nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a
joint family.  Therefore, when any person who is so related who has been
not living or had not lived together at any point of time with the
aggrieved person in a shared household and who has/had no domestic  
relationship cannot be made a respondent to a case filed by the woman
under the provisions of the Act.

5.              (h)     To put it in other words, in order to arraign a person
as a respondent in a DV case filed under section 12 of the Act, there
must be a domestic relationship either in present or in the past between
the aggrieved person and the respondent.  In any case, the domestic
relationship must be in existence at the relevant time when aggrieved
person has been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the
respondent.  It is noticeable from the provisions that a domestic
relationship arises between the aggrieved person and another, in case
when either they are living together or have at any point of time lived
together in a shared house hold and when they are related by
consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the nature of
marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint
family.  The aggrieved person and the respondent need not be living
together in a shared household at the time of the filing of the
case/petition and it would be sufficient if they had lived together at any
point of time in the past, when the alleged acts/omissions/conduct
complained of had taken place.

5.              (i)     Coming back to the facts of the case, all the petitioners are
residents of Prakasam District whereas the respondent is a resident of
Hyderabad.  There is nothing on record to show that the present petitioners
had any domestic relationship and lived together with the 2nd respondent in a
shared household at any point of time.  Further after the proceedings in Crime
No.204 of 2010 were quashed by this Court, by orders dated 04.10.2012, the
present DV case is filed by the 2nd respondent.
6.              Viewed thus, this Court finds that the petitioners have made out
valid and sufficient grounds to quash the proceedings against them in
D.V.C.No.18 of 2012 on the file of VI Metropolitan Magistrate, Medchal, Ranga
Reddy District.

7.              Accordingly, the Criminal Petition is allowed. Consequently, the
proceedings against the petitioners herein in D.V.C.No.18 of 2012 on the file of
VI Metropolitan Magistrate, Medchal, Ranga Reddy District are hereby quashed.

      Miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in this criminal petition shall
stand closed.

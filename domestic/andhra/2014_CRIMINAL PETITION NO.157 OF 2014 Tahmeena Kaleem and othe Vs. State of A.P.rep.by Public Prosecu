HONBLE SRI JUSTICE B. CHANDRA KUMAR         

CRIMINAL PETITION NO.157 OF 2014     

O R D E R:- 
        The petitioners  A9 to A12 are seeking anticipatory
bail for the alleged offences punishable under Sections
498-A IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act
read with 34 IPC.
        The de facto complainant  Mrs. Syeda Saba was  
married to Mohammed Bin Issaq  A1 on 05.09.2011.   
She alleges that at the time of her marriage, her father
gave 40 tulas of gold and Rs.10.00 lakhs as dowry.  After
the marriage, her husband and in-laws treated her well
for few days and thereafter started harassing her
demanding to bring additional dowry.  It is also her case
that she visited her parents house but she did not
disclose the harassment meted out by her husband and  
in-laws.  She further alleges that her father-in-law,
mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law insisted
her to take divorce from her husband so that they would
perform second marriage to her husband and get more 
dowry.  She alleges that her husband and the above
referred accused forcibly sent her out of her house in the
month of August, 2013 demanding her to bring Rs.5.00 
lakhs from her parents. According to her, she informed
her father about the demand and her father arranged
Rs.2.00 lakhs.  She again alleges that for some days her
in-laws were happy, but again started harassing her and
this time the parents of her mother-in-law namely Syed
Kaleemulla Hussain and his wife, Bipasha along with
their other relatives, Tahmina Kaleem and Razziuddain
started visiting their house and advised her husband and
in-laws that if she (de facto complainant) is sent out of
their house they would bring a rich girl for her husband.
Again, she alleges that two more sisters of her husband
namely Manal Ishaq, resident of Australia, and Mona
Ishaq, resident of Jeddah encouraged her husband and 
in-laws over phone and they called her on phone and
abused and threatened her with dire consequences if she
fails to oblige them.  She further alleges that her another
sister-in-law  Madiha and her husband  Md. Sharif also
harassed her on petty issues.  She says that she
informed her father who tried to pacify the matter and
she convinced her parents.  She alleges that on
29.10.2013, her husband along with her in-laws and
their relatives held meeting in their house and necked
her from their house demanding to bring Rs.10.00 lakhs
additional dowry.
        
      A perusal of the above complaint would disclose
that petitioner Nos.3 and 4 herein are the parents of the
mother-in-law of the de facto complainant and petitioner
Nos.1 and 2 are the relatives of petitioner Nos.3 and 4.
The petitioners case is that they are innocent and have
been falsely implicated in this case.  The further case of
the
Petitioners 1 and 2  A9 and A10 is that they are no way
connected to A1 or his family members.  The 3rd
petitioner is aged 68 years and 4th petitioner is aged 65
years who are said to be taking regular treatment for
their ill health.

      It is most unfortunate that the de facto
complainant has implicated her in laws, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, parents of the mother-in-law and their
relatives, two more sisters of her husband and their
husbands who are residing in foreign countries.  A
reading of the complaint gives an impression that the de
facto complainant has implicated almost all the relatives
of her husband and their other close relatives who are
visiting her husbands house.  This is most unfortunate
situation.  This type of complaint gives an impression
that Section 498-A is being misused to harass not only
the husband of the de facto complainant but all his
relatives.  It is alleged that in order to force the husband
to come to their terms or in order to meet their huge
demands, this kind of complaints are being given.  How
difficult it would be for those persons staying in
Australia, Jeddah or USA to come over to India and face
the criminal case and prove their innocence.

      Truth or otherwise of the allegations cannot be
decided unless fair and dispassionate investigation is
completed.  Sometimes, after full-fledged trial only, truth
may come out.  There cannot be any doubt to say that 
there is dowry menace in the society.  But, at the same
time, it is also a fact that certain marriages are
performed without any dowry.  Due to ill-advice or under
a wrong impression that if a complaint is lodged under
section 498-A IPC, the husband may come to terms,  
complaints are being lodged with the police.  When
differences arise, there should be proper counselling
before and after marriage.  It is quite natural that
husband and wife would have faced different
circumstances and environment from their childhood
resulting in gaining different impressions and opinions
and therefore they may have difference of opinion on life
style and on several other issues.  Therefore, issues have
to be resolved by trying to understand one another,
particularly, when the parties have children, special care
has to be taken to protect the interest of the children.
The welfare of the children should be given utmost
importance.  Therefore, proper counselling at initial stage
would help the parties.  It is most unfortunate that
Section 498-A IPC has become a weapon in breaking the  
families rather than in uniting them.
      In case between Preeti Gupta v. State of
Jharkhand , the Apex Court observed as follows.
      It is a matter of common experience that
most of these complaints under section 498-A IPC 
are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial
issues without proper deliberations. We come
across a large number of such complaints which 
are not even bona fide and are filed with oblique
motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the
number of genuine cases of dowry harassment  
are also a matter of serious concern.
      The learned members of the Bar have
enormous social responsibility and obligation to
ensure that the social fiber of family life is not
ruined or demolished. They must ensure that
exaggerated versions of small incidents should
not be reflected in the criminal complaints.
Majority of the complaints are filed either on their
advice or with their concurrence. The learned
members of the Bar who belong to a noble 
profession must maintain its noble traditions and
should treat every complaint under section 498-A
as a basic human problem and must make   
serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving
at an amicable resolution of that human problem.
They must discharge their duties to the best of
their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace
and tranquility of the society remains intact. The
members of the Bar should also ensure that one
complaint should not lead to multiple cases.
      Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the
complaint the implications and consequences are 
not properly visualized by the complainant that
such complaint can lead to insurmountable
harassment, agony and pain to the complainant, 
accused and his close relations.
      The ultimate object of justice is to find out
the truth and punish the guilty and protect the
innocent. To find out the truth is a Herculean
task in majority of these complaints. The
tendency of implicating husband and all his
immediate relations is also not uncommon. At
times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial,
it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The
courts have to be extremely careful and cautious
in dealing with these complaints and must take
pragmatic realities into consideration while
dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of
harassment of husband's close relations who had
been living in different cities and never visited or
rarely visited the place where the complainant
resided would have an entirely different
complexion. The allegations of the complaint are
required to be scrutinized with great care and
circumspection.
      Experience reveals that long and protracted
criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and
bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties.
It is also a matter of common knowledge that in
cases filed by the complainant if the husband or
the husband's relations had to remain in jail even
for a few days, it would ruin the chances of
amicable settlement altogether. The process of
suffering is extremely long and painful.
      Before parting with this case, we would like
to observe that a serious relook of the entire
provision is warranted by the legislature. It is also
a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated  
versions of the incident are reflected in a large
number of complaints. The tendency of over
implication is also reflected in a very large
number of cases.  The criminal trials lead to
immense sufferings for all concerned. Even
ultimate acquittal in the trial may also not be able
to wipe out the deep scars of suffering of
ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these
complaints have not only flooded the courts but
also have led to enormous social unrest affecting
peace, harmony and happiness of the 
society       

      In Kans Raj v. State of Punjab , the Apex Court
observed as follows.
      A tendency has, however, developed for
roping in all relations of the in-laws of the deceased
wives in the matters of dowry deaths which, if not
discouraged, is likely to affect the case of the
prosecution even against the real culprits.  In their
over enthusiasm and anxiety to seek conviction for
maximum people, the parents of the deceased have  
been found to be making efforts for involving other
relations which ultimately weaken the case of the
prosecution even against the real accused.

      In Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India , the
Apex Court observed as follows.
      The object of the provision is prevention of
the dowry menace.  But as has been rightly
contended by the petitioner many instances have
come to light where the complaints are not bona
fide and have been filed with oblique motive.  In
such cases acquittal of the accused does not in all
cases wipe out the ignomy suffered during and
prior to trial.  Sometimes adverse media coverage
adds to the misery.  The question, therefore, is
what remedial measures can be taken to prevent 
abuse of the well-intentioned provision.

      In the case between K.Srinivas Rao Vs.
D.A.Deepa , the Apex Court observed as follows:-
      Quite often, the cause of the
misunderstanding in a matrimonial dispute is
trivial and can be sorted. Mediation as a method of
alternative dispute resolution has got legal
recognition now. We have referred several
matrimonial disputes to mediation centres. Our
experience shows that about 10 to 15% of 
matrimonial disputes get settled in this Court
through various mediation centres. We, therefore,
feel that at the earliest stage i.e. when the dispute
is taken up by the Family Court or by the court of
first instance for hearing, it must be referred to
mediation centres. Matrimonial disputes
particularly those relating to custody of child,
maintenance, etc. are pre-eminently fit for
mediation. Section 9 of the Family Courts Act
enjoins upon the Family Court to make efforts to
settle the matrimonial disputes and in these
efforts, Family Courts are assisted by Counsellors.
Even if the Counsellors fail in their efforts, the
Family Courts should direct the parties to
mediation centres, where trained mediators are
appointed to mediate between the parties. Being
trained in the skill of mediation, they produce good
results.
      The idea of pre-litigation mediation is also
catching up. Some mediation centres have, after
giving wide publicity, set up Help Desks at
prominent places including facilitation centres at
court complexes to conduct pre-litigation
mediation. We are informed that in Delhi
Government Mediation and Conciliation Centres,
and in Delhi High Court Mediation Centre, several
matrimonial disputes are settled. These centres
have a good success rate in pre-litigation
mediation. If all mediation centres set up pre-
litigation desks/clinics by giving sufficient
publicity and matrimonial disputes are taken up
for pre-litigation settlement, many families will be
saved of hardship if, at least, some of them are
settled.
      We recognize mediation as an effective
method of alternative dispute resolution in
matrimonial matters and that is the reason why
we want the parties to explore the possibility of
settlement through mediation in matrimonial
disputes.
      We, therefore, issue directions, which the
courts dealing with the matrimonial matters shall
follow:
      a) In terms of Section 9 of the Family Courts
Act, the Family Courts shall make all efforts to
settle the matrimonial disputes through mediation.
Even if the Counsellors submit a failure report, the
Family Courts shall, with the consent of the
parties, refer the matter to the mediation centre. In
such a case, however, the Family Courts shall set
a reasonable time limit for mediation centres to
complete the process of mediation because 
otherwise the resolution of the disputes by the
Family Court may get delayed. In a given case, if
there is good chance of settlement, the Family
Court in its discretion, can always extend the time
limit.
      b) The criminal courts dealing with the
complaint under Section 498-A of the IPC should,
at any stage and particularly, before they take up
the complaint for hearing, refer the parties to
mediation centre if they feel that there exist
elements of settlement and both the parties are
willing. However, they should take care to see that
in this exercise, rigour, purport and efficacy of
Section 498-A of the IPC is not diluted. Needless to
say that the discretion to grant or not to grant bail
is not in any way curtailed by this direction. It will
be for the concerned court to work out the
modalities taking into consideration the facts of
each case. 
      c) All mediation centres shall set up pre-
litigation desks/clinics; give them wide publicity
and make efforts to settle matrimonial disputes at
pre-litigation stage.

      In similar circumstances, Honble Mr. Justice R.
Regupathi of Madras High Court, in his order dated
04.08.2008, passed in M.P.No.1 of 2008 in
Crl.O.P.No.10896 of 2008, has observed as follows.

        It must be borne in mind that the object
behind the enactment of Section 498-A IPC and 
the Dowry Prohibition Act is to check and curb
the menace of dowry and at the same time, to
save the matrimonial homes from destruction.
Our experience shows that, apart from the
husband, all family members are implicated and
dragged to the police stations.  Though arrest of
those persons is not at all necessary, in a number
of cases, such harassment is made simply to 
satisfy the ego and anger of the complainant.  By
suitably dealing with such matters, the injury to
innocents could be avoided to a considerable
extent by the Magistrates, but, if the Magistrates
themselves accede to the bare requests of the
police without examining the actual state of
affairs, it would create negative effects thereby,
the very purpose of the legislation would be
defeated and the doors of conciliation would be
closed forever.  The husband and his family
members may have difference of opinion in the
dispute, for which, arrest and judicial remand are
not the answers.  The ultimate object of every
legal system is to punish the guilty and protect
the innocents.
        

      With similar observations certain guidelines have
been issued by Madras High Court. 

      I have also perused the judgement of the Delhi High
Court passed in Bail application No.1627 of 2008, dated
04.08.2008, by His Lordship Justice Kailash Gambhir
and also the judgment dated 30.09.2011 passed in 
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.3322 of 2010 by the
Allahabad High Court.

      It appears that there is every need to give similar
directions in Andhra Pradesh.  Under Domestic Violence
Act, protection officer is required to assist the police and
the Court.  Section 14 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005 envisages that the
Magistrate may, at any stage of the proceedings under
this Act, direct the respondents or the aggrieved person
either singly or jointly to undergo counselling with any
member of a service provider who posses such 
qualification and experience in counselling as may be
prescribed.  Section 498-A IPC is a cognizable and non-
compoundable offence.   

      In the light of the above discussion, the following
guidelines have been issued.

a)      A fair and dispassionate investigation should be
conducted.  After completing investigation, the
same should be verified by an officer not below
the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.

b)      During the course of investigation, if the
investigating officer is satisfied that there is false
implication of any person in the complaint then
he may delete the names of such persons from 
the charge sheet after obtaining necessary
permission from the Superintendent of Police or
any other officer equivalent to that rank.

c)      As soon as a complaint is received either from
the wife alleging dowry harassment or from the
husband that there is every likelihood of him
being implicated in a case of dowry harassment,
then, both the parties should be asked to
undergo counselling with any experienced
counsellor or counsellors.  The report of such
counsellors should be made as a part of the
report to be submitted by the investigating
officer to the Court.

d)      The Superintendent of Police, in consultation
with the Chairman, District Legal Services
Authority, may prepare a panel of counsellors
and such panel of counsellors along with their
address and phone numbers should be made   
available at all the police stations.

e)      Normally, no accused should be arrested, where 
the allegation is simple dowry harassment.  If
the arrest is necessary during the course of
investigation, the investigating officer should
obtain permission of the Superintendent of
Police or any other officer of the equal rank in
metropolitan cities.  If arrest is not necessary,
the police may complete the investigation and
lay charge sheet before the Court without
arresting the accused and seek necessary orders 
from the Court.  However, in the case of dowry
death, suspicious death, suicide or where the
allegations are serious in nature such as
inflicting of bodily injury etc., the police officer
may arrest the accused.  However, the
intimation of such arrest should be immediately
sent to the concerned Superintendent of Police
who may give necessary guidance to the 
arresting officer.

f)      No accused or witness should be unnecessarily 
called to the police station and as soon as the
purpose of summoning them to the police station
is over they should be sent back.  There should
not be any unnecessary harassment to any  
person i.e. either to the relatives of the de facto
complainant or to the relatives of the husband.

g)      The higher police officers should see that the
parties do not make any allegations that they are
forced to come to any settlement in police
stations against their wish.  However, this does
not mean that the police officers should not
make any effort for amicable settlement.

h)      The advocates have to play their role in trying to
unite the families.  They must act as social
reformers while dealing with these kind of cases,
particularly, where the couple have children.
Even when an accused is produced before the 
Magistrate, they should examine the matter
judiciously and consider whether there are valid
grounds for remanding the accused to the
judicial custody.  No accused should be
remanded to judicial custody mechanically in
routine manner.  If the Magistrate feels that the
accused cannot be released after taking bonds,
necessary orders may be passed accordingly.  

   The Director General of Police, Andhra Pradesh, is
requested to issue necessary instructions to all the
concerned in this regard.

      In the instant case, having regard to the allegations
made against the petitioners and in the facts and
circumstances of the case, I am inclined to grant
anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

      In the event of arrest of the petitioners, they shall
be enlarged on bail on their executing a bond for a sum
of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand Only) each with
one surety for a like sum each to the satisfaction of the
arresting officer, Falaknuma Police Station, Hyderabad.

      Accordingly, the Criminal Petition is allowed.

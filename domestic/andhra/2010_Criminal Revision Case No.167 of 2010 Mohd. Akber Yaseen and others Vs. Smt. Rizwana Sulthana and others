:ORDER:  

1.      This revision petition is filed by the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in
D.V.C.No.1 of 2010 on the file of VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate
Court, Hyderabad, which was filed by the respondent Nos.1 to 5 herein, under the
Protection Of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (in short, 'the Act'), for
certain reliefs. Peculiarly, this revision petition is filed against issuing of
notices to petitioner Nos.1 to 4 herein in D.V.C.No.1 of 2010. When questioned
as to maintainability of this revision petition against issuing of notice, the
petitioners' counsel submitted that it is well settled principle of law that
revision petition lies under Section 397 Cr.P.C. as against an order of issuing
summons to the accused under section 204 Cr.P.C. Section 204 Cr.P.C. deals with  
taking cognizance of offence in the complaint filed by the complainant and
thereafter issuing either summons or warrants against the accused persons.
Taking cognizance of an offence and issuing summons in a criminal case is
certainly a judicial act, and the Magistrate while performing the said judicial
act, has to apply his/her mind on the material placed before the Magistrate and
then only take cognizance of the offence, in case ingredients for that
particular offence are made out and thereafter order issue summons to the
accused. Since issuing of summons under section 204 Cr.P.C. involves exercise of
judicial mind and passing a judicial order, issuing of summons thereunder is
construed as an order which is revisable under Section 397 Cr.P.C. But, in the
case of Domestic Violence cases filed for releifs under Sections 18 to 23 of the
Act, there is no element of criminality involved, much less the domestic
violence case is a criminal case as such. Unless the case is filed alleging
offences under Sections 31 and 33 of the Act, the entire proceedings in a
domestic violence case are purely civil in nature, but entertained by criminal
Courts applying procedure enunciated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
Therefore, while issuing notice in domestic violence case filed by respondent
Nos.1 to 5, the Magistrate is not expected to apply or exercise his/her mind
before issuing notices to the respondents therein. No summonses are issued in a
domestic violence case, but only notices are issued. Issuing notices to the
respondents in a domestic violence case, in my considered opinion, is not a
judicial act but is only a Ministerial act performed by the Magistrate. As
against a Ministerial Act, no revision is maintainable under Section 397 Cr.P.C.

2. Assuming for a moment for the sake of argument that issuing of notice in a
domestic violence case amounts to an order passed by the Magistrate and further
a judicial order passed by the Magistrate, even then the revision petition under
Section 397 is not maintainable, because any order passed by the Magistrate is
appellable under Section 29 of the Act. The petitioners cannot bypass remedy of
appeal and approach directly this Court under Section 397 Cr.P.C. by way of this
revision petition.
3.      Thus, viewed from any angle, this revision petition is not maintainable in
this Court.

4.      In the result, the Criminal Revision Petition is dismissed.

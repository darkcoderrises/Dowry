HONBLE SRI JUSTICE R. SUBHASH REDDY         

AND  

HONBLE SRI JUSTICE A. SHANKAR NARAYANA           

F.C.A. Nos.16 AND 22 OF 2007   

COMMON  JUDGMENT: (Per Honble Sri Justice A. Shankar Narayana)      


        Both these appeals arise out of a common order, dated
30-11-2006, in O.P. Nos.602 of 2003 and 369 of 2005, passed by the
Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge for the trial of Jubilee Hills
Car Bomb Blast Case  cum  Additional Family Court  cum   
XXIII Additional Chief Judge, Red Hills, Nampally, Hyderabad (for
short the Family Court).

     2.  Former O.P. is filed by the husband seeking dissolution of
marriage by grant of decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty
under Section 13 (1) (i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (for short
the Act), but he was unsuccessful.  Latter O.P. is filed by the wife
seeking decree for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the
Act and she became successful.  Aggrieved of the same, the husband  
preferred both these appeal.

        3.  We intend to refer to the relevant facts for the purpose of
disposal of both these appeals.

        a)  The marriage between the appellant  husband and the
respondent  wife was solemnized on 24-10-1999 in a local function
hall at Hyderabad as per Hindu rites and customs.  It was an arranged
marriage.  The proposal was initiated and mediated by one
Mr. P.V. Kutumba Rao, a close relative of the father of appellant.
The appellant gave consent agreeing to the proposal in the month of
July, 1999 to marry the respondent.
        
        b)  During the period of settlement of marriage alliance,
the respondents father revealed to the parents of the appellant that her
earlier alliance was broken due to bad character of the bride-groom.
Despite the same, the appellant developed a soft-corner towards the
respondent and decided to proceed for marriage.  Since he was posted
at Botswana at the time of engagement ceremony that took place on 
29-08-1999, the engagement ceremony was performed in his absence,   
thus, the usual formalities were observed and the marriage had taken
place after his return from Botswana in the second week of October,
1999.

        c)  The appellant states that right from the beginning, the
respondent exhibited crude behaviour, adamant attitude, arrogance
and the cumulative effect of the same led to his mental torture and
agony.  Since the alleged acts, constituting cruelty, have been
narrated as many as in (116) paragraphs, we intend to summarize
them as points, which are as under:

        i)  The respondent asked the appellant to give his money and
transfer his property to her which shocked him;
        ii)  For the Diwali festival that fallen on 07-11-1999, on an
invitation from the appellants parents-in-law, they left to his parents-
in-laws house, but the respondent did not even inform his parents,
and on the other hand, she picked up an argument spoiling his festive
mood accusing him that he was responsible for forcing wasteful
expenditure on the respondents parents during marriage.

        iii)  When they visited Vijayawada on 11-11-1999 to attend the
marriage of respondents brother, since his father intended to visit an
Ashram near Vijayawada located about 60 KMs. away and seek    
blessings of a Guruji, his father when informed his father-in-law,
a Jeep was arranged by his father-in-law, but the respondent
reluctantly got into the Jeep as she was not willing to have the
blessings of the Guruji, and when his parents got down at Benz Circle,
she hurled abusive phrases against his parents accusing him that he
did not deserve to be married and that he should have taken Sanyas.

        iv)  On 23-12-1999, when his parents went to Saibaba Tample
at BHEL, Ramachandrapuram on Datta Jayanthi Celebrations at   
7.00 P.M., he expressed his intention to wait till his parents return, to
take dinner with them, but she got wild and slept in the bed-room.

        v)  On 25-12-1999, when his parents asked him to take them to
his sisters house at Motinagar in Hyderabad, he requested the
respondent to join them, but she refused and did not take dinner on
that night and break-fast on 26-12-1999 and without informing him
she got arranged a car through her parents and at 10.00 A.M., she left
them without informing his parents even, locking the bed room and
taking away the keys with her.

        vi)  In December, 1999, when they visited the house of one
Mr. Subhash, a friend of the appellant, for dinner, he (Mr. Subhash)
had shown some of his honeymoon photographs to them and, after  
they returned home, she has ridiculed him and abused for not taking
her to honeymoon trip.  He explained her that they can have a nice
time as they would be going to United States of America (USA) soon,
but she degraded his status by saying that Mr. Subhash is a better
person when compared to him.  

        vii)  In December, 2000, his mother-in-law invited her daughter
(respondent) to attend a fare-well party of a friend of his father-in-law,
who retired on that day, but he returned at 8.00 P.M. from his office,
and since it takes one hours journey to reach the party venue and also
he was not invited, he refused to take her, on which, she shouted at
him and did not take dinner in protest.

        viii)  During January and February, 2000, before proceeding to
USA, the appellant intended to visit Shirdi and his relatives places,
which he has expressed during general discussions, but since the
respondent did not express any interest, he purchased tickets for
himself only, and the said fact when learnt by her, she questioned him,
on which, he told her that it was too late and that he would buy tickets
for her also, but she shouted at him stating that she would have come
had he originally bought the tickets for her also and, thus, she did not
like to come.

        ix)  In January, 2000, when the wife of respondents brother left
her brother, she informed the appellant about bad character of her
sister-in-law, but he ignored it.  But, during April, 2000, one of his
relatives told his parents that they (his parents) were not treating the
respondent properly and not allowing the appellant to spend time with
her, on which, they got upset and stopped speaking to the respondent.
He also felt bad and reduced his interactions with the respondent.

        x)  When the appellant had to make trip to Kuwait, he did not
inform the respondent about it and started packing for the trip in
April, 2000, since none of them were talking to her, she became
anxious and asked him that they were not talking to her, on which,
when he revealed the reason, she got wild and shouted at him and
commented at his parents.  She has also abused him for not informing
about his trip to Kuwait and reminded that in earlier discussions when
he informed her that his Company would be sending him to Middle 
East Asia, she used to tell him that she did not like to travel to Middle
East Asia and that is why, he was making the trip alone.
Having heard the said shouts as it was a small neighbour-hood, even
the neighbours came out of the houses to see what was happening in 
their house, thus, he was deeply hurt and embarrassed and left for
Kuwait.
        xi)  For her birthday, when the appellant called her on
20-04-2000, to greet her, she started abusing him, because of
non-intimation of Flight schedule and not calling her immediately
after reaching the Kuwait, though, he thought that she would
apologise for the incidents that took place, instead, she shouted at him
and, therefore, according to him, she was very adamant and
unpleasant in her behaviour and he decided not to talk to her and did
not call her until he returned to India on 1st July, 2000 for a break of
two weeks. 

        xii)  When the appellant took the respondent to Ramoji Film
City for a holiday trip, since there was separation for two and half
months between them, and that could bring some positive change in 
her behaviour, still, she started shouting at him and abusing him,
commenting at her parents that they were creating differences
between them and responsible for all the problems, on which, he
warned her not to speak a word against his parents saying that his
parents were more sympathetic towards her. 

        xiii)  On 10-07-2000, four days before his departure to Kuwait,
he met with an accident and had some stitches on his leg and he was
advised to take two weeks bed rest, during which time, the respondent
was staying at her parents house and she came to see only once, and
that instead of sympathizing with him, she told that God had punished
him for not taking her along with him to Kuwait.

        xiv)  On 27-07-2000, when he called the respondent and gave
his departure schedule, she did not turn up at the Air-port to see him
off.

        xv)  On 24-08-2000, though, he gave his arrival schedule, the
respondent did not come to receive him.  The appellant also states that
they called the mediator, Mr. Kutumba Rao, and his father-in-law and
when they were informed about the incidents that took place at his
house, his father-in-law got shocked and promised that he would
censure his daughter and bring her to his (appellant) house.  Next day,
when he (father-in-law) brought the respondent, and when he
(appellant) asked him whether he has censured his daughter, to his
surprise, he shouted back at him saying that he should not have
married his daughter if he did not know how to take care of her, and if
he did not like her, he could have left her and she could have lived her
life independently, on which, they were shocked and he decided to go
to USA alone without the respondent.  Later, discussions went on
among themselves and late in that night, his father-in-law told him
that parents would be happy only if the children are happy and asked
them to forget all the past issues and start a fresh life in USA.  He also
states that they left for USA on 09-09-2000 and for one year they
lived happily and he took the respondent to the tourists places, such as
Disney Land, Niagara Falls and lot of visits to Temples etc.

        xvi)  He states that during February, 2001, his parents informed
him that his sister was pregnant, but the respondent did not react
positively when the good news was conveyed to her, and on the other
hand, expressed that his parents and his sister should have informed
her about the good news.  Thus, she developed wanton animosity 
against his sister.

        xvii)  In between January and June, 2001, one of his friends,
Mr. Srinivas, an extrovert, used to be very friendly and close with all
the Non-Indian Families in Stamford and, during parties and
get-togethers, he used to crack jokes and make fun of couples by
making general comments, such as Mrs. X is angry now, and so Mr. X  
is not getting any food today.  Similarly, he cracked jokes against the
appellant and respondent.  The respondent took advantage of the said
comments and accused the appellant saying that he was discussing his  
personal problems with his friends and continued a negative attitude.
A year later, when her mother had come to their house in USA, she
raised the same issues several times and derided and debased him by 
telling her mother that he was a characterless person and that he had
no shame in discussing personal issues with his friends.

        xviii)  Certain similar issues were also mentioned in paragraph
Nos.27 and 28 of the petition.

        xix)  In the last week of November, 2001, he made a telephonic
call to his parents and before ending the call, he asked his mother as to
whether she would like to speak with the respondent, but her mother
refused to speak with the respondent.  When the same was noticed by 
the respondent, she increased her animosity towards his parents and
started making sarcastic comments against them.  She had also  
derided her in-laws for not inviting her parents to the 21st day
ceremony of his sisters son.  He tried to persuade her stating that it
may take some time to reconcile the differences between the two
families and re-build the relationship, but she ridiculed him shouting
against her in-laws.  When he asked his mother as to why she refused
to speak with respondent, she (his mother) then reminded him as to
how the respondent had shouted at her and abused her in full view of
the neighbours and asked him how she could speak to the respondent  
when she did not respect them.

        xx)  In the first week of December, 2001, the respondent
commented that it was the responsibility of the appellant and his
parents to take care of her, but his parents have not sent anything and
that she was ashamed of accepting jewellery from her parents.  In the
first week of January, 2002, they visited New York City to see some
of his family friends, Mr. and Mrs. Venkateswara Rao, and from their
house, they went to the house of Mr. and Mrs. M.S. Rao and their
daughters family.  Mr. and Mrs. M.S. Rao have just returned from
India along with their daughter, son-in-law and grand-daughter.
When they visited his parents in India, they recorded them on their
camcorder and also recorded his sister and sisters son and it was
played on the Television during their visit.  He was excited to see his
parents, his sister and her newly born son, but the respondent did not
see the recording and stayed away in another room; though, all of
them called her to see the recording, she adamantly stayed away in
another room and openly disregarded her parents in front of them.

        xxi)  The appellant took the respondent to a general medical
practitioner, Dr. Shanti Devaraj and two gynaecologists, Dr. Julia
Gray and Dr. Francis Ginsberg, as the respondent did not get her
periods regularly between the months of April and October, 2001.
They also visited Stamford Hospital in August, 2001 on the
recommendation of Dr. Shanti Devaraj to get an ultrasound scan of
respondents uterus.  The report showed the presence of poly-ovarian
cyst. The Gynaecologists told them that the cysts are a general
phenomenon and melt away on their own, but only in some cases they  
are cancerous.  After the respondent had her period in October, 2001,
Dr. Julia Gray did tissue culture on 02-11-2001 and told them that it
was not cancerous.  Dr. Francis Ginsberg did an ultrasound scan on
07-11-2001 and told them that there was no trace of cyst after the
period and told the respondent that her cycles would become normal
again, but as more than eight weeks elapsed since her last period in
October, 2001, she became suspicious to take an appointment with 
Dr. Julia Gray.  Since Dr. Julia Gray was on vacation in December,
2001, they could get appointment only in the first week of January,
2002.  Dr. Julia Gray did a pregnancy test on the respondent in the
first week of January, 2002 and told them that the test came out with
negative result.  She prescribed a five-day course of medroxy-
progeterone (provera) pills to induce periods in her.  He was against
the usage of pills and asked her to wait till it happens naturally, but
she did not listen and took those pills from 13-01-2002 to 17-01-2002,
but there was no effect till 27-01-2002, so they approached Dr. Julia
Gray, who told them that she could not think of anything and asked
them to contact Dr. Francis Ginsberg.  When they called Dr. Francis
Ginsberg on 28-01-2002, she asked the respondent to take a 
pregnancy test and call her back with the result of pregnancy test.  The
respondent had undergone pregnancy test on the morning of 29-01- 
2002, and the test came out positive.  The respondent started crying
and thought that the pills might have affected the embryo and was
worried about the condition of the embryo. She immediately called
her mother and narrated everything, and his mother-in-law told the
respondent that he might have bribed Dr. Julia Gray and might have
influenced the doctor to give a wrong prescription to affect the
respondents health and pregnancy, on which, he was shocked, as the 
respondent also began to accept her mothers notion that he might
have influenced Dr. Julia Gray in giving her a wrong prescription.
When both of them were worried about the embryos condition, his
mother-in-law accused him of trying to prevent the pregnancy by
influencing the doctor to give a wrong prescription, the respondent
asked him to take legal action against Dr. Julia Gray, but he asked his
wife to wait till they get medical reports about the condition of the
embryo and told her that he would take legal action if the medical
reports indicate the damage about the embryo due to the pills.
The subsequent tests and ultrasound scan indicated a normal condition
of the baby and no abnormalities were discovered.  Despite the same,
she went on persuading him to take legal action against Dr. Julia
Gray.  He told her that firstly, no damage could be established due to
the pills, secondly, there was a 0.3% scope for failure of the
pregnancy test conducted by Dr. Julia Gray, and thirdly, they were
new to USA and have very little savings and they would not be able to
bear any adverse outcome of the legal action, but she was not
convinced.

         xxii) Since he did not show any interest and tried to evade the
respondent, she then started making statements that her mother was 
right in accusing him of conspiring with the doctor to effect the
respondent and their baby and she even made comparisons between   
him and others stating that any other person, in his situation, would
have definitely taken legal action against the doctor, and that he was
feared of taking legal action, but he feared that he might be indicted in
bribing the doctors.  He was deeply hurt and he was not allowed to be
happy about the new addition to his life and since he wanted the
respondent to be peaceful and happy to facilitate healthy growth of
baby, he did not want to argue and silently tolerated the insults.
The appellant states that he was working for Satyam Computer 
Services in USA at the client location of General Electric Capital
Services, and since his contract with the client was due to expire on
31-03-2002, the Client Manager asked him in February, 2002 to look
for other opportunities by telling him that there would not be any
extension of contract beyond 30-04-2002, and he immediately
informed his reporting Manager in Satyam about it and asked him to
consider for new requirements and the reporting manager assured him
that he would start looking for new opportunities but cautioned him
that the chances of finding new opportunities were very bleak.  Since
he did not get any new opportunities in the following few weeks, he
told the respondent in the second week of March, 2002, that his
contract would be ending on 30-04-2002 and they may have to 
relocate to India in the first week of May, 2002, on which, she
immediately wrote on a piece of paper that he wanted to kill her baby
on which, he was devastated and could not express the pain that he
felt when he read the paper.  He tried his best to convince her, but she
was not in a position to listen to him, thus, the relationship between
them was strained.

            xxiii)  In the third week of April, 2002, both of them
approached Dr. Irene Komaransky, a Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, who 
did a detailed ultrasound scan of respondents womb and showed 
them various parts of the babys body on a monitor and explained
about the growth and development of the baby and gave them 
measurements of babys limbs, head etc.  He was excited and after
returning home, he called his parents and started telling them about
the ultrasound scan, and while he was talking to them, the respondent
banged the doors and left the home angrily, on which, he felt dejected
and disappointed at her behaviour.  He completed the call and waited
for his wifes return to home, and after she returned home, when he
asked about her behaviour, she abused him for explaining the details
of ultrasound scan to his parents and shouted at him that he should
never tell anything about the baby to his parents, though he told her
that they were all part of the family and it was their responsibility to
share the good news with parents and making them happy, she  
shouted that she does not belong to the family and that his parents did
not have any right to know about her and the baby, as they have not
called and spoken to her after she became pregnant. He was upset and 
dejected, but he did not want to prolong the discussion, he left to his
office.

        xxiv)  As per recommended precautions, he bought a bath-mat 
for usage in the bath tub to prevent slipping in the bath tub, the
respondent asked him not to lay the bath-mat as dirt might get
accumulated in the grooves, making it difficult to clean the bath-mat,
on which, he packed the bath mat and kept it in a closet. In May,
2002, the respondent asked him to clean the bath room, as some small 
soap pieces got stuck on a corner of the bath tub, when he told that he
would clean bath room, but he could not clean it in the following few
days, as he was busy at his office, she called him at his office and told
that she slipped and almost fell in the bath room, he immediately took
an appointment with the doctors and rushed to him and took her to the
doctor.  On scanning, the doctor told them that there was nothing to be
concerned about, but after returning home, she accused him that he
had purposefully planned to kill baby by sticking soap pieces on the
bath tub, and that he had purposefully avoided cleaning the bath tub.
He tried to remind her that they had been using the bath room for
around two years and that on many previous occasions when the soap  
became very thin, it used to break into pieces and fall down in the tub
and on all those occasions, most of the small soap pieces got washed
away, but one or two pieces stuck to the bath tub.  He told her that
same thing had happened now and then and it was his mistake in not 
cleaning the tub and immediately cleaned the tub.  She raised these
issues several times and hurt him by saying that he had planned to kill
the baby by purposefully sticking the soap pieces on the bath tub and
raised the said issue even in her mothers presence in September,
2002, October, 2002 and November, 2002.  He even told the 
Obstetrician/Gynaecologist Dr.Irene Komaransky in October, 2002 
that he had purposefully stuck the soap pieces in the bath tub, and
when he told the doctor that he had purchased the bath mat to prevent
his wife from slipping, and that his wife only did not want to use the
bath mat, she lied to the doctor saying that he had never bought any
mat and that he was lying.  He was devastated and could not
understand as to why the respondent was lying and trying to project a
negative picture on him. The doctor having understood that they were
not getting along, asked them to consult and take counselling from a
family psychiatrist.

        xxv)  The appellant states that in June, 2002, he was shocked
and annoyed when he saw his wifes maiden name on the book   
instead of his surname and states that she wanted to disassociate
herself and the baby from him.

        xxvi)  The appellant refers to such instances mostly touching
manifestation of differences in their domestic life attributing
something or other to her in the direction of such acts constituting
cruelty.

        xxvii)  The appellant alleges that after delivering a baby on
02-09-2002, the respondent told the doctor and the hospital staff in the
operation theatre that her daughters name would be Udayasri for
which he was shocked as she never mentioned that name to him  
before.

        xxviii)  On the 5th day after delivery i.e., 06-09-2002 (Friday),
his wife was discharged from the hospital along with baby.  On the
after-noon of 7th September, 2002 at around 3.00 P.M, the respondent
having noticed blood in the babys mouth, immediately started
shouting at him attributing that he had cut the babys tongue on which
he was shocked and dumbfounded, and, though, he expected that his  
mother-in-law to intervene and pacify the respondent, but she did not
intervene.  Later, the on-call doctor explained that the blood could
have resulted from any of the two causes:

i)      Presence of some residual blood in the baby, from the
mothers womb. This happens when blood is not 
completely sucked from the babys mouth during the 
delivery process.

ii)     In most cases, nipples crack during the feeding process
and babies suck blood from these cracks and spit out
later.

And that issue was consistently raised by the respondent during the
moths of September, October, November and December, 2002 which    
hurt him.

        xxix)  The appellant states that he had purchased a Video
Camera to record his baby and since the baby was sleeping for most
of the time in the hospital, he used to wait patiently for the baby to
open eyes and then record her, and on the date of discharge from the
hospital, first he recorded the hospital room in which they stayed, and
while they were approaching the Car, he recorded the baby along with
the nurse who was holding their baby on which, the respondent and
his mother-in-law insulted and abused him on at least ten occasions
during the months of September to December, 2002 and January,  
2003 for recording the nurse.
        
        xxx)  He states that he did not like the babys given name and
wanted to give his baby a pet name of Geetha and whenever he
began calling Geetha in September, 2002, the respondent and his
mother-in-law used to laugh loudly and ridicule the name by saying
Geetha, Peetha and Pitchi Geetha.

        xxxi)  The appellant alleges that after the delivery he took the
respondent to Gynaecologist for two post-natal visits, and during the
first visit (around 15th October, 2002), he also accompanied the
respondent into the doctors consulting room.  As the respondent was
weak, the doctor did some tests and told her that physically her body
was normal and asked her if she was having any mental depression, 
on which, the respondent replied that she was having mental
depression because of him, and that he was not feeding her properly
and not taking proper care of her and the baby, on which he was
shocked and explained the doctor, that these were just illusions
coming out of the respondents negative thinking and attitude.  The
appellant states that he explained to the doctor about how the
respondent accused him of cutting his babys tongue and how she 
accused him of bribing a doctor to give the respondent a wrong
medicine and how the respondent refused to use a bath room mat that 
he bought for her protection during pregnancy.  The Gynaecologist
advised them to visit and take counselling from a family Psychiatrist
and gave them the contact numbers of an Indian Psychiatrist, and after
returning home, he called the psychiatrist for an appointment and
informed the respondent about it, on which, she shouted at him saying
that she did not have any mental problems and that she would not visit
any psychiatrist and also shouted at him saying that he alone had
mental problems and he alone should go and visit psychiatrist, which
resulted in cancelling the appointment.  Thereafter, he referred to
certain other instances which are not that significant to advert to
herein.

        xxxii)  After referring to sundry domestic disputes, he alleges
that he took a leave of 10 working days to drop his mother-in-law in
India and arrived at Hyderabad on 26-02-2003, but neither his mother-
in-law nor his father-in-law had the courtesy of thinking him for
coming all the way from USA to drop his mother-in-law and, though,
he stayed in India till 08-03-2003, they did not even call him during
his nine days stay in India, nor did they invite him to their house.

        xxxiii)  The appellant alleges that on the night of 17-03-2003
(Sunday), he was watching Television in living room and his wife was
playing with the baby in the bed room and after playing for some
time, she left the baby on the bed and went to the bath room, during
which time, the baby suddenly rolled over from the bed and fell on the
carpet and started crying, on which he rushed from the living room to
pick up the baby and the respondent also rushed from the bath room
and picked up the baby and started shouting at him that he was
responsible for the babys fall by not taking a bigger home and that he
should have stayed back in India and not returned to USA, and even
she did not like him to touch the baby and continued to abuse him.
He also states that she picked a baby bouncer seat to throw at him and
he rushed towards her to stop her from throwing the bouncer but she
swung the bouncer at him.  He also tried to hold the baby bouncer and
stop her, but her hand struck his neck and her bangles broke resulting
in a small scratch on his neck.  He states that the respondent locked
herself in the bed room along with the baby and shouted that she was
a widow and her husband died and the baby has no father and she 
repeated these words at least ten times.  He also states that when he
landed in India, his wife removed her Mangalsutra and dressed like a
widow. 

        xxxiv)  In paragraph 102, he referred to comments alleged to
have made at him by the respondent. 

        xxxv)  The appellant states that during April and May, 2003,
whenever his friends came to his house or whenever the respondent
made or received any telephone calls from his friends, she used to tell
the friends that he (appellant) had no regard for her and her babys
health and that he had purposefully planned to take her and the baby
back to India to cause health problems to them.

        xxxvi)  The appellant then referred to the acts of the respondent
in not allowing him to take the baby and, thus, she hurt him.

        xxxvii)  The appellant alleges that they left USA on 31-05-2003
and reached Hyderabad on 02-06-2003.  His parents and the family
friends have come to the Airport to receive them.  His father-in-law
and brother-in-law also came to the Air-port.  When they (appellant
and respondent) stepped out of the Airport, his parents invited the
respondent to come to their house, on which, she said that she spent
three years without seeing her mother and would like to go to her
fathers house to see her mother first.  Even, his parents requested her
to come to their house and stay for two to three days and then go back
to her parents house, but there is no response from her.  His parents
kept on asking her for about 15 minutes and went to the extent of
asking her to spend just a few hours at their house and then return
back to her parents house on the same day and in the same taxi.  The
respondent then called her mother on a mobile telephone and after
speaking to her for a few minutes, went to a car brought by her father
and sat in the car.  He states that he has not let his parents know about
the miserable time that he spent in USA, and they knew nothing about
the insults and mental torture that he was subjected to.  His parents
came to the Airport hoping to receive them as a single family and take
them home, but they were disappointed.  His father-in-law also did
not try to persuade the respondent and he just took the baby daughter
and the respondent with him without informing him and without
taking his permission and, till the date of filing of the petition, they
have not even called the appellant and his parents and, thus, his
in-laws separated him from his daughter for more than three months.

        xxxviii)  In paragraph 115, he has given certain details of
valuable items that were said to have given to the respondent and her
family members since the time of marriage and while at Abroad also.
He, therefore, sought dissolution of marriage by grant of decree of
divorce.
        4.  The respondent filed counter resisting the request.  She has
answered the allegations levelled by the appellant in each paragraph
of the petition.  The answers are specific denials on her part.
We, therefore, inclined to refer to the relevant allegations to which the
respondent replied specifically.

        5.  Concerning the allegations averred in paragraph No.33 of
the petition, respondent admits approaching General Medical
Practitioner Dr. Shanti Devaraj, Dr. Julia Gray and Dr. Francis
Ginsberg, when she did not get her periods between April, 2001 and
October, 2001.  She even admits visiting Stamford Hospital in
August, 2001, and Dr. Shanti Devarajs recommendation to get an
ultrasound scan of her uterus and the report showed a poly-ovarian
cyst.  She admits other facts mentioned by the appellant in his
petition.  Thus, she admits the averments up to the pregnancy test
coming out positively, but on the rest of the facts claims that they are
untrue and required the petitioner to prove them with strict proof.

        6.  She admitted the allegations contained in paragraph No.58
of the petition to the extent that she had delivered a baby on the
morning of 2nd September, 2002 and it was a cesarian delivery and
discharged along with baby from the Stamford Hospital in
Connecticut State of U.S.A. on the 5th day after delivery on
6th September 2002.  She admitted even preparing a list of baby items
that have to be purchased and one of the list items are diaper disposal
can, but denied rest of the allegations.  She admitted the appellant
purchasing a Video Camera to record the baby and recording the baby 
along with the Nurse while they were approaching the car, but denied
rest of the allegations as to video-graphing Nurse and other incidental
facts.  She admits the appellant taking her for two post natal visits and
during the first visit, the appellant also accompanying her into the
doctors consulting room and since she was weak, Doctor did some 
tests and told that physically her body was normal and asked her
whether she had any mental depressions, but she replied the Doctor
that she had no such sort of problems.  Thus, she denied the rest of the
allegations as to her comments at the appellant as narrated in the
above.  Even she denied the allegations levelled in paragraph No.84 of
the petition completely.

        7.  She denied the allegation that their baby developed rash on
account of the appellant kissing the baby and other incidental facts.

        8.  According to her, the appellant has invented the allegations
for the purpose of only to show that she is of negative attitude.
Having denied the allegations including the description of articles said
to have been given to the respondent and her parents by the appellant,
she has raised further pleas setting out her case.

        9.  She states that the appellant suffers from an acute skin
disease and he does not take proper care for treatment and he also
passes urine in the bed and she used to persuade him to see the doctor
and to undergo medical treatment and also to consume the medicines 
prescribed by the doctors.  She states that the appellant used to
become wild and behave abnormally sometimes when she used to    
persuade him to consume the medicines and the appellant developed a 
strong inferiority complex on account of these two diseases and he
used to subject her to serious mental and physical cruelty.  She also
states that the appellant never bothered about her basic necessities and
used to behave miserly to such an unbearable extent that he used to
make minute calculations about the value of basic necessities
provided to her like food, clothing, travelling etc., and used to scold
her.

        10.  She states that right from the date of marriage, the appellant
started scolding and used to express his dissatisfaction about the gifts
given by her father and whenever they went to wedding ceremonies,
he used to insult her by degrading her parents and the gifts given by
them and used to harass her by calculating and describing to her that
he would have got more handsome dowry and gifts had he married  
another woman.  The appellant used to travel overseas on account of
exigencies in his service and whenever she requested him to take her
along with him, he used to scold that the food and shelter being given
to her itself were more than enough and that he would never incur
other expenses on her and that if he alone travels, he would save lot of
money.  She states that the appellant used to deliberately insult her
without any reason and used to derive pleasure out of his conduct.
She states that she had menstrual problems on some occasions and on   
those occasions, the appellant refused to provide even medical aid to
her and he used to abuse her in filthy language.  She states that when
she was admitted in a hospital for delivery of child, the appellant
subjected her to untold miseries by not providing any food at all and
she could not consume American food provided by the hospital
authorities except the chicken pieces and the doctors pointed out to
the appellant that she became weak on account of lack of food and she
required home food and though, she pestered the appellant to provide
Indian food, he did not provide the same on the ground that it cost
additional money.  She states that she suffered humiliation in the
presence of her mother on account of appellants behaviour and he
used to put her to lot of embarrassment before her mother by
suspecting that they were always talking only about him though, they
did not.  She states that on account of attitude of the appellant, she
was half starving even after delivery and in spite of requests of her
mother to get provisions for cooking food, the appellant used to avoid
brining the provisions and her mother had to cut short her trip to USA
on account of miserly attitude of the appellant.  She states that the
appellant used to misbehave indecently with other women even in her
presence and she had to suffer humiliation on account of such
behaviour of the appellant with other woman.  He used to physically
misbehave with the other woman and even with the lady doctor
attending her at the time of delivery and in fact the lady doctor at USA
got annoyed by the behaviour of the petitioner and asked him to sit in
his place.  She states that she suffered and tolerated the grave
mentality and physical torture meted out to her, but despite the same,
the appellant has filed the present petition with absolute false
allegations.  She states that the appellant had a pre-plan to desert her
and has packed his own belongings separately before leaving USA 
and left her and stopped talking to her.  She states that the appellant
has packed her belongings separately while leaving USA with the
address of her father and he has also given the same address to the
banks and when she questioned the same, he refused to answer.  He  
states that she was in a state of confusion as to what was the intention
of the appellant, particularly, on account of his refusal to talk to her.
She states that the appellant used to send e-mails to her though, they
were living under the same roof and what all she wanted to know
from the appellant, it was only through e-mails and also enquired him
through e-mails as to whether they were coming back to U.S.A., when 
the appellant was packing his belongings, and belongings of their
child, separately.  But the appellant gave an evasive reply and, thus,
the appellant has mentally and physically deserted her even before
coming to India.  She states that her friends in USA before leaving to
India made efforts to pursue both of them to settle the differences, if
any, amicably and after continuous persuasions, the appellant replied
to her that he wanted to stay separately on account of project work
and with a view to obtain H-1 visa or to get an alternative
employment in Wipro.  She further submits that after arriving at
Hyderabad Airport, the appellant loaded his own package only in a
separate vehicle and her parents also kept the belongings of herself
and her child in the vehicle, but the appellant kept his package
requesting the appellant to take her child and herself with him.  She,
still, further states that she broke down in the airport after seeing her
parents after a long gap and the appellant took advantage of the same
and asked her parents to take her and her child along with them saying
that she was missing her parents very badly.  She states that thus, she
was compelled to go with her parents.  She, therefore, sought to
dismiss the petition with exemplary costs.

        11.  In the petition filed by the respondent  wife, under Section
9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in which, the appellant has filed counter,
the very same allegations and counter allegations have been made and
we, therefore, feel that it is unnecessary to narrate the pleadings in the
said petition.

        12.  The Court below taken up both the O.Ps. for disposal by
way of common order recording the evidence in O.P. No.602 of 2003 
treating it as leading O.P.

        13.  During enquiry, the appellant examined himself as PW.1
besides examining the mediator Sri P.V. Kutumbarao as PW.2, his  
mother Smt. S. Varalakshmi as PW.3, and a neighbour S.M. Bandar   
as PW.4 and their family friend one M.S. Rao as PW.5 and marked  
Exs.P-1 to P-52 to substantiate his case for seeking dissolution of
marriage by grant of decree of divorce, whereas, the respondent
examined herself as RW.1 and her father S. Ranga Rao as RW.2 and   
marked Exs.R-1 to R-10 to prove her stand.
        
     14.  The Court below, on appraisal of evidence, let in by both
sides, both oral and documentary, recorded its findings that the
alleged acts complained by the appellant are in the nature of ware and
tare of a family life and other common and usual family bickerings
and trifling differences by itself cannot be construed as an act of
cruelty and discarding the evidence of PWs.2 and 5, on the ground
that their evidence is not helpful to prove that the respondent has
committed the acts alleged and disbelieving the evidence of PW.5 by
thorough appraisal of his evidence in the light of the probabilities and
finding that the appellant has made a deliberate effort ingeniously to
project the usual and common trifling differences between any spouse
in the common family bickerings and misunderstandings in the
domestic affairs with a magnifying glass to create the said incidents as
an act of mental cruelty, rejected the request of the appellant for grant
of decree of divorce and believing the evidence of the respondent and
basing on the probabilities, granted decree of restitution of conjugal
rights directing the appellant to take back the appellant and resume his
conjugal life with her within one month from the date of decree,
however, directing both the parties to bear their own costs.  It is that
common order which is impugned in the instant appeals by the
appellant  husband, contending in the grounds of appeal that the
Court below did not properly appreciate the evidence on record, and
despite each and every act, the cumulative effect of which accounted
for causing cruelty to the appellant, was brushed aside, though, there
were just denials without any substantiation by the respondent.

        i)  It is stated that the Court below, somehow, deviated in
appreciating the factual aspect substantiated by the appellant by
letting in evidence in abundance, but the Court below, somehow, just
by stating that it was attempted by the appellant to exaggerate and
magnifying common and minute incidents, scored them out without  
any justification.  The Court below did not take into consideration the
admissions made by respondent in her cross-examination which by  
themselves are sufficient enough to entitle the appellant for
dissolution of marriage by grant of decree of divorce.

     ii)  It is also stated that the finding of the Court below that usual
bickerings and some incompatibility have led them to the stage of
separate living, is without any justification. It is also stated that the
finding of the Court below that the appellant has taken hasty decision
without showing any endurance to save his marriage is not based on
proper appreciation of evidence on record, since the appellant endured
cruelty beyond his tolerance limit as narrated in 116 paragraphs of
the petition.

     iii)  It is also stated that the Court below did not appreciate the
ratio laid down by various High Courts including the Honble
Supreme Court that in case of mental cruelty the matrimonial duties
and obligations of the wife are to be examined.  It is stated that the
common order under challenge is bereft of any legal or factual
foundation and is liable to be dismissed and, hence, sought to set aside
the common order and decree.  

     15.  Similar grounds have been agitated by the appellant in the
grounds of appeal in F.C.A. No.16 of 2007 preferred against the order
and decree in O.P. No.369 of 2005 filed by the respondent  wife for
restitution of conjugal rights and, therefore, we are of the view, it is
unnecessary to refer to them again.

     16.  The factual aspect has been narrated in extenso while
referring to the pleadings put forth by both the parties in the above.

     17.  At the outset, we would like to mention that each and every
act alleged by the appellant against the respondent need not be
adverted to, since, in our view, they are in the nature of sundry
bickerings that takes place between the spouses in a domestic life.
We intend to refer to some of the allegations of some importance
levelled by the appellant in the direction of seeking dissolution of
marriage and so also the allegations levelled by the respondent in
seeking restitution of conjugal life.

     18.  Before dwelling on factual aspect with reference to the
proof of allegations thereof, through the evidence let in by both
parties, we would like to refer to the decisions relied on by the
respective parties.
     i)  The learned counsel for appellant, to substantiate his case,
relied on the following decisions:

     a) In Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur , the Honble Supreme
Court dealt with the expression cruelty in the context in which the
said expression has been raised in relation to human conduct or
human behaviour.  The requisite ingredients for constituting cruelty
have been mentioned in paragraph Nos.10 and 11 thus:
10.  The expression cruelty has not been defined
in the Act.  Cruelty can be physical or mental.
Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage
may be defined as wilful and unjustifiable conduct of
such character as to cause danger to life, limb or
health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a
reasonable apprehension of such a danger.
The question of mental cruelty has to be considered
in the light of the norms of marital ties of the
particular society to which the parties belong, their
social values, status, environment in which they live.
Cruelty, as noted above, includes mental cruelty,
which falls within the purview of a matrimonial
wrong.  Cruelty need not be physical.  If from the
conduct of the spouse same is established and/or an
inference can be legitimately drawn that the treatment
of the spouse is such that it causes an apprehension in
the mind of the other spouse, about his or her mental
welfare then this conduct amounts to cruelty.  In a
delicate human relationship like matrimony, one has
to see the probabilities of the case.  The concept,
proof beyond the shadow of doubt, is to be applied to
criminal trials and not to civil matters and certainly
not to matters of such delicate personal relationship
as those of husband and wife.  Therefore, one has to
see what are the probabilities in a case and legal
cruelty has to be found out, not merely as a matter of
fact, but as the effect on the mind of the complainant
spouse because of the acts or omissions of the other.
Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be
mental.  In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and
direct evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty
there may not be at the same time be direct evidence.
In cases where there is no direct evidence, courts are
required to probe into the mental process and mental
effect of incidents that are brought out in evidence.  It
is in this view that one has to consider the evidence in
matrimonial disputes.
11.  The expression 'cruelty' has been used in relation
to human conduct or human behaviour.  It is the
conduct in relation to or in respect of matrimonial
duties and obligations.  Cruelty is a course or conduct
of one, which is adversely affecting the other.
The cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or
unintentional. If it is physical, the Court will have no
problem in determining it. It is a question of fact and
degree. If it is mental, the problem presents
difficulties. First, the enquiry must begin as to the
nature of cruel treatment, second the impact of such
treatment in the mind of the spouse, whether it
caused reasonable apprehension that it would be
harmful or injurious to live with the other.
Ultimately, it is a matter of inference to be drawn by
taking into account the nature of the conduct and its
effect on the complaining spouse. However, there
may be a case where the conduct complained of itself
is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Then the
impact or injurious effect on the other spouse need
not be enquired into or considered. In such cases, the
cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is
proved or admitted (See Shobha Rani v. Madhukar 
Reddi AIR 1988 SC 121). 

        b)  Learned counsel relied on the decision in Vijaykumar
Ramchandra Bhate v. Neela Vijaykumar Bhate , for the 
proposition that proof of cruelty does not depend upon any particular
period or number of incidents of cruel treatment or continuous course
of conduct but depends upon intensity, gravity and stigmatic impact of
it when meted out even once, and the allegations, aspersions and
reproaches which are per se cruel in nature, deliberately made against
wife and placed on record through written statement filed in Court by
husband, have deleterious effect on mental attitude of the wife which
cannot be wiped out by amendment of the written statement 
unilaterally withdrawing those allegations.

        c)  the learned counsel relied on the decision in G.V.N.
Kameswara Rao v. G. Jabilli , for the proposition that the Court has
to come to a conclusion whether the acts committed by the counter-
petitioner amount to cruelty, and it is to be assessed having regard to
the status of the parties in social life, their customs, traditions and
other similar circumstances.  Concerning the factual aspect to suit the
allegations levelled by the appellant that the respondent herein has
removed the Mangalsutra, the learned counsel relied on paragraph
No.14, wherein the Honble Supreme Court while referring to the
earlier decision in S. Hanumantha Rao v. S.Ramani , since in the
said case, the respondent  wife explained that she removed the
Mangalsutra in privacy and handed over the same to the appellant on
his own request, the Honble Supreme Court held that removal of
Mangalsutra would not constitute cruelty within the meaning of
Section 13(1) (i-a).

        d)  In Praveen Mehta v. Inderjit Mehta , the Honble
Supreme Court explaining the term mental cruelty occurring in
Section 13 (1) (i-a), observed thus:

  "Mental cruelty in Section 13(1)(i-a) can broadly
be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the
other party such mental pain and suffering as would
make it not possible for that party to live with the
other. In other words, mental cruelty must be of such
a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be
expected to live together. The situation must be such
that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to
put up with such conduct and continue to live with
the other party. It is not necessary to prove that the
mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to the health
of the petitioner. While arriving at such conclusion,
regard must be had to the social status, educational
level of the parties, the society they move in, the
possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living
together in case they are already living apart and all
other relevant facts and circumstances which it is
neither possible nor desirable to set out exhaustively.
What is cruelty in one case may not amount to
cruelty in another case. It is a matter to be determined
in each case having regard to the facts and
circumstances of that case. If it is a case of
accusations and allegations, regard must also be had
to the context in which they were made".

        e)  The decision relied on by the learned counsel in
Chanderkala Trivedi (SMT) v. Dr.S.P. Trivedi , is unnecessary to
refer to, as it entirely differs from the fact scenario occurring in the
instant case.

        f)  The decision in Lokeshwari v. Srinivas Rao  of this Court,
again differs with fact-situation occurring in the instant case and,
therefore, we are of the view that it is unnecessary to refer to the
observations therein.

        g)  The learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of this
Court in Jayakrishna Panigrahi v. Smt. Surekha Panigrahi , for
the proposition that conduct which inflicts upon other party, such
mental pain and suffering which make it difficult for other party to
live with the other amounts to mental cruelty, and such cruelty need
not be proved to be such as to cause injury to the health of the
petitioner, and what is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty
in another case, and each case has to be decided on the facts and
circumstances of that case.

        h)  Learned counsel relied on the decision in Smt. Kamini
Gupta v. Mukesh Kumar Gupta , for the proposition that in respect
of the incidents and quarrels between the spouses, they must be
weighed from the point of view of impact of the personality and
conduct of one spouse on the other, and Judges do and should read the
minds of the parties.

        i)  In Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh , in the context of meaning
of mental cruelty, the Honble Supreme Court held in paragraph
Nos.98, 99, 100 and 101 thus:
98.  On proper analysis and scrutiny of the
judgments of this Court and other Courts, we have
come to the definite conclusion that there cannot be
any comprehensive definition of the concept of
'mental cruelty' within which all kinds of cases of
mental cruelty can be covered. No court in our
considered view should even attempt to give a
comprehensive definition of mental cruelty.
99.  Human mind is extremely complex and human   
behaviour is equally complicated. Similarly human
ingenuity has no bound, therefore, to assimilate the
entire human behaviour in one definition is almost
impossible. What is cruelty in one case may not
amount to cruelty in other case. The concept of
cruelty differs from person to person depending upon
his upbringing, level of sensitivity, educational,
family and cultural background, financial position,
social status, customs, traditions, religious beliefs,
human values and their value system.
100.  Apart from this, the concept of mental cruelty
cannot remain static; it is bound to change with the
passage of time, impact of modern culture through
print and electronic media and value system etc. etc.
What may be mental cruelty now may not remain a  
mental cruelty after a passage of time or vice versa.
There can never be any strait-jacket formula or fixed
parameters for determining mental cruelty in
matrimonial matters. The prudent and appropriate
way to adjudicate the case would be to evaluate it on
its peculiar facts and circumstances while taking
aforementioned factors in consideration.
101.  No uniform standard can ever be laid down for
guidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate
some instances of human behaviour which may be   
relevant in dealing with the cases of 'mental cruelty'.
The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs
are only illustrative and not exhaustive.
(i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of
the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as
would not make possible for the parties to live with
each other could come within the broad parameters of
mental cruelty.
(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire
matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly
clear that situation is such that the wronged party
cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such
conduct and continue to live with other party.
(iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot
amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language,
petulance of manner, indifference and neglect may
reach such a degree that it makes the married life for
the other spouse absolutely intolerable.
(iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of
deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one
spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time
may lead to mental cruelty.
(v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating
treatment calculated to torture, discommode or render
miserable life of the spouse.
(vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of
one spouse actually affecting physical and mental
health of the other spouse. The treatment complained
of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be
very grave, substantial and weighty.
(vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied
neglect, indifference or total departure from the
normal standard of conjugal kindness causing injury
to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also
amount to mental cruelty.
(viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy,
selfishness, possessiveness, which causes 
unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset
may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the
ground of mental cruelty.
(ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and
tear of the married life which happens in day to day
life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the
ground of mental cruelty.
(x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole
and a few isolated instances over a period of years
will not amount to cruelty. The ill-conduct must be
persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the
relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because
of the acts and behaviour of a spouse, the wronged
party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other
party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty.
(xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of
sterilization without medical reasons and without the
consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly if the
wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without
medical reason or without the consent or knowledge
of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to
mental cruelty.
(xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse
for considerable period without there being any
physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to
mental cruelty.
(xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife
after marriage not to have child from the marriage
may amount to cruelty.
(xiv) Where there has been a long period of
continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that
the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage
becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie.
By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases,
does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the
contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and
emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may
lead to mental cruelty.

        j)  The decision in K. Srinivas Rao v. D.A. Deepa , is relied
on for the proposition that staying together under the same roof is not
a precondition for mental cruelty.

        k)  In Vishwanath Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal ,
the Honble Supreme Court held that in a matrimonial dispute, it
would be inappropriate to expect outsiders to come and depose, and
family members and sometimes the relatives, friends and neighbours
are the most natural witnesses, and the veracity of their testimony is to
be tested on objective parameters and not to be thrown overboard on
ground that witnesses are related to either spouse.

        ii)  Adverting to the decisions relied on by the learned counsel
for the respondent:

        a)  The decision in Gurbux Singh v. Harminder Kaur ,
relied on for the proposition that it is essential for a spouse, who
claims relief, to prove that a particular part of conduct or behaviour
resulted in cruelty to him, and no prior assumptions can be made in
such matters.

        b)  In Subhash Parshuram Seth v. Madhu Manchersingh   
Bhandari , a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat while
answering to a question whether suggestions in cross-examination
constituting evidence, referred to its observations in earlier case in
Shri Khimji Kurjibhai v. The State of Gujarat , which dealt with
regarding the effect of only giving suggestion in cross-examination to
the opponent without giving any evidence in support of any denial
thus:
"Suggestions in cross-examination are no evidence.
This proposition of law is good both in the case of the
prosecution and the defence. Mere hurling of some
suggestions, which are denied, can hardly take the
place of proof or evidence. The law of evidence is
alike both for the prosecution and for the defence. If
the accused wants to establish a certain fact, he has to
lead evidence on that score. Such suspicions cannot
have any place in the realm of appreciation of
evidence. A suggestion denied by a witness remains 
only a suggestion and has no evidentiary value at all."


        c)  In Dr.(Mrs.) Malathi Ravi, M.D. v. Dr.B.V. Ravi, M.D.
(in Civil Appeal No.   of 2014 arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.17 of
2010), the Honble Supreme Court explained the concept of marriage
based on the fact scenario occurring in that particular case and,
therefore, we are of the view, that it is unnecessary to refer to the
observations therein.
        19.  Reverting to the allegations on the basis on which the
appellant seeking dissolution of marriage by grant of decree of
divorce, we would intend to project  nine (nine) of the allegations out
of several allegations, the rest, in our view, needs no deliberation as
they are of insignificance in deciding the controversy, and even
assuming that they did really take place, still, the cumulative effect
thereof is of no assistance to the appellant for the reasons we would
like to mention on each of the nine allegations while arriving at the
conclusion whether or not the appellant is able to prove the cruelty
as required under Section 13 (1) (i-a) of the Act.
        20.  The first allegation of the nine allegations which we have
chosen are of some significance, relates to the respondent herein
asking the appellant to give his money and transfer his property to her
just immediately after the marriage, which according to the appellant,
shocked him.  Whether this allegation is substantiated or not, as per
the evidentiary rule, we would like to refer to the answers given by
him, in his cross-examination, besides the probabilities, which we
would like to discuss the same.  In his cross-examination, when he
was confronted with the said allegation, he answers thus:
     At the time of my marriage I have no other
properties except the bank account opened by my 
employer Satyam computers.  It is not true to suggest
that on the second day after the marriage respondent
never demanded me to transfer my properties in her
name.  Then I have stated to her there is no properties
in my name even if I have any properties there is no
need to transfer my properties in her name as I am
paying tax regularly.

This one admission is sufficient to not only belie the said allegation
which stands first one mentioned in paragraph Nos.1 to 116.  This
apart, the probability that favours the respondent and stands adverse to
the case of the appellant is, the Gift Settlement Deed, gifting of Flat
No.203 in second floor, admeasuring 857 square feet along with 40
square yards of undivided share of land, situated at Ahmed Nagar,
Masab Tank, Hyderabad, by her father, who is examined as RW.2, in  
her favour marked as Ex.R-1. The said gift was made just
immediately after the marriage that was on 23-05-2000.  When the
evidence of RW.2 is perused, it is evident that, to create security, he
has gifted that flat to the respondent by way of execution of the said
Gift Settlement Deed.  In such an event, certainly, the instant
allegation that the respondent demanded him to transfer his entire
properties on her name, gets completely condemned giving an 
inference that this allegation is set up by the appellant deliberately
with a view to obtain decree of divorce.
     21.  The second allegation relates to, that the respondent, on
one occasion, in the context of her brothers wife leaving the house of
his brother, commented about bad character of her brothers wife,
which the appellant has ignored.  According to him, in the said
context, he alleged that one of his relatives told his parents that they
were not treating the respondent well and had not allowed the
appellant to spend time with her, on which, they got upset and stopped
talking to the respondent and he also felt bad and reduced his
interactions with the respondent.
        i)  When the evidence of appellant as PW.1 is scrutinized,
except making a bald statement, nothing-else is forthcoming in that
direction.  We would like to observe that in case, such a situation did
really arise, the prudence of an ordinary man would be to enquire into
such comment as to the truth or otherwise therein and then only to act
according to the situation.  In the instant case, levelling such an
allegation that his parents stopped talking to the respondent and he too
started reducing his interactions with her, would, in fact, amount to
imposing punishment on the respondent rather substantiating his stand
in seeking the relief of dissolution of marriage by grant of decree of
divorce.  This apart, the said allegation exposes the artificial nature
and suffers from want of cogent proof, and it further substantiates the
plea of respondent that the appellant employed ingenious skill in an
attempt to desert her by obtaining decree of divorce. Therefore, we do
not find any truth in the said allegation, and it is so set up only to seek
divorce.
        22.  The third allegation relates to the appellants visit to
Kuwait.  In this connection, the appellant alleged that he faced lot of
humiliation and embarrassment on the night after he left for Kuwait,
and when he returned later, despite giving his arrival schedule, the
respondent did not receive him at the Airport by staying at her
parents house.  He alleged that the respondent abused him when he
reached Kuwait when called her immediately after reaching Kuwait.
According to him, prior to his leaving for Kuwait, though, she learnt
from the discussion between himself and his parents about the
proposed official duty, she exhibited unpleasant behaviour.
The respondent has completely denied the said allegation.
     i)  In his cross-examination, the appellant answers to a question
that he went to Kuwait within three or four days after the intimation
by the Company, but he informed about his trip immediately to the
respondent.  The Company told him they can only send him to 
Kuwait, and he has not taken any steps to take the respondent to
Kuwait along with him. He refers to the shouting of the respondent on
the previous night of his leaving to Kuwait which was witnessed by
Suryanarayana, Panduranga rao with their family members.  He 
admits that he has not informed about the said incident to her parents.
When the allegation in the petition is seen, the appellant states that she
only hurt when he was talking to his parents as to his proposed visit to
Kuwait, whereas in his cross-examination, he states that he has
informed immediately about his trip to the respondent, which, thus,
runs contra to the pleadings made in the petition.  Even, the fact that
the Company told him that they can only send him to Kuwait was not 
pleaded in the petition, besides not informing the respondent about the
said trip.  Thus, though, there is absolutely nothing in that allegation
to cull out any cruelty to the appellant, still, avers the said allegation
in the direction of establishing cruelty, which exposes the artificial
nature of such an allegation.  Though, PW.4 is examined to prove the
shouting of respondent but his categorical admission that he does not
know the nature of shouting and the language, makes us to disbelieve
his evidence.
     23.  The fourth allegation relates to the pregnancy test
undergone by the respondent at USA.  We have already adverted to in
the above while narrating the plea put-forth by the appellant there-for,
in the petition with relevant details.  He denied the suggestion that he
has concocted about the insistence of the respondent upon him to
initiate legal proceedings against the doctor.  He admits, in his cross-
examination, that there was one Human Resource cell in Satyam  
Computers in USA, but later it was transferred to India.  He expresses
his ignorance as to whether HR Cell will conciliate between the wife
and husband for matrimonial disputes, and the duty of HR cell is to
give orientation to the fresh candidates about the environment in
USA, and he never asked for transfer from USA to some other place
on the ground of strained relationship with his wife, and that he was
not having the piece of paper mentioned in paragraph 35 stating that
he might have been lost.  The piece of paper relates to the allegation
that his wife has written that he wanted to kill her baby.  The facts set
out in relation to that paper, appear to be not convincing enough
because of the fact that he has not produced such a paper at all.  Thus,
it exposes the artificiality in the said allegation giving rise to an
inference that it is so set out in an attempt to constitute as one of the
acts accounting for cruelty, to seek the relief of dissolution of
marriage by grant of decree of divorce.


        24.  The fifth allegation levelled by the appellant relates to, the
respondent alleging that the appellant has cut the babys tongue as on
one occasion, that was on the 6th day after delivery, it was found that
blood was oozing from the tongue of the baby child, and admittedly,
they got treated the same by approaching the doctor.  The relevant
details have been mentioned in the above while narrating the
pleadings put-forth by the appellant.
        i)  In this context, we intend to refer to Ex.P-15.  The relevant
details are mentioned in Ex.P-15 which is copy of babys medical
report dated 09-09-2002.  There is nothing to substantiate that
allegation of the appellant, except the observation that blood was
coming from the babys mouth.  In fact, if such a serious allegation is
really made by the respondent, the appellant would not have kept
quiet and would have at least intimated his parents or his sister who
was residing at USA itself about it.  It is specifically asserted by him
that he did not divulge the bickerings or the acts now alleged against
the respondent while they were staying at USA to his parents, which
gives rise to an inference adverse to the said acts now attributed to the
respondent causing cruelty to him.
        25.  The sixth allegation relates to the alleged mental depression
of the respondent, as sought to be projected by the appellant.  We
have given the narration in the above, touching the acts alleged by the
appellant in that regard.  The respondent has specifically denied it
contending that the appellant deliberately designed it in an attempt to
obtain decree of divorce, which, in fact, accounts for a vital aspect of
the controversy between the parties.  Of course, there has been
complete denial when suggestions were made to the appellant, in his
cross-examination, on that aspect of the case.  We would like to refer
to Exs.R-4 and R-6, which is also marked as Ex.P-18 by the appellant,
which resolves the controversy between the parties bringing out the
truth in that allegation.
        i)  The purport of Ex.R-4 is that, the respondent has come out
with when she was persistently asked by the doctor whether she was 
experiencing any abuse at home, answered that she was experiencing  
verbal abuse at times, and that the respondent stated that there was
one or two incidents where there was mild physical abuse, but nothing
else.  The Gynaecologist discussed extensively things with her about
the domestic violence, and the need for a safety plan, and given a
phone number for a domestic violence hotline, but the respondent
refused to take up the follow up action stating that she was leaving for
India in the near future.  Since it constitutes vital piece of
documentary evidence, we intend to extract the entire report which
reads thus:
                 STAMFORD HOSPITAL
                   EMERGENCY DEPT REPORT   
             Surapaneni, Anuradha
                  0313700199 457946
    ADMITTED: 05/17/2003 
       DISCHARGED: 05/17/2003  
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 30-year-old female  
without significant past medical history. She presents
stating that she is 8 months postpartum, status post
C-section, and she had her period start yesterday, and she
has had heavy vaginal bleeding with some weakness, and 
she states that she has gone through six pads a day.
Denies any abdominal pain.  Says she had some  
occasional vomiting for the past month. Denies any other
symptoms.  No abdominal pain.  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: In all 8 systems reviewed.  All    
negative, with the exception of the above-mentioned
findings.
Please refer to the Emergency Medical Physician Record 
for the remainder of the physician documentation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Reveals a 30-year-old    
female who appears stated age, in no apparent distress.
Vital signs stable.  She is not tachycardic.  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive bilaterally. In fact and full extraocular
movements.  No conjunctival injection.  Mucous
membranes moist.  Neck is supple.  Chest reveals good air
entry bilaterally, no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2. Abdomen is soft, no
tenderness, no rebound, no guarding, normal bowel
sounds. GYN exam: No external lesions on the vulva.
Internal exam: No lesion noted, no adnexal masses or
tenderness, no uterine masses or tenderness.  No CMT. 
There is some blood oozing from the cervical os.  So, this
feels like a first menses.  Urine pregnancy test negative.
CBC is normal.  Haemoglobin, hematocrit is 13.89.  Basic
chemistries are normal.  GYN was just called down to
evaluate the patient.  She does have a GYN doctor from
here.  It is Dr. Komarynsky, and GYN did come down 
and evaluate the patient, and they found no abnormalities
on exam.  They believe its a first menses.  However, on
talking with the patient, he asked her if she was
experiencing any abuse at home, and she was.  She was  
experiencing verbal abuse at times.  She said there was
one or two incidents where there was mild physical abuse,
but nothing else, and GYN discussed extensively things
with her about domestic violence, the need for a safety
plan.  Given a phone number for a domestic violence
hotline.  She is leaving for India in the near future, and
she will follow with
Dr. Komarynsky before that.  This was also discussed
with social services and with her, and (__________)
Dr.Goldpin, and she recites understanding of all of this.
So, she was discharged home.  
DIAGNOSIS: Menses and domestic violence. She    
apparently states that she is not ready to leave her
husband, so she was discharged home. However, the OB   
house staff  did suggest to her that she could say, and this
was in front of her husband, that since she has been
feeling weak lately, that there should be someone else
around the house to help her out, and this was a very good
suggestion because she is going to try to do this.
However, she wishes to go back home with her husband. 

        26.  In the same context, we also refer to Ex.R-6, which is a
copy of Ex.P-18.  We only intend to express our opinion on this
document, that it reflects the depressed state of the respondent, but
does not help the appellant in proving the alleged cruelty, more
particularly, in the face of Ex.R-4 contents touching domestic abuse.
        27.  Ex.R-4 is dated 17-05-2003, on which day, the respondent
was admitted and discharged, whereas, Ex.P-18 relates to dated
18-09-2002.  We would like to observe that when read conjunctively
the effect of these two documents is that, there was some sort of
domestic violence faced by the respondent in the hands of appellant,
as there is nothing brought out in her cross-examination disproving
the contents of these two documents.  No doubt, in the petition itself,
the appellant has come out attributing depressed mental status to the
respondent for expressing such a view with doctor, but, they would
make abundantly clear that in fact, it is the respondent, who suffered
in the hands of the appellant, but not the appellant being harassed by
the respondent as contended by him. 

        28.  The seventh allegation relates to hurling of baby bouncer at
the appellant by the respondent.  The details have already been
narrated in the above.  The respondent has completely denied the said
allegation.  No doubt, he made an assertion in affidavit in chief-
examination, but it is difficult to hold that there is truth in the said
allegation when viewed in the context of the conduct of the appellant
as borne out from the discussion on the sixth allegation made in the
previous paragraphs.
        
     29.  The eighth allegation relates to removal of mangalasutra
and dressing like a widow alleged by the appellant.  The facts
touching that allegation were narrated and even the denial made by
the respondent thereon is also narrated while adverting to the
pleadings of both the parties.  In his cross-examination, when it was
suggested to him that the contents in paragraph Nos.99, 100 and 101
are false, he denied the said suggestion stating that the respondent
removed mangalasutra and bindi from 17-03-2003, but the answer
given to a question put to him in the next sentence to the effect that he
does not have any hostile relationship as on that date is sufficient
enough to disbelieve that version.  The further answer that while they
were returning to India in the flight, he carried the child, but he has
not noticed whether the respondent wore mangalasutra and mettalu
in flight, but she did not have bindi, is sufficient enough to reject the
plea put-forth, which accounts for a serious allegation levelled against
the respondent, hailing from Hindu religion.  Since the consistent
stand of the appellant being that the respondent has thrown away
mangalasutra and started wearing white saree as a widow.

        30.  Learned counsel for the appellant, no doubt, relied on the
decision in S. Hanumantha Raos Case (Supra 4), which was  
referred to in the above, which, in our view, is not of any assistance to
substantiate the stand of the appellant, in view of the answer given by
him in his cross-examination.
        
     31.  The ninth allegation relates to the respondent and her
parents not inviting the appellant after they came down to this country
at any time and he has seen his daughter only at the Court premises in
divorce petition when the respondent made appearance.  He made a 
definite admission in his cross-examination that he never made an
attempt to see the child in the house of the respondents parents and
he never made any attempts to get his child, to his house; these
admissions are sufficient enough to discard the said comment made in
the direction of constituting an act of cruelty against him on the part
of the respondent.

     32.  Respondents stand is that the appellant was very
conservative and even he would not provide money for meeting the
domestic expenses in that direction, the e-mails exchanged between
the appellant and the respondent were also exhibited, which are
Exs.P-5, P-9, P-10, P-11 and P-33.  A thorough scanning of the
e-mails would in fact reflect the attitude of the appellant.  On account
of such attitude of the appellant, only about a week prior to their travel
to India there was no direct communication between them.  As an
example, we refer to Ex.P-33 instead of referring to each e-mail.
Through Ex.A-33, the respondent made a request to use Sony Card 
in order to purchase medicines and that she has an appointment with
doctor and she asked the appellants permission to use that card.  The
next day, he replies stating that he has cancelled American Express
and Discovery Credit Card and asked her not to use them.  That has
been the extent to which things went on account of the attitude of the
appellant, but not on account of the respondent at all.  We also would
like to mention the probability of vital significance in the present
context, that despite domestic violence complained by the respondent
before the doctor, that too only when she was enquired by a doctor in
that direction, but, still, not going to the extent of filing a case under
Section 498-A IPC, after their return to in this country as the order of
the day is to invariably resort to such course of action or complaining
to the authorities concerned while they were in States and even giving
up such a course open to her though, advised by the doctors, as seen
from the medical reports referred to in the above would all only
favour the respondent strongly condemning the acts of cruelty alleged
by the appellant in the hands of the respondent.  Even the probability,
the very fact that since some time prior to their departure to India,
giving evasive answers through e-mails in regard to packing the
respective articles separately and even stopping to communicate with
the respondent directly by the appellant would substantiate the stand
taken by the respondent that deliberately he resorted to such conduct
with a view to desert her and seek dissolution of marriage which
proved to be true in filing the petition for dissolution of marriage
under Sections 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act.  The evidence of
PWs.2, 3 and 5 on a thorough appraisal, would not aid the appellant in
substantiating the alleged acts of cruelty.

     33.  We also would like to mention that the principles laid down
by the Honble Supreme Court and Gujarat and Delhi High Courts,
would not assist the appellant in obtaining decree for divorce.

     34.  The Court below rightly observed that the acts complained
by the appellant are usual bickerings on account of differences
between the spouses and common in the domestic life and not of such 
serious nature to entitle the appellant for dissolution of marriage by
grant of decree of divorce.  Therefore, the order under challenge does
not at all warrant interference as it does not suffer from any illegality.
The mere fact that the Court below did not discuss in detail touching
each act of alleged cruelty referred to in paragraph Nos.2 to 116, is no
ground to set aside the impugned common order and decrees.  
     35.  We are, therefore, convinced that there is no legally
acceptable evidence in substantiating the allegation of cruelty
complained by the appellant and consequently we are inclined to
dismiss both appeals as we find no merit at all.

     36.  Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed confirming the
common order passed by the Court below.  We make no order as to   
costs.

     37.  As a sequel thereto, Miscellaneous Applications, if any,
pending in these appeals stand disposed of.

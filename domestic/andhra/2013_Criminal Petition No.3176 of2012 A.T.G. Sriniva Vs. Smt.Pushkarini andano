HONBLE JUSTICE R.KANTHA RAO        
CRIMINAL PETITION NO. 3176 OF 2012     
Dated:17.12.2013 

ORDER:  
        This criminal petition is filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash
the proceedings in DVC No. 1 of 2012 filed under Section 12 of the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (for short the
Act) on the file of the XI Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Secunderabad.

2.      Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the de
facto complainant and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor
representing the State.

3.      The brief facts necessary for considering the criminal petition are
that the marriage of the first respondent was performed with the petitioner
on 14.08.2006, the marriage was consummated, thereafter some disputes  
arose between the parties which resulted in filing the petition for
dissolution of marriage (O.P.No.500 of 2008) in the Family Court,
Secunderabad.  But, the petition was dismissed for the petitioners
absence in attending the Court pursuant to its direction for reconciliation.
Subsequently, the first respondent filed a complaint before the Protection
Officer under the Act alleging physical, mental emotional, verbal and
economic harassment by the petitioner against her.  Thereafter, from the
report of the Protection Officer, DVC No.1 of 2012 under Section 12 of the
Act came to be filed before the XI Special Metropolitan Magistrate,
Secunderabad which case is now sought to be quashed by this Court in 
exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.PC.
4.      The ground on which the domestic violence case was sought to be 
quashed is that four years after parting ways between the parties, the
complaint is filed under the Act, cognizance of which is barred by virtue
of the limitations provided for in Section 468 of Cr.P.C. and in view of the
express provisions of Sections 28, 31 and 32 of the Act, 2005 read with
Rules 15(6) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules (for
short the Rules).
        
5.      According to the petitioner, the second respondent last resided
with him nearly four years prior to filing of the complaint by her before the
Protection Officer under the Act and therefore, the learned Magistrate
ought not to have taken cognizance of the complaint filed by her.

6.      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner invited the attention
of this Court to Section 28 of the Act which deals with procedure and lays
down that all proceedings under Sections 12, 18, 19, 20, 22 and 23 and the
offences under Section 31 shall be governed by the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  Section 31 of the Act deals with
penalty for breach of protection order by respondent and Section 32 of
the Act lays down cognizance and proof, notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the offence under
sub-section (1) of Section 31 shall be cognizable and non-bailable and
also 15(6) of the Rules lays down that when charges are framed under
Section 31 or in respect of offences under Section 498-A of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 or any other offence not summarily triable, the court
may separate the proceedings for such offences to be tried in the
manner prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 and 
proceed to summarily try the offence of the breach of Protection Order
under Section 31, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XXI of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
        
7.      Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner the
proceedings contemplated under the 2005 Act are the criminal
proceedings and any complaint made under the Act has to be filed
within the period of limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Cr.P.C. if
it is not filed within the prescribed period therein, the complaint would be
barred by limitation and therefore is liable to be rejected.
        
8.      On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the first
respondent-wife would submit that there is no limitation provided for
under the entire 2005 Act for taking cognizance of domestic violence
case, even if the parties to the case became separated four years prior to
the complaint, according to the learned counsel, Section 468 of Cr.P.C.
does not come into picture till an order is passed under Section 89 of the
Act.  Therefore, the learned counsel seeks to dismiss the criminal petition
filed by the petitioner.

9.      Strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner-
husband on INDERJIT SINGH GREWAL v. STATE OF PUNJAB AND ANOTHER              
wherein the Honble Supreme Court at para 24 held as follows:

Submissions made by Shri Ranjit Kumar on the issue of limitation, in
view of the provisions of Section 468 Cr.P.C., that the complaint
could be filed only within a period of one year from the date of the
incident seem to be preponderous in view of the provisions of
Sections 28 and 32 of the Act 2005 read with Rule 15(6) of The
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006 which  
make the provisions of Cr.P.C. applicable and stand fortified by the
judgments of this court in Japani Sahoo v. Chandra Sekhar
Mohanty, AIR 2007 SC 2762; and Noida Entrepreneurs Association v.  
Noida &amp; Ors., (2011) 6 SCC 508. 
        
10.     In INDERJIT SINGH GREWALs case 1st cited supra, the Honble   
Supreme Court was dealing with the question as to whether a magistrate
while dealing with a complaint under the provisions of Domestic Violence
Act, can grant reliefs sought under the Act contrary to the judgment and
decree of divorce by mutual consent passed by the Family Court
presided over by a District Judge.  In the case before the Supreme Court
the contention of the wife was that she and her husband obtained
decree of divorce by mutual consent as they wanted to settle in United
States and therefore, they had decided to get divorce on paper so that
the appellant may go to U.S.A. and get American citizenship by
negotiating a marriage of convenience with some U.S. citizen and divorce
her and again re-marry the complainant. She further alleged that even
after decree of divorce she had been living with the appellant till 7.2.2009
and continued co-habitation with him and they had visited several places
together during this period. The child had been forcibly snatched from her
by the appellant. Therefore, she was entitled to the custody of the minor
child along with other reliefs prayed for in the domestic violence case.

11.      The question therefore before the Supreme Court was whether it is
permissible for a party to treat the judgment and order as null and void
without getting it set aside from the competent court. The Supreme Court
referred to an earlier judgment in M. Meenakshi &amp; Ors. v. Metadin
Agarwal (dead) by Lrs. &amp; Ors., (2006) 7 SCC 470, wherein it was
observed as under:
It is well settled principle of law that even a void order is required to
be set aside by a competent Court of law, inasmuch as an order
may be void in respect of one person but may be valid in respect of
another. A void order is necessarily not non-est. An order cannot be
declared to be void in collateral proceedings and that too in the
absence of the authorities who were the authors thereof.
12.     In INDERJIT SINGH GREWALs case 1st cited supra, the contention of  
the wife was that the decree of divorce by mutual consent was obtained
by making false representation and playing fraud on the Court which
passed the decree.  Obviously from the facts of the case, the wife is also a
party to the fraud and misrepresentation.
13.     The Supreme Court dealing with the aforesaid facts held as follows:
From the above, it is evident that even if a decree is void ab initio,
declaration to that effect has to be obtained by the person
aggrieved from the competent court. More so, such a declaration
cannot be obtained in collateral proceedings.
 Respondent no.2 herself had been a party to the fraud committed
by the appellant upon the civil court for getting the decree of
divorce as alleged by her in the impugned complaint. Thus,
according to her own admission she herself is an abettor to the
crime.
No one should have an advantage from his own wrong. 
 The statements/allegations made by the respondent no.2 patently
and latently involve her in the alleged fraud committed upon the
court. Thus, she made herself disentitled for any equitable relief.
In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that
permitting the Magistrate to proceed further with the complaint
under the provisions of the Act 2005 is not compatible and in
consonance with the decree of divorce which still subsists and thus,
the process amounts to abuse of the process of the court.
Undoubtedly, for quashing a complaint, the court has to take its
contents on its face value and in case the same discloses an
offence, the court generally does not interfere with the same.
However, in the backdrop of the factual matrix of this case,
permitting the court to proceed with the complaint would be
travesty of justice. The appeal succeeds and is allowed.
14.     In INDERJIT SINGH GREWALs case 1st cited supra, the Supreme Court     
incidentally expressed its view to the submission made by the counsel
appearing for the wife on the issue of limitation and said that the period of
one year from the date of the incident seem to be preponderous in view
of the provisions of Sections 28 and 32 of the Act 2005 read with Rule 15(6)
of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006 which 
make the provisions of Cr.P.C. applicable.
15.     The portion of the observation relied on by the learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner in INDERJIT SINGH GREWALs case 1st cited 
supra, in my view is an obiter dictum but no ratio has been laid down by
the Supreme Court as to the limitation applicable to the various provisions
under the Act, 2005.  The Supreme Court in my view obviously referring the
penal provisions contained in the Act, 2005 but not to the other provisions.
Section 28 of the Act dealing with the procedure only states as to the
procedure required to be valid in enquiries under the Act.  The penal
provisions under the Act are contained only under Sections 31, 32, 33 and
34 of the Act.  The penal provisions would get attracted only when a
breach of order has been committed or when a protection officer failed
to discharge his duty assigned to him under the Act.  The remaining
provisions only provide for remedies of civil nature.  Therefore, only a
breach of order passed under the Act or dereliction of duty by the
protection officer would constitute offence under the Act.  A complaint
made seeking several reliefs by the aggrieved person under various
provisions of the Act, cannot be said to be in relation to penal provision
attracting the bar of limitation engrafted under Section 468 of the Cr.P.C.
Various reliefs which an aggrieved person is entitled to claim under the
provisions of the Act are civil in nature.  Therefore, an aggrieved person
can file a complaint notwithstanding the bar contained in Section 468 of
Cr.P.C. and the magistrate can grant those reliefs if the aggrieved person
is entitled for the said reliefs.  It is now well settled that even though the
separation between the parties is prior to coming into force of the Act,
2005, the provisions under the Act can be invoked.  Thus, I see no
substance in the contention put-forth by the learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner that the complaint made by the first respondent-wife is
barred by limitation as per the provisions of Section 468 Cr.P.C.  Some
other judgment relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner being
not applicable to the facts of the case on hand, they have not been
referred to in this order.
16.     For the foregoing reasons, the criminal petition is dismissed.

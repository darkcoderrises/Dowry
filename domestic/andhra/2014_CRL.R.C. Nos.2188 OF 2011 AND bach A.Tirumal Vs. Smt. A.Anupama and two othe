THE HONBLE Dr. JUSTICE B. SIVA SANKARA RAO         
CRL.R.C. Nos.2188 OF 2011 AND 959 OF 2013     

COMMON ORDER:      
        These revisions are filed by one and the same
petitioner against the orders in Crl.M.P. No.1054 of 2010
and Crl.M.P. No.115 of 2013, in M.C. No.274 of 2007,
dated 05.08.2011 and 16.04.2013 respectively.           
        02. The revision petitioner in both the revisions, by
name A. Tirumal Raj, is no other than the husband of the
revision first respondent and father of revision
respondents 2 and 3.  The revision first respondent, by
name Smt. A. Anupama, for herself and for two minor
children, filed M.C. No.274 of 2007 before the Additional
Family Court, Hyderabad.   The said maintenance case, 
after full dressed enquiry and on contest by order of the
Judge, Additional Family Court, dated 25.02.2009, was
allowed.
        2(A). The operative portion of the order reads as
under:
In the result, the petition is partly allowed
awarding a sum of Rs.4,000/- each to the
petitioners towards their monthly
maintenance from the date of the petition
i.e. 01.11.2007. The second petitioner is
entitled to maintenance till he attains his
age of majority and the third petitioner is
entitled till her marriage is performed. The
respondent is directed to pay the said
maintenance amount to the petitioners on
or before 10th of every month.  The first
petitioner is directed to open a savings
bank account on any bank of her choice 
and the respondent is directed to deposit
the arrears of maintenance from the date
of the petition till the date of the order in
the said account and continue to deposit
the regular maintenance amount in the
said account.
        2(B) Thus the maintenance award is @ Rs.4,000/- 
each to the three petitioners in M.C. No.274 of 2007 from
the date of petition i.e. on 01.11.2007.
        3. In M.C. NO.274 of 2007 undisputed facts as on
date in nutshall are that
        i) The relationship between the parties from the
marriage between MC first petitioner and MC respondent
was performed in the year, 1995 under Hindu Law and in
their wedlock they blessed with son and daughter, by
names Mayuk and Sharanya (MC second and third    
petitioners) and by the time of filing the maintenance
case they were aged 10 and 6 years respectively,
pursuing their academics under the care of the mother.
        ii) Some time thereafter the MC first petitioner filed
criminal case under Section 494 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860 (for short, I.P.C.) against the MC respondent
(husband), for his alleged performance of second
marriage wife one Saritha in Crime No.382 of 2006.
        iii) She also filed a suit for maintenance @
Rs.4,000/- per month, where interim maintenance was 
also granted in her favour.
        iv) Thereafter MC respondent - husband filed
restitution of conjugal rights in O.P. No.760 of 2000 and
from the wife expressed her willingness to join, the same
was allowed by the Court.
        v) Thereafter she came forward with the
maintenance case saying that her husband did not allow
to enter the house and the civil suit for maintenance
ultimately ended in dismissal from his defence that
despite restitution of conjugal rights O.P. filed by him
was allowed and even he issued notice, she failed to join
his company. 
        vi) On appeal, the High Court confirmed the same in
directing the MC respondent to set up separate residence
and to provide all means for living together that was
complied with by her joining him.
        vii) Having considered all these, the maintenance
case was allowed as referred supra by negating the
contentions of the husband that the wife is not entitled to
maintenance for no neglect on his part, with the
observations particularly in paras 11 to 13 of the order
that the petitioners are entitled to maintenance under
Section 125 Cr.P.C., for the respondent married another
women, by name Saritha, living with her and through
said Saritha, he blessed with a baby girl, by name
Kumari A. Nityasri covered by Ex.P.58 - birth certificate
and the wife is justified in not joining the husband, for
his living with said Saritha and blessed with a girl in that
living, though not wife and though there is no proof of
marriage between them, leave about alleged bigamous 
marriage, particularly, referring to earlier expression of
the Apex Court in Jagdish Jugawat v. Manjulatha ,
minor son till attaining the age of majority and minor
daughter till performance of marriage even became
major, are also entitled to maintenance along with wife
        viii) The D.V.C. No.5 of 2008 filed by the wife
against the husband, even allowed by the learned Judge
awarding Rs.7,000/- per month, the appeal filed by the
husband was closed as withdrawn.  
        ix) During the course of evidence in the
maintenance case, the MC first petitioner  wife was
examined as P.W.1 and placed reliance upon the  
documents Exs.P.1 to P.59 and MC respondent -   
husband was examined as R.W.1 and placed reliance   
upon the documents Exs.R.1 to R.5. 
        x) The MC respondent - husband preferred Criminal
Revision case No.575 of 2009 against the said
maintenance order dated 25.02.2009 in M.C. No.274 of 
2007 before this Court, by order of this Court (another
Bench) dated 02.07.2009, the said appeal was partly
allowed, modifying the maintenance @ Rs.4,000/- per 
month confirming to the wife, however, reducing the
maintenance to the children i.e. minor son and
unmarried daughter (minor) @ Rs.4,000/- to Rs.3,000/-
per month.  It is, thus, the order in M.C. No.274 of 2004,
dated 25.02.2009, is merged with the order in revision
case No.575 of 2009, dated 02.07.2009, under which the
wife is granted maintenance @ Rs.4,000/- per month and 
two children each @ Rs.3,000/- per month that is under
execution from time to time.
        xi) It is important to note further that the husband
filed Crl. M.P. No.1054 of 2010 for cancellation of the
maintenance order in view of order in O.P. No.760 of
2002 for restitution of conjugal rights allowed in his
favour on 24.06.2004 and by order, dated 11.05.2006, in
O.P. No.594 of 2004 negated the maintenance filed by the
wife directing the husband to take a separate residence
and asking her to join him for living together.
        xii) The learned Judge, Additional Family Court,
dismissed the application in Crl. M.P. No.1054 of 2010 by
order, dated 05.08.2011, with an observation that the
orders in O.P. No.760 of 2002 and O.P. No.594 of 2004
were considered in the order, dated 25.02.2009, in M.C.
No.274 of 2007, for awarding maintenance in favour of
the MC petitioners, thereby he cannot re-agitate the said
orders covered by previous proceedings and as such he is
not entitled to cancellation of monthly maintenance on
the basis of the said orders.
        xiii) It is impugning the dismissal order in Crl.M.P.
No.1054 of 2010, the husband filed the Crl.R.C. No.2188
of 2011.
        4. As referred supra, the order in M.C. No.274 of
2007 is merged with the order, dated 02.07.2009, in
Crl.R.C. No.575 of 2009, wherein the wife is entitled @
Rs.4,000/- per month and the children each @ 
Rs.3,000/- per month.
        4(a). Therefrom, the wife filed execution application
in Crl.M.P. No.115 of 2013 and from the contest on both
sides, order was passed on 16.04.2013.  The order reads
that the application filed by the wife along with two
children against the husband for claiming arrears of
maintenance Rs.1,00,000/- from January, 2012 to 
October, 2012 for 10 months (each month @ Rs.10,000/-  
) and the husband was served with notice on 12.02.2013,
thereby he opposed the petition saying as per the
restitution of rights decree, dated 24.06.2004, in O.P.
No.760 of 2002, directing the wife to join him, as she
failed to join and thereby not entitled to claim
maintenance and in support of said contention, he placed
reliance upon some expressions of the Apex Court and 
also claimed that he paid Rs.82,000/- from 10.09.2011
to 10.10.2012.  It was observed, after contest, in the
order of the learned Judge, Additional Family Court, that
the M.C. No.274 of 2007 was allowed subsequently on 
25.02.2009 and the same was confirmed with  
modification of the quantum in Crl.R.C. No.575 of 2009,
by order, dated 02.07.2009, as per which the M.C.
respondent has to pay Rs.10,000/- per month to the wife
and two children and restitution of conjugal rights in
O.P. No.760 of 2002 was part of consideration in passing
the orders and the wife is justified in not joining the
husband after the restitution of conjugal rights order for
that facts that he is living with one Saritha and blessed
with a child at Vijayameri Hospital, where he signed as
father of the child covered by Ex.P.59  hospital record
and the birth certificate of the child  Nityasri covered by
Ex.P.58. She also cross examined him in this regard in
the maintenance case and as Section 125 Cr.P.C.  
explanation enables the same as a just ground for the
wife to refuse to live with him, whether he married or
living with another women by keeping a mistress, as that
was considered in passing the order, dated 25.02.2009,
in M.C. No.274 of 2007 and as such on that ground there
is no authenticity for him to oppose the execution
proceedings.
        4(b) On the other ground regarding C.C. No.524 of
2007 filed by wife against him under Section 494 I.P.C.,
the case ended in conviction, against which there were
departmental proceedings against him and he was 
removed from service by order, dated 10.10.2012, and he
claims that he has no employment, and thereby having 
no means to provide maintenance; that also can be
negated for he being an Engineer and got income from
other source and got immovable properties and receiving
rents from immovable properties and in a position with
sufficient means and thereby by negating the said
contention and holding him liable for the amount of
Rs.1,00,000/- being arrears due, however granted time
with installments to pay.
        4(c). It is impugning the said order in Crl.M.P.
No.115 of 2013, dated 16.04.2013, the husband filed the
Crl.R.C. No.959 of 2013.
        5. The contentions in the grounds of revision in
Crl.R.C. No.959 of 2013 opposing the execution petition
are that the lower court failed to consider the defence
raised by him in the execution petition, on the aspects of
restitution of conjugal rights O.P. direction given for their
living together and civil maintenance O.P. filed by the
wife negated by directing the couple to join together, as
such she is not entitled to maintenance under Section
125 Cr.P.C. and equally to execute the order of
maintenance also, by saying further that even the wife
preferred appeal against dismissal of the civil
maintenance suit that was confirmed by this Court in
F.C.A. No.157 of 2006, dated 02.01.2007, and the wife
also filed M.C. No.274 of 2007 on 01.11.2007 and the
husband filed O.P. No.470 of 2008 for divorce though it
was ended in dismissal and that against application filed
by him in Crl.M.P.No.1054 of 2010 to cancel the
maintenance order that was dismissed on 05.08.2011, he 
preferred Crl.R.C.No.2188 of 2011 and thereby during
pendency, the maintenance order is unexecutable.  It is
also his contention that D.V.C. No.5 of 2008 was filed on
the file of VIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate
for protection orders under Sections 18 to 20 and 22 of
Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the order of the
Magistrate, dated 30.09.2008, granting monthly
maintenance @ Rs.3,000/- to the wife and Rs.2,000/-
each to the children in the D.V.C.  Impugning the same
D.V.C. Appeal No.330 of 2008 also filed by him on the
grounds that she also filed maintenance case and
receiving maintenance referred supra in M.C. No.274 of
2007 and the D.V.C. appeal was allowed setting aside the
D.V.C. Order, dated 30.09.2008 that shows the vindictive
attitude of his wife - M.C. first petitioner in misusing the
provisions of law. His further contention is that his
services are terminated from BSNL, where he was 
working as Junior Telecom Officer from the complaint
she lodged and the trial court in the criminal case filed
by her wrongly concluded in convicting him and even he
filed maintenance modification order and also opposed
the maintenance execution petition, the learned Judge,
Additional Family Court, went wrong in saying he got
immovable property and receiving rents without any
proof in that regard and hence, to set aside the same.
        6. The grounds raised in Crl.R.C.No.2188 of 2011
against dismissal of Crl.M.P. No.1054 of 2010 which was
against the cancellation of maintenance order in M.C.
No.274 of 2007, are the self same referred supra and
nothing beyond including mainly of he lost job and the
Court went wrong in holding that he got means and
properties to pay maintenance.
        7. Heard both sides at length and in the course of
hearing the husband (revision petitioner in the two
revisions) reiterated the said contentions.  Whereas it is
the contention of the counsel for the revision respondents
1 to 3 (wife and two children) that there is nothing to
interfere with the impugned orders of the lower court and
hence to dismiss the two revision cases.
        8.  Both the revision cases are taken up together to
pass common order at request.  Perused the material on 
record. Now the common points that arise for
consideration are,
01.     Whether the impugned orders contain 
any illegality or irregularity or impropriety,
for this Court while sitting in revision to
interfere and if so to what extent?

02.     To what result?


POINT No.1: 
        9. Insofar as the criminal revision case No.959 of
2013, which is a revision impugning the order in Crl.M.P.
No.115 of 2013, which is an execution order of M.C.
No.274 of 2007, merged with the modified revision order
in Crl.R.C. No.575 of 2009 is concerned, practically there
is nothing to interfere for this Court with the execution
proceedings as admittedly M.C. No.274 of 2007 was filed
on 01.11.2007 and the order in M.C. was passed on 
25.02.2009 and the modified order in the revision
preferred by him was also passed on 02.07.2009.  In fact,
as discussed supra and also by the lower court in the
impugned orders, the trial court in passing the orders in
M.C. No.274 of 2007, dated 25.02.2009, categorically
discussed the earlier civil maintenance claim dismissal
order in the O.P. as well as restitution of conjugal rights
order allowed in the O.P. and also the wifes appeal
confirmed against the dismissal of the said civil
maintenance claim in directing the husband to provide
separate residence with all provisions, for the wife to join
him and the same were prior to the filing of maintenance
case on 01.11.2007.  Apart from it, after consideration of
those orders only and particularly with reference to the
scope of Section 125 Cr.P.C. and its proviso, the orders
are not a bar from the subsequent events, more
particularly, covered by Exs.P.58 and P.59 of M.C.
No.274 of 2007 that was also confronted to the husband,
who admitted in his cross examination also of the child
born to him through the said Saritha also in the birth
certificate he was shown as father of the child and the
bygomous marriage case filed by the MC first petitioner
against him (husband) for his alleged marriage second
time with Saritha that was ended in conviction.  It makes
no difference in so far as execution and maintainability of
maintenance order under execution concerned. In fact,
once the maintenance order passed by the Court 
confirmed in revision by him upholding the maintenance
filed by wife including on the quantum by the revision
Court and that reached finality there is resjudicate and
obitor against the husband with bar against his re-
agitating the same on that ground including by invoking
Section 127 Cr.P.C. but for any other grounds like he lost
Job.  Thus even coming to the Crl.R.C. No.2188 of 2011
against the order in Crl.M.P. No.1054 of 2010, dated
05.08.2011, he is not entitled to urge the self same
grounds of restitution of conjugal rights filed by him was
granted in his favour in directing him to provide separate
residence and means for their living together and even
the wife not joined, she is justified from the subsequent
consequences supra of husband living with one Saritha
and he blessed with female child which are also proved
by Exs.A.58 and A.59 marked during the course of her 
evidence in the M.C. and also admitted when confronted
to him, particularly, birth certificate - Ex.P.59, during his
cross-examination.  Even coming to his claim of
modification of maintenance from he lost his job after
filing of the criminal case under Section 494 I.P.C. by the
wife against him saying he married Saritha second time
that was ended in conviction in the trial court and from
which his services are terminated concerned, with the
application he did not file even a scrap of paper in
modification of the order in Crl.M.P. No.1054 of 2010 on
lack of means. In fact, so far as the order in Crl.M.P.
No.1054 of 2010 is concerned, there is a clear
observation that he got immovable properties also and
receiving rents therefrom and he is also a qualified
Engineer and got other avocation and earnings.
        10. Having regard to the above, there is nothing to
interfere, but for the said order no way impediment for
his filing a fresh petition under Section 127 Cr.P.C. by
giving him opportunity by virtue of this order, if he is
able to show he has no means to pay the said quantum  
of maintenance to reduce for he is able bodied to
maintain the wife that too qualified Engineer and having
shown some properties and receiving rents, but for if at
all to reduce the quantum to the wife and the children.
Needless to say that he is entitled by virtue of the very
original maintenance order in M.C. No.274 of 2007 to
seek non liability, if the son attained majority and the
marriage of the daughter if shown performed.
        11. Needless to say sending him to the jail for
execution of the order no way absolve him from the
liability of the recovery as per the expression of the Apex
Court in Kuldeep Kaur v. Surinder Singh   holding the
default in payment in the proceedings for recovery of
arrears of maintenance to the wife and children, sending
of husband to jail is not a mode of discharging the
liability being a mode of recovery and not a substitute for
recovery, the Apex Court directed to put the husband in
jail till he makes payment and application for recovery of
arrears by wife, the husband cannot be absolved from
liability merely because he prefers to go to jail. Even the
expression of this Court in Medarmatla Krishna Reddy
v. Medarmatla Padmavathi  is that as per Sub-Section
3 of Section 125 Cr.P.C. proviso (2), if there is a
justifiable cause to the wife to stay away, the husband
cannot raise the issue of non liability of maintenance and
he even offers maintenance to the wife, unless she joins,
she can enforce the maintenance by execution as such 
an offer during execution is untenable, however, a person
cannot be imprisoned straight away under Section 128
Cr.P.C. for non payment of maintenance unless his
properties, if not attached and sold in the first instance
and if the sale proceeds are not sufficient to meet the
arrears accrued as then only he should be imprisoned.
In fact, the expression of this Court in Krishna Reddy
supra, the expression of the Apex Court in Smt. Kuldeep
Kaurs case supra was not referred and there was no
such prohibition to send to jail without destraint warrant
and proceeding against properties.      Furthermore, the
wording of Section 128 Cr.P.C. says a copy of the order of
maintenance shall be given without payment to the
person in whose favour it is made, or to his guardian, if
any or to the person to whom the allowance is to be paid;
and such order may be enforced by any Magistrate in any 
place where the person against whom it is made may be, 
on such, Magistrate being satisfied as to the identity of
the parties and the non- payment of the allowance due.
It is to say Section 128 of Cr.P.C. not provided with
procedure of destraint warrant against properties to
recover before seeking to send to jail as mode of recovery.
Pursuant to the expression of the Apex Court in Smt.
Kuldeep Kaurs case supra, for the default in payment in
the recovery proceedings initiated by wife and children,
the husband can be straight away sought to be sent to
jail till he makes payment and there is no provision
specifically of firstly for proceeding against the properties
by destraint warrant and only after exhausting that
remedy or by showing of no properties to seek for sending
to civil prison.  In view of the said expression of the Apex
Court and in the absence of specific provision to that
extent the expression in Krishna Reddy (supra) is not
serving as a precedent, but for to say from the Division
Bench of this Court in 2004(1) Law Summary 63 in 
interpreting Section 125(3) Cr.P.C. and payment of
maintenance does not automatically makes liable to
imprisonment on passing order of maintenance, but for
execution, whether there is an order in issuing of warrant
to undergo the imprisonment for default in payment and
the imprisonment term may extend to one month or until
payment, if sooner and even Magistrate has no power to
imprison beyond one month in each of the execution
petitions for breach of non - payment of the order of
maintenance, as the wife and children can approach
Magistrate again for similar relief, it is to say for each of
the month claim, a separate petition can be filed,
however, if maintenance is not paid and not filed
separate petition for each month, if consolidated for
several months, one application can be filed, where the
period of imprisonment can be maximum one month to   
each application.
        12. Having regard to the above, the contention that
without destraint warrant, the Magistrate cannot pass
any order to send him to civil prison is also not tenable,
but for to say in each of the execution application, the
imprisonment period shall not exceed more than 30 days.
        13. Even a perusal of the expression place reliance
with memo by revision petitioner of Hemraj v. Urmila
devi , Chand Begum v. Hyderbeig , Muralidhar Ghadei
v. Smitra Ghadei , Nagendrappa Natikar v. Neelamma 
Harish v. Hansagauri , M.Ganeshan v. Ganganaiki 
though speak on the principle of a civil court decree is
relevant and binding to some extent on the criminal court
here the facts are different as detained supra to say no
application. Even coming to another expression of the
Apex Court in Shail Kumari Devi & Another V. Krishan
Bhagwan Pathak @ Kishun B.Pathak, Civil Appeal   
No.4666 of 2008, dated 28.07.2008, it was the
expression in relating to the order in payment of
maintenance where from the date of petition or from the
date of order bears on facts of each case where interim
maintenance order passed was confirmed from the date 
of petition pending final adjudication and thereby held
from the date of order final maintenance that can be
passed. Even the decision has no application for the
present facts much less to agitate the main order of
maintenance that was made final, modifying the order in
the revision preferred by the husband and reached
finality as such, not open for challenge in the execution
but for liberty is given for any changed worthy
circumstances to show and prove to reduce the quantum, 
if at all so far as against the wife and for non liability
also, if at all the marriage of the daughter is shown
performed or son became major and not otherwise. 
Accordingly, point No.1 is answered.
POINT No.2: 
        14. In the result, both the revisions are dismissed,
however, giving liberty to the revision petitioner in
Crl.R.C. No.2188 of 2011 impugning the order in Crl.M.P.
No.1054 of 2010 that no way a bar to his filing fresh
application under Section 127 Cr.P.C. for alteration of
the maintenance order, if he is able to show that son
attained majority by virtue of the original maintenance

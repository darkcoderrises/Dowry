Criminal Petition No.5970 of 2014

Date: 12-9-2014

Order:

        The petitioner, who is the sole respondent in
D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 on the file of the III Additional
Junior Civil Judge, Chittoor, seeks for the quashment
of the same.  The 2nd respondent is his wife.
The 3rd respondent is the son of the petitioner and the
2nd respondent.  The 2nd respondent laid case seeking for
reliefs of protection under Section 18 of the Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, (the D.V. Act,  
for short) and of monetary reliefs under Section 20 of the
D.V. Act.  The petitioner claimed that the very case is not
maintainable on the ground that the same is barred by
limitation and consequently seeks for the quashment of
D.V.C.No.25 of 2012. 

Res Judicata:
     2. The 2nd respondent and the petitioner were
married to on 06-8-2006.  The 3rd respondent was born
on 18-6-2007.  It is the case of the 2nd respondent that
since the time of the birth of the child, the petitioner
started harassing her for dowry and other financial
benefits.  The 2nd respondent filed D.V.C.No.15 of 2008
as well as M.C.No.31 of 2008 seeking for various reliefs
under the provisions of the D.V. Act and under the
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     3. Sri A.Prabhakar Rao, learned counsel for the
respondents 2 and 3, submitted that a compromise was  
struck between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent
during the pendency of D.V.C.No.15 of 2008 and 
M.C.No.31 of 2008 when the petitioner agreed to take
back respondents 2 and 3 into the matrimonial home 
subject to withdrawal of D.V.C.No.15 of 2008 and
M.C.No.31 of 2008.  It is his further case that on
20-12-2008, the 2nd respondent withdrew both the cases 
in terms of the oral compromise.

     4. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3
further submitted that after withdrawal of the cases, the
respondents 2 and 3 went to Pune to join the petitioner
as he was working at Pune as a Software Engineer at that
time.  He alleged that the petitioner refused to admit
respondents 2 and 3 into the matrimonial home initially
on the ground that the time was not auspicious.
Allegedly, the petitioner later started demanding for
additional dowry.

     5. The 2nd respondent became helpless and was 
forced to file D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 on the file of the
IV Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Chittoor.
The same was later transferred to the Court of the
III Additional Junior Civil Judge, Chittoor and was
renumbered as D.V.C.25 of 2012.  The learned counsel 
for the respondents 2 and 3 pointed out that the
petitioner has earlier filed a petition in Criminal Petition
No.10314 of 2011 under Section 482 Cr.P.C for
quashment of D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 and that the same was  
dismissed by this Court through orders dated 02-7-2013
after hearing both sides.  The learned counsel for the
respondents 2 and 3 contended that the present petition
is not maintainable in view of the orders dated 02-7-2013
in Crl.P.No.10314 of 2011 which would operate as
res judicata or issue estoppel.

     6. Sri C.M.R. Velu, learned counsel for the
petitioner, on the other hand, submitted that there is no
bar for filing a 2nd petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
He further contended that the plea of limitation had not
been taken in the earlier petition and that the present
petition is laid on the sole ground that D.V.C.No.3 of
2010/D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 is barred by limitation.
He contended that in the earlier petition in
Crl.P.No.10314 of 2011, the petitioner contended that
D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 was laid by the 2nd respondent as
a counterblast to the petition by the petitioner seeking for
restitution of his conjugal rights.

     7. In K.Chinni Krishnaiah vs. State of A.P. ,
it was noticed that the provisions under Order II,
Rule 2 C.P.C do not apply to criminal proceedings and
that a 2nd quash petition certainly would lie.
The Division Bench referred to Superintendent and
Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal vs. 
Mohan Singh (AIR 1975 SC 1002) which declared that  
the principles of res judicata do not apply to criminal
proceedings.  Indeed, the Court proceeded on other
points in deciding that case.

     8. In D.Narayana Rao vs. B.V.S. Lakshmi , it was
noticed that entertaining successive applications or
a 2nd application for quashment is not prohibited by law
albeit propriety requires that such applications shall not
be entertained unless there are changed circumstances.

     9. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the changed circumstance in the present petition is
that a new ground has been taken.  As already noticed,
in the earlier petition in Crl.P.No.10314 of 2011,
the petitioner urged that D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 was
a counterblast to his petition for restitution of his
conjugal rights.  In the present case, the only ground on
which quashment is sought is that D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 
is barred by limitation.

     10. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended
that taking a new plea would be tantamount to changed
circumstance.  In MADAN LAL ANAND V/S UNION OF       
INDIA , a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had
occasion to consider this question.  In that case, the
petitioner challenged the legality of the detention order
against him passed under the provisions of the
Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of
Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA Act).  
A defence was taken that the petitioner was abusing the
legal process by filing petition after petition questioning
his detention.  The petition in question was the
3rd petition from the petitioner.  The Division Bench of
the Delhi High Court observed that in matters of
detention, neither the principles of res judicata nor the
principles of constructive res judicata would apply if the
petition is based on fresh or additional grounds and that
each case has to be decided on its own merits.
     11. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the petitioner has taken a new ground,
viz., that D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 is barred by limitation and
that the petition therefore cannot be dismissed in limine
on the ground that it is a repetition of the exercise which
was made by the Court in Crl.P.No.10314 of 2011.
The order in Crl.P.No.10314 of 2011 would show that the
stand taken by the petitioner in that case was that
D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 was a counterblast.  In the present
case, D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 which was renumbered as  
D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 is questioned on the ground of
limitation.  Added to it, the earlier petition was argued by
the petitioner himself as a party-in-person whereas
he had legal assistance in the able stewardship of
Sri C.M.R. Velu in this petition.  In view of the fact that
a new ground has been taken in the present quash 
petition which had not been taken earlier, I consider that
it would be appropriate to entertain the present petition
on merits.  I accordingly dispose of this petition on
merits.

MERITS:  
     12. The basic contention of the petitioner is that
D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 is barred by limitation.  It is his
case that the 2nd respondent deserted him on 07-02-2007 
and laid D.V.C.No.3 of 2010 on 06-01-2010, about
3 years after the desertion.  He submitted that as the
D.V.C was filed about 3 years after the separation, the
same is barred by limitation.

     13. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and
3, on the other hand, submitted that after the separation
between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and after
the 2nd respondent laid D.V.C.No.15 of 2008 and
M.C.No.31 of 2008, there was a compromise between the  
parties, so much so, limitation cannot commence to run
from 07-02-2007.  It is submitted by the learned counsel
for the petitioner that there is no proof regarding the
compromise alleged by the 2nd respondent.  I am afraid
that the question of compromise raised by the
2nd respondent is a question of fact which cannot be
considered in this petition.  Where the delay, if any, has
been explained by the 2nd respondent which can be 
considered on merits only on facts, the dispute becomes
a question of fact.  Again, it is not proper nor is it
permissible for me to go into the question of fact in this
petition as the same deserves to be decided on merits
after evidence by both sides.  I therefore consider that
whether the delay, if any, has satisfactorily been
explained by the 2nd respondent shall be determined by
the Trial Court and not by me.

     14. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3
submitted that there is no limitation for a petition under
the provisions of the D.V. Act.  The learned counsel for
the petitioner had referred to Section 31 of the D.V. Act.
Section 31 of the D.V. Act reads:
31. Penalty for breach of protection order by
respondent:-
      (1) A breach of protection order, or of an interim
protection order, by the respondent shall be an offence
under this Act and shall be punishable with
imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend
to twenty thousand rupees, or with both.
      (2) .              
      (3) .                     


     15. The learned counsel for the petitioner also
referred to Section 468 Cr.P.C.  It is convenient to extract
the same: 
468. (1) Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in
this Code, no Court shall take cognizance of an offence
of the category specified in sub-section (2), after the
expiry of the period of limitation.
      (2) The period of limitation shall be
      (a) six months, if the offence is punishable with
fine only;
      (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year;
      (c) three years, if the offence is punishable with
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year but not
exceeding three years.
      (3) For the purposes of this section, the period of
limitation, in relation to offences which may be tried
together, shall be determined with reference to the
offence which is punishable with the more severe
punishment or, as the case may be, the most severe 
punishment. 

     16. It is contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the period of limitation is one year if the
offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not
exceeding one year.  Reading Section 31 of the D.V. Act
with Section 468 (2) Cr.P.C., it is submitted by the
learned counsel for the petitioner that where the
punishment is for a maximum period of one year, the
period of limitation is one year under Section 468 Cr.P.C
and that as the petition was laid about 3 years after the
desertion, the same is barred by limitation.

     17. In Inderjit Singh Grewal v. State of Punjab ,
the Supreme Court held that the provisions under
Section 468 Cr.P.C would apply to the Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.  In that case, 
there was a decree of divorce between the wife and
husband granted on an application by both parties
seeking for divorce by mutual consent.  When the wife
again tried to invoke the provisions of the D.V. Act, the
Court intervened.  In the present case, the matrimonial
relationship between the petitioner and the
2nd respondent has not been snapped.  Added to it,
it is the contention of the petitioner that he filed
a petition for restitution of conjugal rights seeking for the
company of the 2nd respondent.  The petitioner therefore
cannot equate himself with a former husband who 
obtained divorce from a competent Civil Court on an
application by both parties for grant of divorce by mutual
consent.  Further, the Supreme Court considered that
the provisions of Section 468 Cr.P.C that the complaint
could be filed within one year from the date of the
incident was justified in view of Sections 28 and 32 of the
D.V. Act read with Rule 15(6) of The Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Rules, 2006. 

     18. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3
submitted that the incident referred to in Section 31 of
the D.V. Act is breach of protection order and not
a prayer for protection order.  He further submitted that
proceedings under Section 12 of the D.V. Act do not
have any element of criminality, so much so,
Section 468 Cr.P.C has no application.  In Mohd. Akber
Yaseen v. Rizwana Sulthana , the Court observed that
there is no criminality in a petition under Sections 12
and 18 to 23 of the D.V. Act.

     19. In Valisetti Chandra Rekha v. State of A.P. ,
it was noticed that a person suffering an order under the
D.V. Act could not be punished for violation of the
protection orders passed under Section 18 of the D.V. Act
or residence orders passed under Section 19 of the
D.V. Act and held that for filing of a case under
Section 12 of the D.V. Act, there cannot be any
limitation.

     20. Section 468 Cr.P.C provides limitation.
However, Section 31(1) of the D.V. Act contemplates
punishment in the event of a breach of the protection
order.  Section 31 of the D.V. Act does not come into play
till a protection order is passed and till the same is
breached.  In the present case, the 2nd respondent is
seeking for various reliefs contemplated by the D.V. Act.
Assuming that those reliefs are granted to the
2nd respondent, in the event they are violated, the
2nd respondent would be entitled to invoke Section 31 of
the D.V. Act within one year from the date of the
violation.  The provision under Section 31(1) of the
D.V. Act is similar to the provision under
Section 125(3) Cr.P.C.  Consequently, the petitioner
cannot claim that D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 is barred by
limitation on the ground that the 2nd respondent deserted
him nearly 3 years prior to the filing of D.V.C.No.3 of
2010/D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 and that the same therefore is
barred by limitation.

     21. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3
contended that the trial of D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 has
already concluded and that the 2nd respondent in fact
had advanced her arguments.  He submitted that 
it would be unjust for the petitioner now to approach the
High Court and seek for the quashment.

     22. The learned counsel for the petitioner placed
reliance upon PEPSI FOODS LTD. v. SPECIAL     
JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE , where it was held that   
an accused may approach the High Court under  
Section 482 Cr.P.C at any stage of the proceedings.
However, when the petitioner had opportunity to
approach the High Court through a petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C and has utilized the same through
a petition in Crl.P.No.10315 of 2011, approaching this
Court again through the present petition after the
completion of the trial in the D.V.C would be abuse of the
process of law.  As already noticed, the question of delay
in approaching the Trial Court and other circumstances
are questions of fact which deserve the attention
of the Trial Court and not in a petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C.  Where the trial has already
concluded in the D.V.C and where the 2nd respondent 
has already advanced her arguments before the Trial
Court, I consider that there is no justification in the
petitioner approaching this Court and seeking for the
quashment of D.V.C.No.25 of 2012.  It would be
appropriate for the petitioner to go before the Trial Court,
submit his arguments and seek for an order from the
Trial Court.  In this background, I see no grounds to
quash D.V.C.No.25 of 2012 on the file of the
III Additional Junior Civil Judge, Chittoor.

     23. This criminal petition, accordingly, is dismissed.
The learned III Additional Junior Civil Judge, Chittoor is
requested to dispose of D.V.C.No.25 of 2012
expeditiously, preferably within two months from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order, after according
an opportunity to both sides to advance further
arguments.  The miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending
in this petition shall stand closed.

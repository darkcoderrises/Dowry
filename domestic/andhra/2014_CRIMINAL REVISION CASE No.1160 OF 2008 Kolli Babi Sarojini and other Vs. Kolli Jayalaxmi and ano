HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE S.RAVI KUMAR          
CRIMINAL REVISION CASE No.1160 OF 2008       

Dated 29-4-2014 

ORDER:  
                  This revision is against order dated 25-6-2008 in Criminal
Appeal No.42 of 2008 on the file of V Additional Metropolitan
Sessions Judge, (Mahila Court) at Hyderabad whereunder order 
dated 6-11-2007 in D.V.C.No.11 of 2007 on the file of III
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad is set aside.
          2.     Parties are herein after referred to as complainant and
respondents as arrayed in the D.V.C.No.11 of 2007 for
convenience and for better understanding.
3.           The brief facts leading to this revision are as follows:
     Complainant filed petition under Section 12 of Protection
of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter 
referred to as Act 2005) contending that her marriage with
Kolli Narendrababu (son of first respondent and brother of
respondents 2 and 3) was solemnized on 9-5-1987 at 
T.T.D.Kalyanamandapam, Tirupathi and it was an arranged 
marriage.  After marriage, couple left for Vijayawada on
10-5-1987 which is the place of in-laws of the complainant and
marriage was consummated on 11-5-1987.  After some time,  
couple shifted to Hyderabad.  In a couple of weeks after the
marriage, complainant noticed that the respondents cheated her
and her father by suppressing the fact that her late husband
Narendrababu was suffering from psychological disorder and
was not mentally sound.  Three months after the marriage, her
husband left for Vijayawada on the pretext of the ailment but
respondents 1 and 2 did not allow him to return back to
Hyderabad and complainant was forced to go to Kodada to her 
in-laws house and there complainant was treated like a maid
servant.  At the time of marriage, it is informed to the father of
the complainant by the first respondent and her brother
Y.Venkataratnam Babu and respondents 2 to 4 that 13 shops  
located at Nela Kondapalli village in Khammam District were
allotted to the share of Narendrababu though they stand in the
name of 2nd respondent and all the benefits arising out of those
shops can be enjoyed by the complainant and her husband after 
marriage.  But first respondent was collecting rents from the
tenants of the above mentioned shops at Nela Kondapalli village
and never paid rents to the complainant or her husband.
Complainant was blessed with a girl child by name Gouthami on 
18-8-1988 and at the age of two years, her daughter was
snatched away from her and kept at the house of respondents 3
and 4.  Complainant was harassed and her life was made 
miserable which made her to leave the house to reach her
fathers house.  She approached Woman Protection Cell in the
year 1992 and on the counselling by the protection cell, she
came back to matrimonial house.  Thereafter, complainant was 
blessed with boy on 23-7-1993 and after the birth of boy, first
respondent separated complainant and her husband and was   
paying a meager some of Rs.1500/- towards monthly  
expenditure of the complainant and her two children and that
compelled her to borrow money from her father and her brother
for monthly maintenance.  On the intervention of elders, the
complainant was allowed to collect rents from 13 shops and
respondents also paid a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- to the complainant
styling it to be the share of her husband.  On 23-5-2006, wife of
2nd respondent passed away and after the ceremonies, 
complainants daughters mind was polluted by the respondents
and she was taken away to the respondents house at S.R.Nagar  
and complainant and her husband returned to Hyderabad on  
7-6-2006.  Complainant was not allowed to meet her daughter.
Respondents instructed the tenants of the shops to stop payment
of rents from June, 2006 and the second respondent started
collecting those rents.  While so, complainant husband suffered
from sever chest pain on 28-1-2007 and he was treated as out
patient at Nikhil Multi Specialty where they suggested surgery.
None of the respondents showed any humanity nor responsibility
and the petitioner lost her husband on 4-2-2007 because of the
sheer non-cooperation of the respondents.  After the ceremonies,
complainant was wrongfully confined at Kodada and with great
difficulty, she could reach at her maternal uncles house at
Guntur and the son of the complainant was also taken away by 
respondents by polluting his mind.  Hence, the petition to direct
respondents to pay Rs.20,00,000/- being the rents collected by
them over the complainants property of 19 shops for the period
from 8-7-2001 and June, 2006-June, 2007, to direct the
respondents to redeliver those 19 shops  to the complainant and
further to direct the respondents not to sell those 19 shops and to
direct respondents to handover custody of her two children.
     4. Respondents filed reply to the above petition
contending that complaint is not maintainable and the provisions
of Act, 2005 are not applicable.  It is contended that there is no
domestic relationship and the complainant do not fall under the
definition of aggrieved person.  It is further contended that
complainant and respondents never had any share household, 
first respondent, complainant and her husband stayed together
only during the time of marriage ceremonies in the year 1987
and immediately, they moved to Hyderabad and during their stay
at Hyderabad, the complainant was moving closely with some 
men which caused annoyance to her husband Narendrababu.    
The complainant was demanding huge amount for her luxurious  
life, for which, her husband was very upset and latter,
Narendrababu went to Kodada and complainant also joined him  
at Kodada.  First respondent was mostly residing at her brothers
house and subsequently, on the pretext of children education,
complainant moved her family to Hyderabad in the year, 2001.
These facts would clearly reveal that the complainant and her
husband never had a shared house as defined under the Act.  The
complainant herself abandoned children and left the home on
10-2-2007 due to her adulterous acts.  Shops at Nelakondapalli
village belong to the second respondent and the complainant has
no right whatsoever on that property.  Family partition has taken
place much before the marriage of complainant, and the
respondents supported Mr.Narendrababu financially to do
contracts.  From the inception of marriage, behaviour of
complainant was strange and she was interested in luxurious
way of life and she was moving freely with men in an
undesirable fashion.  When her husband objected for the same,
complainant did not care him which caused mental depression to 
Narendrababu.  He was hale and healthy before marriage and 
due to unwanted behavior of complainant, he developed mental
disorder.  The respondents, due to abundant love towards
Narendrababu, used to help him financially.   The shops at
Nelakondapalli village are self acquired properties of second
respondent and due to his soft corner towards his brother and
his brothers children, second respondent allowed them to collect
rents of six shops initially and the complainant and her husband
had no share in the said property.  Complainant has developed
closeness with one Anilkumar an L.I.C.agent, when she was 
moving with him, her husband and children strongly objected
with her activities.  This Anil kumar went to the extent of
scolding children, attempted to sexually abuse against the
daughter of the complainant by misbehaving with her.  This was
brought to the notice of maternal uncle of the daughter
(Gowthami) and Mr.Narendrababu was informing the  
respondents that in the event of his death, they have to take care
of his children and even during his life time, he advised his
daughter to stay with his sister for her security.  The complainant
committed more cruel acts towards her husband by indecent 
behavior with Anil Kumar in his presence.  Respondents 1  to 4
nor brother of first respondent Venkata Ratnam Babu never gave
any assurance to complainant or her father that
13 shops located at Nelakondapalli village would be given to the
husband of the complainant and this property was purchased by 
second respondent in the year 1977 with his self acquired
income and he is the absolute owner of the property.  In fact, he
purchased vacant site and latter on, constructed shops in that
property.  The Grampanchayat records and cist receipts would
prove that the 2nd respondent is the owner of the shops.  Petition
under the provisions of Act, 2005 is not maintainable and the
allegations made by the complainant are baseless and false and
the petition is liable to be dismissed.
     5. On these allegations and counter allegations, III
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad dismissed
the petition filed under Section 12 of the Act, 2005 and
aggrieved by the said dismissal, complainant carried the matter
in appeal to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, and V Additional
Metropolitan Sessions Judge by order dated 25-6-2008 allowed
the appeal by setting aside lower courts order and remitted the
matter back to the trial court and aggrieved by the same,
respondents preferred present revision.
     6, Both sides have argued at length in support of their
respective claims and the sum and substance of the arguments is
according to respondents, application under the provisions of
Act, 2005 is not maintainable and the learned Sessions Judge
erred in remitting back the record with a direction to consider
the documents filed on behalf of the complainant in respect of
the property at Nelakondapalli village and the trial court, in a
domestic violence application, cannot decide title of the property
and the remedy of the complainant is before civil court and the
order of the learned Sessions Judge is contrary to the spirit of Act,
2005.
     7. On the other hand, it is the contention of the
advocate for complainant that the learned Sessions Judge has
rightly remitted back the case to the trial court as the learned
Magistrate has not considered the documents filed on behalf of
the complainant showing that she was collecting rents of the
shops and no prejudice would be caused if the Magistrate
reconsiders the application of the complainant on the basis of the
documents. 
     8. Now the point that would arise for my consideration
in this revision is whether order of the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate and the judgment of the learned Metropolitan
Sessions Judge are legal, correct and proper?
9.     POINT:
     Before going into the contentions and rival contentions of
both parties, I must first refer to the prayer in the petition filed
under Section 12 of the Act, 2005.  There are six reliefs that are
claimed by the complainant.
     10.        First relief is to direct the respondents to pay
Rs.20,00,000/- being the rents collected by respondents over the
complainants property of 19 shops situated at Nelakondapalli
village, Khammam District from 1987 to 2001 and June, 2006 to
June, 2007.  Secondly to direct the respondents to re-deliver the
19 shops situated at Nelakondapalli, Khammam District to the
complainant.  Thirdly to direct the respondents not to sell 19
shops belonging to the complainant situated at Nelakondapalli
village, near Kodada, Nalgonda Dsitrict, Fourthly, to direct the
respondents to handover the custody of Ms.Gowthami and  
Master Pavan Sai Mohan to the complainant. Fifthly to direct the
respondents to pay a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation and  
damages for mental torture and emotional distress caused by the
respondents by committing acts of domestic violence caused to
the complainant for the last 20 years..  Lastly to direct the
respondents to pay a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- towards medical 
expenses incurred by the complainant for the treatment of her
husband. 
     11.        The main objection of the respondents is to attract
the provisions of Act, 2005. Complainant has to first show that
she is the aggrieved person and secondly, the property claimed
by her is a shared house.  Section 2 (a) of Act, 2005 defined
aggrieved person which reads as follows:
       aggrieved person means any woman who is, or has
been, in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who
alleges to have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by
the respondent.
     12.  A plain reading of the above definition makes it clear
that there shall be domestic relationship between the
complainant and respondents to treat the complainant as
aggrieved person.
     13.        Shared house hold is defined in Section 2 (s) of the
Act, 2005 which reads as follows:
       shared household means a household where the
person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in the domestic
relationship either singly or along with the respondent and
includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either
jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned or
tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the
aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have
any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a household
which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is
a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the
aggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the shared
household.
     14.        From a reading of the above definition, it is clear
that the aggrieved person must live in the property in domestic
relationship either singly or along with the respondents and
there shall be right, title, interest or equity in that property which
may belong to the joint family of which respondent is a member.
To attract this, the complainant has to show that the property
claimed in this petition is the joint family property and that her
husband has got a share in the said property.
     15.        Honourable Supreme Court in VIMLABEN AJITBHAI
PATEL Vs. VATSLABEN ASHOKBHAI PATEL ( ) held as follows:       
     It is not for an owner of the property to establish that it is
self- acquired property and the onus would be on the one, who
pleads contra.
     16.         Here the contention of the complainant is that the
13 shops at Nelakondapalli are the joint family property and at
the time of marriage, it was promised that these shops would be
given to her husband, but as seen from the documents, filed on
behalf of the respondents, this property stands in the name of
second respondent and it was purchased long prior to the
marriage.  Admittedly, marriage of complainant with
Narendrababu was performed in the year 1987 whereas this 
Nelakondapalli property was purchased in the year 1977 by
second respondent. 
     17.        According to complainant, they collected rents from
these shops in their own right, but according to respondents,
because of their affection towards husband of complainant, they
allowed Narendrababu to collect rents from these shops taking
into consideration his financial position.  According to
complainant rent receipts issued by tenants are not considered by
the trial court and those documents are supporting her claim.
Here the respondents filed material to show that the shop stands
in the name of second respondent and they have only permitted
husband of complainant to collect rents for some period.  Even
from the averments of the petition filed on behalf of the
complainant, they collected rent only after 2001 though their
marriage was in the year 1987.  If really husband of complainant
had a right or share in the property, they would have collected
these rents from 1987 onwards.  From the decision of
Honourable Supreme Court referred above, burden is on the
complainant to prove that the property in dispute is a joint
family property.  As rightly pointed out by advocate for
respondents, these  rent receipts would no way confer any title
on the property particularly when second respondent contended
that he allowed late Nagendrabababu to collect rents from these
shops which is substantiated from circumstances these rent
receipts do not have any evidentiary value.
     18.        Under the provisions of Act, 2005, aggrieved person
can claim the relief of share envisaged in Sections 17, 18, 19, 20,
21 and 22.  Under these sections, no right is created for an
aggrieved person to claim arrears of rent or possession of
disputed property.  Even for claiming the reliefs under the above
referred sections, the aggrieved person must prima facie
establish that there is domestic violence as contemplated under
Section 3 of the Act. This Court in KUPPILI SRIDHAR KUMAR   
AND OTHERS Vs.KUPPILI SIVA SANTOSHI AND ANOTHER ( )           
held as follows:
      One of the main ingredients which has to be prima facie
established before claiming reliefs under the provisions of the
said Act is that there should be domestic violence as
contemplated under Section 3 of the Act.
     19.        A reading of the complaint, the allegation against
respondents is that husband of the complainant was suffering
with ailment of mental disorder even prior to the marriage and
suppressing the same, her marriage was performed.  Except 
making vague allegation in the complaint, there is absolutely no
material of any kind to support the version of the complainant.
On the other hand, it is the contention of the respondents that
because of the attitude of the complainant and her adulterous
life, her husband became upset and developed mental disorder
and he was hale and healthy prior to the marriage.  Material on
record, prima facie, show that the complainant is accustomed to
lead luxurious life and she was moving closely with some men
and she closely moved with one Anil Kumar, an L.I.C. agent and
she was living in adultery with that person. Complainants own
daughter gave a detailed affidavit about her close movements
with the said Anil Kumar and her adulterous life.  Though the
complainant contended that her daughters mind and her sons
mind are polluted, the same cannot be accepted because no 
daughter would go to the extent of making a statement with
regard to chastity of her own mother.
     20.        One of the contentions of the respondents is that
complainant without any material, on vague allegations,
involved all the family members of her husband after his death
and the present lis is nothing but abuse of process of beneficial
legislation.
     21.        Learned counsel for the respondents relied on a
decision of this court in BURAVILLI SIVA MADHURI Vs.  
BURAVILLI SATYA VENKATA LAKSHMANA RAO AND ORS.( ),             
whereunder this court held as follows:
      If a person is made to face criminal trial on
some general and sweeping allegations without
bringing on record any specific instances of criminal
conduct, it is nothing but abuse of process of court.
The court has to subject the allegations levelled in the
complaint to thorough scrutiny to find out prima facie
whether there is any ring of truth in the allegations or
whether they are made only with the sole object of
involving certain individuals in a criminal charge,
ultimately to make them to face endless criminal
prosecutions. To prevent abuse of process of court and
to save the innocent from the false prosecutions at the
hands of unscrupulous litigants, the criminal
proceedings, if they appear to be frivolous and false
have to be quashed at the threshold.

     22.        From the averments of the complaint, it is clear that
the respondents are residing at different places.  First respondent
is mother-in-law of complainant, second respondent is elder
brother of complainants husband, third respondent is sister of
complainants husband and fourth respondent is husband of
third respondent.  There is no prima facie material to show how
these persons would fall within the meaning of respondent as
defined under Section 2 (q) of Act, 2005.
     23.        As per the definition, respondent means, any adult
male person who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with
the aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved person 
has sought any relief under this Act.
       24.      There is no whisper in the complaint how these
respondents have a domestic relationship with the complainant.
The entire case of the complainant is in respect of Nelakondapalli
property.  As already observed supra, the relief in respect of that
property as claimed by complainant is not available under the
Act, 2005 and remedy of the complainant is only in civil court.
So when the petition itself is not maintainable, implicating all the
family members of her late husband, is definitely abuse of
process of court.
     25.        The other reliefs of the complainant is for custody of
the children.  Now from the submissions of the advocate for
respondents, both children have attained majority and the relief
for the custody has become infructuous.  It appears that both the
children are now married and the marriage expenses of the
daughter were born out by the 3rd respondent who is the
paternal aunt of the girl.
     26.        One of the contentions of the respondents is that this
property do not come under the definition of shared house and
there is no material produced on behalf of complainant to show
that at least prima facie this Nelakondapalli property would fall
under the definition of a shared house.
     27.        The Honourable Supreme court in S.R.BATRA AND
ANOTHER Vs. TARUNA BATRA ( ) held as follows:     
      The house in question belongs to the mother-in-law of
the respondent. It does not belong to her husband.  Hence, the
respondent cannot claim any right to live in that house.  There is
no such law in India, like the British Matrimonial Homes, Act,
1967 and in any case, the rights which may be available under
any law can only be as against the husband and not against the
father-in-law or mother-in-law.

     28.  It is  also held in that decision as follows:
      Wife is only entitled to claim a right under
section 17(1) to residence in a shared household and
a shared household would only mean the house  
belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the
house which belongs to the joint family of which the
husband is a member.  The property in question in the
present case neither belongs to the respondents
husband nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a
joint family property.

     29.        In this case, from prima facie material it is shown
that disputed property is self acquired property of second
respondent who is the brother of complainants husband,
therefore, it cannot be treated as shared household.  Further
subsequent to this litigation property of Nelakondapalli is gifted
to the children by the 2nd respondent on 30-6-2009 through
two separate registered documents.  This shows the concern of
respondents towards the children of late Nagenderababu.
     30.        The other reliefs are for compensation of 20 lakhs
for the loss of life of complainants husband.  There is no material
to show that her husband was not sound prior to the marriage
and that the respondents caused mental torture to the
complainant by suppressing such material fact.  On the other
hand, material prima facie discloses that husband of complainant
is fed up with the attitude of the complainant and suffered
mental agony and disorder on account of her adulterous life.
     31.        The next claim of the complaint is that she is entitled
to recover Rs.50,00,000/- from the respondents which she has
spent towards medical expenses of her husband.  Absolutely, no
material is placed for the alleged medical expenses incurred for
the treatment of her husband.  She has not filed any documents
and she has not produced any record either for the treatment or
for the ailment.
     32.        Learned Magistrate has elaborately discussed each
and every aspect of the matter and dismissed the petition by a
reasoned order.  But the learned Sessions Judge without looking
into these aspects, simply carried away with the submissions of
the complainant that she was not given an opportunity to prove
the documents that are filed without going into the relevancy of
those documents in a domestic violence petition.  As per the
provisions of the Act, the proceedings have to be held in camera
and to be tried summarily.  According to the provisions of the
Act, time fixed is 60 days for disposal from the date of the first
hearing.  This Act is to provide speedy remedy for deserving
aggrieved person and for that reason, a summary enquiry is
contemplated  The court in a domestic violence petition cannot
go into the title dispute and relief of the complainant and the
documents sought to be relied on in this case are in respect of
title dispute.  On a scrutiny of the material, I am of the view
benefits of the Act, 2005 are not to protect a lady like
complainant who by her adulterous life caused mental agony
and family disorder both for husband and children.  Therefore,
learned Sessions Judge has committed error in setting aside the
well reasoned order of the learned III Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad.
     33.        For the reasons stated above, this Criminal Revision
Case is allowed and the impugned order of the V Additional
Sessions Judge, Hyderabad is set aside confirming the order of the
III Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad.
Consequently, the dismissal of the D.V.C. No.11 of 2007 by the
trial court is upheld.
     34.        As a sequel to the disposal of this revision, the
Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, pending, shall stand dismissed.

JUSTICE S.RAVI KUMAR     
Dated 29-4-2014.

 Dated:   03/09/2010

:  JUDGEMENT   


   Appeal under Section 19  1  of the Family Courts Act  1984

  The  following  judgment of the Court was  passed  by  T.P.

Sharma, J: -

1.   Challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 25-2-2010

  passed by the Judge, Family Court, Bilaspur in Misc. Criminal

  Case  No.592/2005, whereby learned Judge, Family Court  has 

  awarded  monetary relief of Rs.3,000/- per month  and  Rs.5

  lakhs  as  one time payment under Sections 19 &amp; 22  of  the

  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,  2005  (for

  short `the Act of 2005'), to the respondent.


2.    Order  is impugned on the ground that the Judge, Family

  Court was not having jurisdiction to award such relief and by

  awarding such relief, the Judge, Family Court has committed

  illegality.


3.    Brief  case  of  the parties is that  the  parties  are

  legally  wedded  spouses and as per the  application  filed

  before  the Judge, Family Court, Bilaspur on behalf of  the

  respondent, originally the respondent has claimed maintenance

  of  Rs.5,000/- per month under Section 125 of the  Code  of

  Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short `the Code') against the

  appellant.  The claim was denied by the appellant.   During

  the  pendency of the proceeding, the respondent  has  filed

  application under Sections 17, 18, 19, 20, 22 &amp; 26 of the Act

  of  2005 read with Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984

  (for short `the Act of 1984') for grant of monetary relief in

  terms of Section 20 of the Act of 2005.  The application was

  objected   by  the  appellant.   Finally,  after  providing

  opportunity  of  hearing, the Judge,  Family  Court,  while

  dismissing the application filed under Section 125  of  the

  Code, granted aforesaid monetary relief under Sections 19 &amp;

  22 of the Act of 2005.


4.    We  have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused

  the order impugned and record of the Court below.


5.   Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that

  in  the  present  case,  the Judge, Family  Court  was  not

  competent to grant any relief under the provisions of the Act

  of  2005 and only the Magistrate concerned was competent to

  grant relief under the provisions of the Act of 2005 may be

  in  addition to any relief granted in any legal  proceeding

  pending  before the Civil Court, Family Court  or  Criminal

  Court.  However, in the present case, the Judge, Family Court

  was  not having jurisdiction, but has granted such monetary

  relief and, therefore, the order impugned is not sustainable

  under the law.  Learned counsel further argued that the Act

  of   2005  came  into  force  on  26-10-2006  and  is   not

  retrospective.  Therefore, even otherwise, the Family Court

  is not competent to grant any relief for the act committed by

  the  parties  prior  to enforcement of the  aforesaid  Act.

  Learned counsel placed reliance in the matter of Shyamlal &amp;

  others  v.  Kanta  Bai1 in which the High Court  of  Madhya

  Pradesh has held that the Act of 2005 is not retrospective,

  therefore,  the  parties are not entitled  for  any  relief

  relating to the act committed prior to enforcement  of  the

  Act.


6.    On  the  other hand, learned counsel for the respondent

  vehemently  opposed  the  appeal  and  submitted  that   no

  provisions for appeal to High Court have been provided under

  the  Act of 2005 and, therefore, the instant appeal is  not

maintainable.  The Legislature has provided for appeal  under

  the  Act  of  2005  that  too before  the  Sessions  Judge,

  therefore,  appeal  before this  Court  is  not  competent.

  Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance  in  the

  matter  of  Smt. Neetu Singh v. Sunil Singh2 in which  this

  Court has held that any application under Section 12 of the

  Act of 2005 is not maintainable before the Family Court and

  is only maintainable before the concerned Magistrate.


7.     Vide  order  impugned,  while  denying  the  claim  of

  maintenance of the respondent under Section 125 of the Code

  on the ground of her ability to maintain herself, the Judge,

  Family  Court has awarded monetary relief to the respondent

  under Sections 19 &amp; 22 of the Act of 2005.  Section 19 of the

  Act  of 2005 does not provide provision for maintenance  or

  grant of compensation, but clause (d) of sub-section (1) of

  Section  20  of  the  Act  of 2005 provides  provision  for

  maintenance  in  addition to an order of maintenance  under

  Section  125  of the Code.  Section 22 of the Act  of  2005

  provides for award of compensation on account of damages for

  the   injuries,  including  mental  torture  and  emotional

  distress, caused by the acts of domestic violence committed

  by  that respondent.  Para 41 of the order impugned reveals

  that impliedly the appellant has committed domestic violence

  and has caused mental torture and emotional distress to the

  respondent.   Sections 20 &amp; 22 of the Act of 2005  read  as

  follows: -

          "20. Monetary reliefs.-(1) While disposing of
          an   application  under  sub-section  (1)  of
          Section  12,  the Magistrate may  direct  the
          respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the
          expenses incurred and losses suffered by  the
          aggrieved  person  and  any  child   of   the
          aggrieved person as a result of the  domestic
          violence and such relief may include, but  is
          not limited to,--
               (a)  the loss of earnings;
(b)  the medical expenses;
(c)  the loss caused due to the destruction, damage or
removal of any property from the control of the aggrieved
person; and
(d)  the maintenance for the aggrieved person as well as her
children, if any, including an order under or in addition to
an order of maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 to 1974) or any other law for the
time being in force.
            (2)     The  monetary relief granted  under
          this  section  shall  be adequate,  fair  and
          reasonable  and consistent with the  standard
          of  living  to which the aggrieved person  is
          accustomed.
            (3) The Magistrate shall have the power  to
          order  an  appropriate lump  sum  payment  or
          monthly  payments  of  maintenance,  as   the
          nature  and  circumstances of  the  case  may
          require.
            (4)  The  Magistrate shall send a  copy  of
          the order for monetary relief made under sub-
          section (1) to the parties to the application
          and  to  the  incharge of the police  station
          within the local limits of whose jurisdiction
          the respondent resides.
            (5)  The  respondent shall pay the monetary
          relief granted to the aggrieved person within
          the  period specified in the order under sub-
          section (1).
            (6)  Upon  the failure on the part  of  the
          respondent  to make payment in terms  of  the
          order  under sub-section (1), the  Magistrate
          may  direct the employer or a debtor  of  the
          respondent, to directly pay to the  aggrieved
          person or to deposit with the Court a portion
          of  the wages or salaries or debt due  to  or
          accrued  to  the  credit of  the  respondent,
          which  amount  may  be adjusted  towards  the
          monetary relief payable by the respondent.

          22. Compensation orders.-In addition to other
          reliefs as may be granted under this Act, the
          Magistrate  may on an application being  made
          by   the  aggrieved  person,  pass  an  order
          directing  the respondent to pay compensation
          and   damages  for  the  injuries,  including
          mental torture and emotional distress, caused
          by the acts of domestic violence committed by
          that respondent."

8.     Definitely,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of

  Sections 20 &amp; 22 of the Act of 2005, the Court competent to

  grant such relief is competent to award monthly maintenance

  in addition to an order passed under Section 125 of the Code

  and also competent to award compensation on account of mental 

  torture and emotional distress caused by the appellant.


9.   As regards competency to grant such relief by the Family

  Court,  the Family Courts Act, 1984 (66 of 1984) came  into

  force in the undivided State of Madhya Pradesh on 19-11-1986

  vide  notification  No.79/6/86  dated  14-11-1986  and  the

  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (No.43 

  of 2005) came into force on 26-10-2006.


10.   As  per  Section  26  of the Act of  2005,  any  relief

  available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Act of

  2005, may also be sought in any legal proceeding, before  a

  Civil Court, Family Court or a Criminal Court.  Section 12 of

  the Act of 2005 provides for filing of an application by an

  aggrieved person before the Magistrate competent  to  grant

  such relief, but if any legal proceeding is pending before a

  Civil Court, Family Court or a Criminal Court relating to any

  relief which may be available to the person concerned under

  Sections  18,  19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Act of  2005,  such

  relief may be sought in such legal proceeding.


11.  While dealing with same question, this Court has decided

  that independent application under Section 12 of the Act of

  2005  is not maintainable before the Family Court, but  the

  application for grant of relief available under Sections 18,

  19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Act of 2005 is maintainable before a

  Civil Court, Family Court or a Criminal Court in any pending

  proceeding.


12.   Admittedly, the respondent has filed application before

  the Family Court in pending proceeding of Section 125 of the

  Code.   Therefore, the Family Court was competent  to  pass

  order in terms of Section 26 of the Act of 2005.


13.   As regards competency of this appeal, as per Section 29

  of  the  Act  of 2005, the order made by the Magistrate  is

  appealable  before the Court of Sessions.  In  the  present

  case, the Magistrate has not passed any order and the Judge,

  Family Court has passed the order impugned under Section 26 

  of  the Act of 2005.  The order passed by the Judge, Family

  Court is appealable under sub-section (1) of Section 19  of

  the Act of 1984.  Sub-section (2) of Section 19 of the Act of

  1984 creates bar in filing appeal relating to consent order

  or  any  order  passed under Chapter IX of  the  Code  i.e.

  relating  to maintenance.  The order impugned has not  been

  passed under Chapter IX of the Code or is not a consent order

  and, therefore, appeal under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of

  the Act of 1984 is competent.


14.   As  regards  competency of the order in  the  light  of

  prospective  operation of the Act of 2005,  the  expression

  "aggrieved person" is defined in clause (a) of Section 2 of

  the Act of 2005 which reads as under: -

          "aggrieved person" means any woman who is, or
          has been, in a domestic relationship with the
          respondent  and  who  alleges  to  have  been
          subjected to any act of domestic violence  by
          the respondent;

15.   In  accordance  with the definition of  the  expression

  "aggrieved  person", any woman who is, or has  been,  in  a

  domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges to

  have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by  the

  respondent is an aggrieved person.  It includes any woman who

  has been subjected to any act of domestic violence.


16.   As  per claim of the parties, the respondent is  not  a

  divorcee wife and marriage between the parties has not been

  dissolved by decree of divorce prior to enforcement of  the

  Act of 2005 which may disentitle the respondent from claiming

  any  relief under the Act of 2005 on the ground that  after

  enforcement  of  the  Act of 2005, the  appellant  has  not

  committed any torture or has not caused emotional distress,

  still the respondent is legally wedded wife of the appellant

  and is residing separately.  The Family Court has considered

  the  factum  of mental torture and emotional distress.   In

  these  circumstances,  the Judge,  Family  Court  was  also

  competent to pass order under Sections 20 &amp; 22 of the Act of

  2005.


17.    As  regards  the  amount  of  maintenance  and  award,

  considering the ability of the appellant, the Judge, Family

  Court has awarded maintenance of Rs.3,000/- per month to the

  respondent.  Virtually, under Section 20 (1) (d) of the Act

  of 2005, the appellant was under obligation to maintain his

  wife in dignified manner, but instead of maintaining her, the

  appellant  has  deserted  her.   Therefore,  the  award  of

  maintenance of Rs.3,000/- per month under Section 20 (1) (d)

  of the Act of 2005 is neither excessive nor unjust.


18.   As regards the compensation of Rs.5 lakhs under Section

  22  of  the Act of 2005, the respondent has not proved  any

  immovable  property or definite source  of  income  of  the

  appellant  on  the ground of mental torture  and  emotional

  distress.  The Judge, Family Court has awarded compensation 

  of  Rs.5 lakhs.  At the time of awarding compensation,  the

  Courts   are   required   to   consider   all   surrounding

  circumstances.   As  per evidence of the parties,  marriage

  between the parties was solemnized on 28-4-2003, they resided

  together  till 16-9-2004 and they are issueless.  Both  the

  parties  have  made allegations against  each  other.   The

  appellant was in dominating position and was under obligation

  to  maintain  his wife in dignified manner.   However,  the

  appellant has failed to discharge his aforesaid obligation.

  In these circumstances, definitely, the appellant is liable

  for payment of compensation to the respondent under Section

  22 of the Act of 2005, but the amount of compensation of Rs.5

  lakhs  is not only excessive and unjust, but award of  such

  compensation  is  arbitrary.   At  the  time  of   awarding

  compensation,  the Courts are required to grant  reasonable

  compensation.  Considering the aforesaid facts, compensation

  of Rs.50,000/- under Section 22 of the Act of 2005 would be

  just and proper.


19.     Consequently,   the   appeal   is   partly   allowed.

  Compensation  of Rs.5 lakhs awarded against  the  appellant

  under Section 22 of the Act of 2005 is hereby modified  and

  instead  of  Rs.5  lakhs the appellant is directed  to  pay

  compensation of Rs.50,000/- to the respondent.  However, the

  amount of maintenance of Rs.3,000/- per month awarded to the

  respondent under Section 20 (1) (d) of the Act of  2005  is

  hereby maintained.  No order as to costs.


20.  Advocate fees as per schedule.


21.  Decree be drawn up accordingly.

                                   JUDGE

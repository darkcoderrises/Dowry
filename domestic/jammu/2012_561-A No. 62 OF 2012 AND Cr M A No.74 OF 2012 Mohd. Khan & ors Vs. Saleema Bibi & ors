JUDGMENT    
The Jammu and Kashmir Protection of Women    
from Domestic Violence Act, 2010 was enacted to 
provide more effective protection of the rights of
women guaranteed to them under the Constitution who  
were victims of violence of any kind occurring within
the family and for matters connected thereto or
incidental thereto. Reiterating and explaining the rights
of women, who are related by consanguinity, marriage,
adoption or as joint family members, Chapter IV of the
Act provides procedure for obtaining and making of
orders contemplated under the Act.
2
Applications filed under Chapter IV of the Act are
required to be disposed of by a Judicial Magistrate
empowered to entertain such Applications within a
period of sixty days from the date of first hearing
taking up the matter after every three (03) days. The
scheme of the Act, however, does not provide for
punishment to person(s) accused of Domestic Violence. 
Its purpose, on the other hand, appears providing
protection to those suffering from Domestic Violence.
Chapter V of the Act, however, contemplates
punishment of imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to one year or with fine which
may extend to Rs.20,000/- or with both for those who
are found to have committed breach of the Protection
Order or any Interim Protection Order, passed during
the currency of the proceedings under the Act.
The Magistrate empowered to entertain grievance
against Domestic Violence may pass such orders after 
following the procedure prescribed under the Act,
which includes opportunity of hearing to the person(s)
accused of Domestic Violence. The Court may, if
required, formulate its own procedure while dealing
with Applications under Sections 12 or 23(2) of the
Act.
3
Considering the issues raised by learned counsel
for the parties in this Petition, in the backdrop of above
indicated legal position, learned Municipal Mobile
Magistrate (Ist Civil Subordinate Judge), Jammu, is
found to have erred in treating the respondents
Application a Complaint and the petitioners accused.
Rather than issuing requisite notice to petitioners and
hearing them in the matter, in terms of the provisions of
the Act, learned Magistrate has unnecessarily protracted
the proceedings on respondents Application, in issuing
process and warrants against the petitioners as if he was
dealing with a Complaint for commission of any
offence. Order dated 14.02.2012 passed by him treating
the respondents Application as Complaint and finding
the petitioners as accused, cannot, therefore, be
sustained.
Petitioners learned counsels submission that
there was no case for initiation of proceedings against
the petitioners under the Jammu and Kashmir 
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,  
2010, need not be examined by this Court, in that,
similar pleas raised in the objections filed by the
petitioners to the respondents Application needs to be
4
considered initially by the Magistrate seized of the
Application.
Order dated 14.02.2012 of the learned Magistrate
issuing process against the petitioner is, accordingly, set
aside and he is directed to dispose of respondents
Application following the procedure prescribed under
Chapter IV of the Act. Learned Magistrate is directed to
take up respondents Application for consideration
every week, if his Board may not otherwise permit him
to take it twice a week, ensuring that proceedings were
concluded preferably within two months.
Parties through their learned counsel are directed
to appear before learned Municipal Mobile Magistrate
(Ist Civil Subordinate Judge), Jammu on December 20,
2012.

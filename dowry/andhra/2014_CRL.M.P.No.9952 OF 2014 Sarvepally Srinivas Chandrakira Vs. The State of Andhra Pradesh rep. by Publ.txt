THE HONOURABLE Dr. JUSTICE B.SIVA SANKARA RAO            
CRL.M.P.No.9952 of 2014 in Crl.P.No.9493 of 2012 

ORDER:  

      1) This miscellaneous petition is filed by the petitioner/accused
under Section 482 Cr.P.C seeking to release the passport duly relaxing
the condition of surrendering the passport of the petitioner as stipulated
in the order dated 30.10.2012 in Crl.M.P.No.5172 of 2012 in Crime
No.418 of 2012 on the file of the Court of the Special Judicial Magistrate
of the First Class for Prohibition and Excise, Guntur.
      2) Brief facts are that the petitioner is the 1st accused and
husband of the defacto-complainant of the above crime registered
against him among other family members for the offences punishable
under Sections 498-A I.P.C and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition
Act.  It appears charge sheet filed by the police and the case was taken
cognizance and the accused was examined on the charges framed   
against him and others under Section 240 Cr.P.C and coming for trial.
Earlier, while granting bail to this petitioner, one of the conditions
imposed on the petitioner is to deposit the passport and the same was
subsequently deposited in the trial Court and subsequently, this Court
permitted the petitioner/A-1 to take back the passport which is in
deposit with Court for his going abroad to U.S.A and to return within six
months and to re-deposit the same vide order dated 31.12.2012 in
Crl.P.No.9493 of 2012.  It is now again seeking such permission by this
application with averments that he intend to appear for career
progression and he applied for IDP under IELTS and as per the terms and
conditions of IELTS the original passport has to be produced as proof of
identification for appearing to the test that is scheduled to be
conducted at Hyderabad on 06.09.2014 and without production of the
original passport and submitting copy of it, they could not entertain him
to participate in the test which is very important for his career
progression.
      3) Heard and perused the material on record.
      4) As per the Apex Courts guidelines in Siddharam Satlingappa
Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra  as part of the conditions of the bail
besides property title deeds required to be deposited including bank
accounts and deposit of even the passport of accused before the learned
Magistrate though there are expressions in Suresh Nanda V. Central
Bureau of Investigation  and in Gian Singh V. State of Rajasthan
saying that the investigating officials have no right of their own to
impound the passport, but for the passport officials under the provisions
of the Indian Passport Act, 1967.  Here, the impounding the passport by
investigating officers is entirely different from seeking to deposit the
passport by the Court as one of the conditions of the bail to see that the
accused shall not jump the bail or from the clutches of the Justice of
Law by using or misusing the passport even there is a bar under Section
6(2)(f) of the Indian Passport Act, 1967 of any person who is accused of
crime in India, passport cannot be obtained and travel beyond the
country without prior permission and there is a circular of the Central
Government in GSR 570E, dated 25.08.1993 as per Section 22 of the  
Passport Act issued by the Ministry of External Affairs in the public
interest that by said notification exempting the citizens of India against
whom criminal proceedings are pending in India without facing any
hardship for their requirement to travel abroad, a permission of the
concerned Magistrate, where the case is pending for travel abroad.
      5) No doubt in the earlier order, these aspects were not
considered.  However, coming to the present prayer, it is only to attend
a test sought for at Hyderabad that is conducting by the foreign country
in which as one of the conditions is to submit the original passport for
verification and  give a photocopy of the same for retention and the
passport required is for the said purpose.
      6) Having regard to the above by imposing a condition that he
shall execute a bond that he shall not misuse the order now granting for
return of the passport to travel beyond the country with that passport,
he shall attend to the purpose for which the permission is accorded for
such test being conducted on 06.09.2014 and return back the passport
and for that he shall execute along with an affidavit in the form of a
bond for Rs.20,000/- with one surety of cash or bank deposit or property
security as the case may be.
      7) Accordingly, with the above conditions, this petition is allowed.

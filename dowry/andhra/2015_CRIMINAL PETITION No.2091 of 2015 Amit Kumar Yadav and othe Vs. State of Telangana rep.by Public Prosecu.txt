3.              The brief facts of the case from the police report as
well as the investigation material in nut-shell is that the
marriage of the petitioner/A-1 was performed on 22-06-2004
in Charan Paduka Kutir, Barhalganj, Gorakhpur as per

Sections 498-A IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition
Act against four accused.  Of whom, A-1 is husband of de

Centenary colony, Kamanpur Mandal, Karimnagar District. 
LWs.2 and 3 among eight witnesses shown in the charge sheet  
are father and mother of LW.1, LWs 4 and 5 are brothers of
LW.1 and LW.6 is the neighbour of her house.
4.              The gist of the complaint report dated 04-01-2014,
which is a private complaint filed before the Learned
Magistrate, Manthani referred for police investigation under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. thereafter in registering the crime later
supra in nut shell that after the marriage performed at
Gorakhpur of Uttarpradesh, besides what her parents
presented of 4.00 lakhs dowry with 8 tolas of gold and other
house hold articles including a bike worth Rs.2,00,000/- in
meeting demand for marriage, the accused persons about one  
year after happy marital life in the wedlock started harassing
physically and mentally for additional dowry of Rs.1,00,000/-
by abusing in filthy and offensive language in saying she is not
looking well and beat her indiscriminately and even her father
to the demand paid Rs.20,000/- to A-1 with no change even
after panchayaths held and assurances were made from their 
side to treat well, that even on 04-01-2013 she was beaten
with stick and sustained head injury and she was necked out
by snatching gold ornaments with wearing cloths and apparel
and they threatened with dire consequences and demanding  
through phone for additional dowry and that on 30-06-2013 all
the accused visited her parents house at Kamanpur at about
5.30 pm for discussions and started abusing her in filthy
language demanding additional dowry and beat, with kitchen
knife threatened and she approached Kamanpur police station 
and the police advised to take the matter before elders but
invain.  The police final report from the said report registered
as crime supra reads that LW.7 Investigating Officer who
registered the crime made efforts to secure presence of
accused to counsel them but invain and took up investigation
by LW.7 and LW.8 by examination of LWs 2 to 6.  It revealed
all the accused are residents of Shastry Nagar in Uttar Pradesh
harassed LW.1 physically and mentally for additional dowry
and ultimately on 04-01-2013 she was beaten and necked out 
from their matrimonial house and from there she is residing at
her parents house and later all accused continued their
harassment through phone calls for additional dowry and came
to parents house of the de facto complainant on 30-06-2013
for discussions and abused in filthy language and thereby
committed the offences supra liable for punishment.
5.      Not even a single witness examined from the place of
the accused as the marriage performed at Gorakhpur of Uttar
Pradesh and the de facto complainant after marriage lived till
alleged necked out by the accused from the matrimonial
house at Shastrinagar, Kanpur or at Gorakpur both in Uttar
Pradesh or on 04-01-2013 even investigation no where
discloses what are the phone calls she received and from
which number to which number even to create any part of
cause of action on the receiving  information of phone calls
within the jurisdiction of Kamanpur of Karimnagar District
much less to say on 30-06-2013 allegedly all the accused
persons went to the parents house of de facto complainant at
Kamanpur for negotiations to take back in support of alleged
incident.
6.              The de facto complainant even served, did not choose
to appear.  All the witnesses are apart from interested
nothing is of any independent evidence material collected
during investigation. It is knowing apart from allegation of she
was necked out on 04-01-2013 even taken for argument sake, 
the allegation of accused came to her parents place on 30-06-
2013, what made her not to give any written report much less
by registered post to the Police Superintendent as
contemplated by Section 154 Cr.P.C. till the so-called
de facto complainant filed complaint dated 04-01-2014 in
waiting for more than six months to the alleged incident set
up within the jurisdiction of Kamanpur.  There is no any copy
of the police report given if at all to the police who
investigated in the final report not even mentioned about her
giving of report earlier and why not crime registered and any
further action is taken, for there is any little truth the
respondent even served failed to attend before the Court and
thereby the Court taken as heard her and heard learned
counsel for the petitioners as well as the 1st respondent-State.
7.      Perused the material filed by the accused persons in
support of the quash petition shows there is marriage
conciliation deed of 22-03-2013 at Godavarikani between the
parties and there is a settlement between the parties
executed on Rs.50/-non-judicial stamp in the panchayath held
at her in-laws place regarding divorce deed
 dated 22-03-2013.  The said settlement deed speaks that
LW.2 none other than the father of de facto complainant
Deenanath Yadav executed the settlement deed in Gorakpur  
in the in-laws place of his daughter mentioning his daughter
Geeta Devi w/o.Amit Kumar Yadav of their marriage
performed at her in-laws place on 22-06-2004, they could not
lead happy marital life because of differences occurred
leading to strained relations and not able to live together and
the panchayath held in the presence of Village Pradhan and
reputed persons representing both sides on 04-06-2014 at
Primary School ground Misrauli and they reached to a
conclusion that  household goods, cash and other items which
were given by him at the time of marriage of his daughter
viz., Rs.63,500/-, one gold ring, one gold chain (Mala),
Mangalsutra(gold), gold ring, Nose pin gold, Heavy Payal
(silver), Thin Payal (silver), Half Kardhan (silver), Nickles gold,
ear ring (gold), Gold tika and nose pin handed over to him as
per the divorce settlement and from the divorce deed
executed dated 22-03-2013 prepared at Godavarikhani and 
pursuant to which the items are handed over including the
cash and in acknowledgment of what was received by the 
parties also under taken not to initiate any legal proceedings
against each other and it is signed in all by 12 persons.  The
photo is also filed showing LW.2 taking items that were
handed over by the accused persons and the documents   
executed exchanged as one of the enclosures.  In fact, the
de facto complainant suppressed the same and filed private
complaint subsequent to the divorce deed on 04-06-2014 and 
even after the divorce deed and the private complaint, there
was settlement and the items of property received by the
father of defacto complainant and executed the document
regarding the panchayaths held on 04-06-2014 reiterating the
divorce deed arrived at Godavarikhani at her parents place to
them on 22-03-2013.  This is a material fact of existing earlier
divorce deed that is suppressed by the de facto complainant
and once the disputes are settled amicably as per the deed,
criminal prosecution that too by suppressing the fact is
nothing but an abuse of process as laid down by the catena of
decisions including the judgment of SJS Business Enterprises
v. State of Bihar .  It is held in para 13 of the said judgment
as under:
".... As a general rule, suppression of a material fact by a
litigant disqualifies such litigant from obtaining any relief.
This rule has been evolved out of need of the courts to
deter a litigant from abusing the process of court by
deceiving it. But the suppressed fact must be a material
one in the sense that had it not been suppressed it would
have an effect on the merits of the case.
8.  This Court also in this regard dealt in detail in
Crl.P.No.5324 of 2015 dated 01-09-2015 by referring to catena
of decisions including Division Bench of this Court in Inder Raj
Agarwal v. Union of India .  Thus the complaint filed by the de
facto complainant that was referred to the police
investigation by the Magistrate and the police final report
filed pursuant thereto is the outcome from the suppression of
material fact of earlier deed of divorce between the de facto
complainant and A-1 through elders amicably and the same 
reiterated referring in the settlement executed immediately
after 04-06-2014 some settlement arrived earlier at
Godavarikhani of Karimnagar District also from the
panchayhath held and pursuant to which, the items belongs to
the de facto complainant and her father lying with accused
persons were also returned, the continuation of criminal
proceedings there is nothing but abuse of process as held in
expressions referred supra as it is a fit case to quash the
calender case.  It is also needless to say as held in Y.Abraham
Ajith v. Inspector of Police, Chennai   that the complaint itself
discloses while the de facto complainant residing with accused
at his place and came out from there i.e. the main cause of
action besides marriage in occurring some cause of action to
maintain the complainant at her place of parents not
sustainable by referring to Section 177 and 178 Cr.P.C.
9.                      For all these reasons and having regard to the above,
the Criminal Petition is allowed and thereby, the proceedings
in C.C.No.150 of 2014 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First
Class, Manthani, Karimnagar District are hereby quashed.
Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending in this Criminal
Petition, shall stand closed.

O.S.A.Nos.10 & 11 OF 2015   


COMMON JUDGMENT: (Per Honble Sri Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)        
        
      Aggrieved by the order passed in C.A. No.1163 of 2013 in
C.P. No.30 of 2012 dated 25.03.2015, the 2nd respondent therein
has filed O.S.A. No.10 of 2015.  O.S.A. No.11 of 2015 is filed by the
3rd respondent in C.A. No.1163 of 2013 in C.P. No.30 of 2012,
aggrieved by the very same order passed on 25.03.2015.  As both
the appeals are preferred against the very same order, by Sri
Samson Arthur and Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao (appellants in 
O.S.A. No.10 and 11 of 2015 respectively), they were heard
together, and are being disposed of by a common order.  Parties
shall, hereinafter, be referred to as they are arrayed in these
appeals.
      C.A. No.1163 of 2013 was filed by the respondent- company
herein i.e., Quinn Logistics India Pvt. Ltd, (hereinafter referred to
as QLI), represented by its Director and Authorised Signatory Mr.
Robert Dix, under Rule 9 of the Company Court Rules read with
Section 340 Cr.P.C. and Sections 191, 192, 193 and 209 I.P.C,
seeking an enquiry against both the appellants herein for making
false statements on oath, for fabricating documents, for
suppressing material facts, and for admitting liability of the
respondent-company, in collusion with M/s. R.N. Marwah & 
Company (the petitioner in C.P. No.30 of 2012), in order to cause
injury to the respondent-company; and thereby committing
offences punishable under Sections 191, 192, 193 read with
Section 209 IPC.  The respondent-company requested the Learned  
Company Judge to direct a complaint to be registered against Sri
Samson Arthur and Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao for having 
committed offences under Sections 191, 192, 193 and 209 of the
Indian Penal Code.
      In C.A. No.1163 of 2013, filed before the Learned Company
Judge, the respondent herein contended that C.P. No. 30 of 2012
was filed by M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company seeking winding up of  
the respondent-company, raising false claims of amounts being
allegedly due for services purportedly rendered to them; the order
of winding up, passed on 06-07-2012, was because of collusion
between R.N. Marwah & Company, Sri Samson Arthur and Sri N.    
Chandrasekhar Rao who wrongly admitted liability of the
respondent-company towards M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company,     
though no amount was due; on 13-06-2012 an affidavit was filed
in C.P. No.30 of 2012, on behalf of the respondent-company, by Sri
N. Chandrasekhar Rao wherein he stated that the respondent 
company did not have any assets; however the audit report, which
was accepted by Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao, records that the 
respondent-company had sufficient assets in terms of money i.e.
Rs.62,91,40,790 owed to it by Mack Soft Tech Pvt. Ltd (Mack Soft
in short); no mention was made by Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao, 
before the Company Court, of the dilution of shareholding of the
respondent-company in Mack Soft which is the subject matter of
challenge in O.S. No.21 of 2012; on the contrary, in the affidavit
sworn to on 13-06-2012 and filed before the Company Court, Sri
N. Chandrasekhar Rao had stated that the respondent-company   
was not operating from the last more than one and half years;
information regarding, dilution of shareholding, was suppressed by
Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao which constitutes a suggestion of
falsehood i.e., suppression veri suggestio falsi; in another affidavit
filed in C.P. No.30 of 2012 on 15-06-2012, whereby extension of
time was sought to furnish the books of accounts of the
respondent-company to the Official Liquidator, Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao had stated that, as its records were in bad
shape, the respondent-company was in the process of compiling 
complete records to file the same before the Official Liquidator; Sri
N. Chandrasekhar Rao filed an application, on behalf of Mack Soft
in O.S. No.21 of 2012 under Section 446 of the Companies Act,
1956, seeking stay of further proceedings in O.S. No.21 of 2012 on
the ground that an order of winding up dated 06.07.2012 was
passed against the respondent-company; after falsely admitting
liability towards M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company, and collusively
obtaining an order of winding up against the respondent-company,
Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao, by filing the application under Section
446 of the Companies Act, had sought to misuse the order of
winding up dated 06-07-2012 to prevent the bankruptcy receiver
for QLS from taking control of the affairs of Mack Soft, and had
thereby perpetrated the abuse of process of the court; in response
to C.P. No.30 of 2012 filed by M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company, Sri 
Samson Arthur had filed a counter affidavit, purportedly acting on
behalf of the respondent-company, wherein he stated that as the
respondent-company was in financial difficulty it could not make
payment to the petitioner, the reasons for non-payment was the
continued financial crunch that the respondent company was
presently facing, they had requested the petitioner to bear with the
respondent-company in view of the on going financial crunch, and
were trying to clear the outstanding dues of the petitioner
arranging funds from some other source; these statements were 
falsely made by Sri Samson Arthur despite his knowledge to the
contrary of the actual financial position of the respondent-
company; the averments of Sri Samson Arthur, in the aforesaid
counter affidavit, were in contrast to his averments in the caveat
filed by him on 10-02-2012 wherein he claimed that the dues of
the petitioner had been paid; these contradictory statements were
an abuse of process of court; the audit report of Mack Soft
disclosed that the respondent-company had lent Rs.62,91,40,970 
to its subsidiary i.e., Mack Soft; these facts clearly demonstrate
that the proceedings in the Company Petition were collusive, that
Sri Samson Arthur and Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao had deliberately 
filed false affidavits before the Court, they had deliberately
withheld material information from the Court, and had concealed
several relevant facts known to them; the action and conduct of Sri
Samson Arthur and Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao in making false  
statements, deliberately withholding relevant information, and
suppressing material facts from the Court, reflects their
willingness to act in the interests of, and at the instructions of, the
erstwhile management of the respondent company; and, as such,  
the application in C.A. No.1163 of 2013 was filed seeking a
direction to register a criminal case against both Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao and Sri Samson Arthur.  
      The appellants herein filed their counter affidavits, in C.A.
No.1163 of 2013 before the Company Court, stating that the
authority of Mr. Robert Dix to file the said application was
defective, in the absence of properly authorised and executed
documents; the dispute in C.P. No.30 of 2012 related to non-
payment of the contractual dues, by the respondent company, 
under the agreement dated 04-05-2011; the validity of the
agreement dated 04-05-2011 had not been disputed even by the 
respondent-company; the entire proceedings, by the bankruptcy 
receiver, started only after 06-07-2011 when he was allegedly
appointed as the bankruptcy receiver of Quinn Logistics Sweden;
the agreement between M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company and the     
respondent-company was signed on 04-05-2011 i.e. more than two  
months prior to the alleged appointment of the bankruptcy
receiver;  there is no averment in the affidavit, filed in support of
C.A. No.1163 of 2013, that the said agreement is a sham or has
been backdated or that payment was made by the respondent   
company to M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company; the counter affidavit 
filed by Sri Samson Arthur honestly mentioned the financial
difficulties faced by the respondent-company; the veracity of the
statement of Sri Samson Arthur, regarding the financial difficulties
faced by the respondent- company and the consequent inability to
pay the petitioners dues, is duly established by the bank
statements annexed along with the affidavit dated 13.06.2012 filed
by Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao; as per the annexed documents, the  
respondent-company had two bank accounts with HDFC bank and     
HSBC Bank; while the respondent-company had a bank balance of   
Rs.9,99,150/- in HDFC bank, a sum of Rs.2,772/- was lying to
their credit in their HSBC bank account; the veracity of the bank
statements has not been disputed by the respondent-company; it 
was evident that, as on that date i.e. 07-06-2012, the respondent-
company was financially unable to meet its admitted liabilities; the
fact that it was owed money by Mack Soft is completely immaterial
as it would be a claim to be made by the respondent-company 
against Mack Soft; that is no ground for the respondent-company
to deny payment of its admitted liability; on the date on which the
agreement was executed, there was no order appointing the 
bankruptcy receiver as receiver in bankruptcy of Quinn Logistics
Sweden AB; the respondent-company could not allege that  
attempts were made by the petitioner in C.P. No.30 of 2012, in
collusion with the erstwhile management, to obstruct a change in
the management of the respondent-company, and to prevent the  
court appointed receiver, in the bankruptcy of Quinn Logistics
Sweden AB, from taking control of the assets of the respondent-
company; the application in C.A. No.1163 of 2013 had been
preferred with the sole motive of intimidating the present/ex-
employees of the respondent-company; under the agreement dated   
04-05-2011, Rs.45,00,000/- was required to be paid to M/s. R.N.
Marwah & Company by the respondent-company for having    
provided services; the liability was admitted by the appellants that,
although the amount was due to M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company,    
the respondent-company was unable to pay the dues because of its 
financial condition; the question of action being initiated against
the appellants, for having committed perjury, does not arise; the
EGM proceedings dated 18-02-2012 are not within their
knowledge; it is denied that the documents filed by Mack Soft
contained an audit report of Mack Soft dated 29-06-2011 issued by
Sarath and Associates, Chartered Accountants for the year ending
31-03-2011; the respondent-company used to be the holding 
Company of Mack Soft; however fresh equity was issued by Mack  
Soft in June, 2011 to Mecon FZC, and the share holding of the
respondent-company was transferred in August, 2011 to UCA  
Logvis AG; as on date the respondent-company is not a 
shareholder of Mack Soft; the dispute, relating to these
transactions, is pending adjudication before the District Court,
Ranga Reddy in O.S. Nos.21 of 2012 and O.S. No.1303 of 2013; as  
per the audit report, a balance loan of Rs.62,91,40,790 is pending
in the books of Mack Soft as payable to the respondent-company; 
and this liability towards the respondent-company is also reflected
in the balance sheet of Mack Soft dated 31-03-2012.  The
appellants denied that, in accordance with the audit report, the
respondent-company had sufficient assets in terms of money owed 
to it by Mack Soft, or that they had falsely admitted liability
towards the petitioner and had collusively obtained a winding up
order against the respondent-company.  The appellants also denied
that the respondent-company was now under the management of   
Sri Robert Dix, Sri Paul Mc. Gowan, and Sri Bryan O' Neil who
were unanimously appointed as Directors at the EGM held on 18- 
02-2012, and subsequently confirmed at the EGM of the 
respondent-company convened on 29-07-2013 wherein the   
shareholders had also conferred authority on them to institute
legal proceedings on behalf of the respondent-company.  According
to the appellants, the facts narrated above clearly showed that the
affidavits dated 16-02-2012 and 13-06-2012 had truthfully and
honestly mentioned the correct financial condition of the
respondent company; and there was no falsity in the averments
made by them.  
      In the order under appeal, the Learned Company Judge
observed that the power, under Section 340 Cr.P.C, can be invoked
upon an application to the Court or otherwise; the only enquiry
contemplated under Section 340(1) Cr.P.C, irrespective of the
result of the main case, is whether a prima facie case is made out
which, if rebutted, may have a reasonable likelihood to establish
the specified offence and whether it is also expedient, in the
interest of justice, to take such action; the purpose of enacting
Section 340(1) Cr.P.C is to further arm the Court with a weapon to
deal with more flagrant cases, and not to take away the weapon
already in its possession; the object of the legislature, underlying
enactment of Section 340 (1) Cr.P.C, is that the evil of perjury, and
fabrication of evidence, should be eradicated; and the present
application was maintainable under Section 340 (1) Cr.P.C.
      After taking note of the statement of Sri N. Chandra Sekhar
Rao, in his affidavit dated 13.06.2012 in C.P.No.30 of 2012, the
Learned Company Judge observed that the affidavit filed by Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, prima facie, showed that he had given a false
statement that the respondent-company did not have assets at all,
and non-payment of the outstanding amount due by the 
respondent-company was due to the prevailing financial condition
of the respondent-company; it is not the case of Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, even in his counter affidavit, that they were
unable to secure the amount from Mack Soft, and Mack Soft was  
not paying the amounts due to them, which had resulted in the
respondent-company being disabled from paying the debts due to 
the petitioner; similarly, the averment of Sri Samson Arthur, in the
counter affidavit filed in C.A. No.102 of 2012 dated 16.02.2012,
(filed for appointment of a provisional liquidator), in justification of
non-payment of the outstanding dues, was the prevailing financial
condition of the respondent-company, which is contrary to the
audit report filed by Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao himself, as
representative of Mack Soft before the Ranga Reddy District Court;
the audit report shows that Rs.62,91,40,970/- is due to the
respondent-company from Mack Soft; the amount due from Mack    
Soft to the respondent-company is also admitted in the counter-
affidavit filed in C.A. No.1163 of 2013; the Company Court, while
appointing the provisional liquidator in C.P. No.30 of 2012 filed by
the petitioner, held that the Court had passed the order,
appointing a provisional liquidator, since the counter affidavit filed
by Sri Samson Arthur was vague, and he had not chosen to give 
details of the assets of the respondent-company nor had they
assured the Court that the assets would not be taken away beyond 
the jurisdiction of the Court; a caveat petition was admittedly filed
by the respondent-company on 10.02.2012, before the winding-up 
petition in C.P. No.30 of 2012 was filed on 14.02.2012 and the
winding up order was passed on 06.07.2012; the sequence of 
events, leading to the winding up order in C.P. No.30 of 2012 in
quick succession, gave rise to the presumption that the appellants
had not placed correct facts, before the Company Court, before the
order of winding up was passed; the appellants were legally bound
by oath to state the truth in the affidavits filed by them in C.P.
No.30 of 2012; and, prima facie, they had made a false statement
which constituted an offence of giving false evidence as defined
under Section 191 punishable under Section 193 and 209 IPC. 
      Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court, in In Re:
Suo Motu proceedings against R. Karuppan, Advocate , the 
Learned Company Judge directed the Registrar (Judicial) to depute
an officer, not below the rank of Assistant Registrar, to file a
complaint under Section 340 (1) Cr.P.C read with Sections 191,
193 and 209 IPC against the appellants herein before a Magistrate
of competent jurisdiction at Hyderabad.  The said officer was
directed to file the complaint, and take all steps necessary for
prosecuting the complaint.  The concerned Magistrate was directed
to deal with the same as per law without being influenced by any of
the observations made in the order, since they were made only for
the purpose of a preliminary enquiry under Section 340 (1) Cr.P.C.
Aggrieved thereby, the present appeals were filed.
      Elaborate oral submissions were put forth, both on the
maintainability of the appeals and on merits, by Sri S. Ravi,
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and
Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-
company.  Written submissions were filed by Sri A. Srikant Reddy,
Learned Counsel for the appellants, and Sri S. Niranjan Reddy,
Learned Counsel for the respondent-company. 
I. SECTION 340(1) CRPC: ITS SCOPE:    
      It is necessary to note, albeit in brief, the scope of enquiry in
a proceeding instituted under Section 340 C.P.C.  As noted
hereinabove C.A. No.1163 of 2013 in Company Petition No.30 of 
2012 was filed, under Section 340 Cr.P.C. requesting the Company 
Court to register a complaint against both Mr. Samson Arthur and
Mr N. Chandrasekhar Rao, under Sections 191, 192, 193 and 209  
and other applicable provisions of the Indian Penal Code.    Section
191 IPC relates to giving false evidence, Section 192 IPC relates to
fabricating false evidence, Section 193 IPC prescribes the
punishment for false evidence, and Section 209 IPC relates to
dishonestly making a false claim in Court.
        Section 195(1)(b)(i) Cr.P.C stipulates that no Court shall take
cognizance of any offence punishable under Sections 193 to 196
(both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228 of
the Indian Penal Code, when such offence is alleged to have been
committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except
on the complaint in writing of that Court or by such officer of the
Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of
some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.  Section 193
IPC prescribes the punishment for both Sections 191 and 192 IPC.
Consequently, Section 195(1)(b)(i) Cr.P.C. disables any Court from
take cognizance of the offences under Sections 191, 192, 193 and
209 IPC except on a complaint in writing by the Court before which
such offences were committed or by such officer of the Court as
that Court may authorise in writing.
      The procedure, applicable to cases falling within the ambit of
Section 195(1)(b)(i) Cr.P.C, is prescribed in Section 340 Cr.P.C.
Under sub-section (1) thereof, when, upon an application made to
it in this behalf or otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it is
expedient, in the interest of justice, that an inquiry should be
made into any offence referred to in Section 195(1)(b), which
appears to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding in
that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a document
produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in that Court, such
Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks
necessary, (a) record a finding to that effect; (b) make a complaint
thereof in writing; (c) send it to a Magistrate of the First Class
having jurisdiction; (d) take sufficient security for the appearance
of the accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged offence is
non-bailable and the Court thinks it necessary so to do, send the
accused in custody to such Magistrate; and (e) bind over any
person to appear and give evidence before such Magistrate.  The
only course available to the respondent-company for action to be
taken, for what they believed were offences committed by the
appellants under Sections 191, 192, 193 and 209 IPC, was to
make an application to the Company Court under Section 340(1) 
Cr.P.C.
      The hub of Section 340(1) Cr.P.C is the formation of opinion
by the court (before which proceedings are to be held) that it is
expedient, in the interest of justice, that an inquiry should be
made into an offence which appears to have been committed. In
order to form such an opinion, the court is empowered to hold a
preliminary inquiry. It is not peremptory that such preliminary
inquiry should be held. Even without such preliminary inquiry the
Court can form such an opinion when it appears to it that an
offence has been committed in relation to a proceeding in that
court.  Even when the court forms such an opinion it is not
mandatory that the Court should make a complaint. Sub-Section 
(1) of Section 340 Cr.P.C has conferred a power on the court to do
so. It does not mean that the court should, as a matter of course,
make a complaint. But once the court decides to do so, then the
court should record a finding to the effect that, on the fact
situation, it is expedient, in the interest of justice, that the offence
should further be probed into. If the court finds it necessary to
conduct a preliminary inquiry to reach such a finding it is always
open to the court to do so, though absence of any such preliminary
inquiry would not vitiate a finding reached by the court regarding
its opinion.  The preliminary inquiry, contemplated in Section
340(1), is not for finding whether any particular person is guilty or
not.  The purpose of a preliminary inquiry, even if the court opts to
conduct it, is only to decide whether it is expedient, in the interest
of justice, to inquire into the offence which appears to have been
committed.  (Pritish v. State of Maharashtra ).
      At an enquiry held by the Court under Section 340(1) CrPC,
irrespective of the result of the main case, the only question is
whether a prima facie case is made out which, if unrebutted, may
have a reasonable likelihood of establishing the specified offence,
and whether it is also expedient in the interest of justice to take
such action.  The twin preconditions for laying a complaint, after
an enquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C, are that the material
produced before the Court should make out a prima facie case for
a complaint, and secondly that it is expedient in the interest of
justice to permit the prosecution under Section 193 IPC.  (K.
Karunakaran v. T.V. Eachara Warrier ).
      The Court, at the stage envisaged in Section 340 Cr.P.C, is
not deciding the guilt or innocence of the party against whom
proceedings are to be taken before the magistrate. At that stage the
court only considers whether it is expedient, in the interest of
justice, that an inquiry should be made into any offence affecting
administration of justice. (Pritish2).  An enquiry, when made under
Section 340(1) CrPC, is really in the nature of affording a locus
paenitentiae to a person and, at that stage, the Court chooses to
take action.  The party may choose to place all its materials before
the Court at that stage but, if it does not, it will not be estopped
from doing so later in the trial, in case prosecution is sanctioned
by the Court. It does not mean that the appellants will not have
full and adequate opportunity in due course of the process of
justice to establish their innocence. (K. Karunakaran3).
       Bearing in mind the scope of an enquiry under Section 340
Cr.P.C, let us now examine the rival submissions, urged on behalf
of the appellants and the respondent-company, under different
heads. 
II. FALSE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE AFFIDAVITS FILED          
     BEFORE THE HIGH COURT:     

        It is not even the case of the appellants that there is any
procedural violation, in the complaint directed to be made to the
concerned Magistrate, necessitating interference in appeal.  Their
case, in short, is that no prima facie case is made out of their
having committed the offences under Sections 191, 192, 193 and
209 IPC, much less intentionally, justifying registration of
complaints against them.
      Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellants, would submit that Mr. Samson Arthur, who filed
the affidavit dated 16.02.2012, thereafter left Mack Soft on
31.03.2012; there was no allegation that Mr. Samson Arthur had
knowledge about the balance sheet of Mack Soft, or that he was
aware that Mack Soft had a balance outstanding of
Rs.62,91,40,970/- as due to QLI in its books; the bank accounts of
QLI, at the relevant time, showed a balance of Rs. 9,99,150/- in
HDFC Bank and Rs. 2,772/- in HSBC Bank; Mr. Samson Arthur    
did not state anything about the assets of the Company; he merely
referred to the financial position of QLI as on the date of the
affidavit; it is not in dispute that QLI had no money available in the
bank, other than what is reflected in the bank statements; the
appellant in OSA No. 11 of 2015 ie Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao was 
an employee of Mack Soft; he was an electrical engineer by
qualification; his job description was of management of the I. T.
Park of 1.2 million sq. ft. built up area; his role was that of
engineering, soft services, liasoning with the local government
authorities, vendor management, clients management etc; he had 
no familiarity with the accounts of the company; the extent of his
ignorance, of the accounts of the Company, is clear from the
affidavit dated 13.06.2012 wherein he stated that QLI did not have
any assets at all; in the same breath he had stated that QLI did not
have sufficient balance in its bank accounts(s) to meet its legal
liabilities and that, as on 07-06-2012, QLI had a balance of Rs.
9,99,150/- in HDFC Bank, and Rs. 2,772/- in HSBC Bank, and  
the Company has not been operating since one and a half years; he
had faithfully given the bank balances of the respondent-company;
he did not even equate the bank balances to assets of the
Company which shows a complete lack of understanding of the 
word assets as understood by men of commerce; it was only much  
later that he filed the balance sheet of Mack Soft, along with the
documents, in the year 2013 before the Ranga Reddy District
Court; the pleadings of Mack Soft, in the said proceedings in
Ranga Reddy District Court in which the balance sheet was filed,
were being annexed as it did not form part of the record; even
therein Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao has not made any statement  
about the financial position of QLI; a person, who does not
understand that bank balance is an asset, cannot be attributed
to have studied the balance sheet, when he filed an affidavit before
the Company Court on 13.06.2012, a copy of which he had  
produced a year later before the Ranga Reddy District Court;  Mr.
N. Chandrasekhar Rao too had no financial interest in Mack Soft
or QLI; he was neither a shareholder nor was he a Director of QLI
or Mack Soft; he was a paid employee; the findings recorded by the
Learned Company Judge is not that he had made false statements  
in the affidavit but is more about what the affidavit failed to
disclose; and this is not what is contemplated under Section 193
or Section 209 I.P.C.
        On the other hand Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel
for the respondent-company, would submit that the application, in
C.A. No.1163 of 2013 in C.P. No.30 of 2012, was premised on the
fact that deliberate wrong statements were made by the appellants
in the affidavits filed before the Company Court on 16.02.2012,
13.06.2012 and 15.06.2012 as part of a collusive effort to get the
winding up order passed against QLI; in C.A. No. 1163 of 2013 it is
specifically stated that the sequence of events, leading to the
passing of winding up order dated 06.07.2012, would expose the
design behind the abuse of process of Court by filing false
affidavits; the order of the Company Court, in C.A. No.102 of 2012
in C.P.No. 30 of 2012 dated 17.02.2012, refers to lack of
particulars and vagueness in the counter affidavit filed by Mr.
Samson Arthur leading to the High Court forming an impression
about the necessity to appoint a provisional liquidator; the said
order also records grant of full opportunity to QLI, prior to passing
an order appointing a provisional liquidator; the said order clearly
manifests that false evidence led before the Court had resulted in
the course of justice being subverted/diverted; this was expressly
noticed by the Company Judge while allowing C.A. No.1163 of 
2013; the said order was, thereafter, sought to be capitalized by
Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao by filing an I.A. in O.S. No.21 of 2011
under Section 446(1) seeking to delay the suit initiated by the
bankruptcy receiver of QLI; withholding critical information had
also resulted in the passing of a winding up order on 06.07.2012
which specifically notes that the liability was not disputed, but the
company failed to liquidate the same;  and the sequence of events,
and the effect of the orders, would clearly show as to how
affidavits, filed by the appellants, were pernicious and constituted
offences under Sections 191, 193 and 209 IPC in respect of which
Section 340 Cr. P.C. proceedings were initiated.
      Learned Counsel would highlight the further falsities in the
affidavits sworn to by the appellants even thereafter.  He would
submit that, while countering the averments made by QLI that Mr.
Samson Arthur seemed to be in the employment of QLI from  
14.04.2011, Mr. Samson Arthur, in his counter-affidavit filed in
C.A. No.1163 of 2013, had stated that he continued to serve in QLI
till June, 2012 by consistently indicating, throughout the counter-
affidavit, as if he was in the employment of QLI; in the additional
affidavit, now filed before the appellate court on 25th  June 2015,
Mr. Samson Arthur has filed a service certificate given by Mack
Soft which clearly indicates that he was never in the service of QLI,
but was with Quinn Property Management Pvt. Ltd. until
30.06.2011, and had joined Mack Soft from 01.07.2011; while it
was asserted by both the appellants, in the counter-affidavits filed
in reply to C.A. No. 1163 of 2013 before the Company Court, that
the amounts repayable to QLI by Mack Soft were not material and
were irrelevant, and lack of knowledge of accounts was stated in
justification, in the additional affidavits filed on 25th June 2015, by
both the appellants, it is contended that they have no knowledge
about accounts; this claim is belied by the positions held by both
of them as stated in their resumes filed along with the additional
affidavit dated 25th June 2015 filed by Mr. Samson Arthur and Mr.
N. Chandra Sekhar Rao wherein  Mr. Samson Arthur claims to be  
a commerce graduate and an MBA in marketing, and Mr. Chandra    
Shekhar Rao claims to be an engineer and a MBA in operations 
management.  
(a): FALSE STATEMENTS IN THE AFFIDAVITS MUST BE          
       CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE SEQUENCE OF         
       EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE ORDER OF WINDING UP:          

      A picture is presented by Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned
Counsel, of deceit and a deliberate and calculated attempt by the
appellants to mislead the Company Court only to prevent a change
in the composition of the Board of Directors of QLI, and to disable
the bankruptcy receiver, appointed by the District Court
Stockholm for Quinn Logistics Sweden (AB), from taking control of
its assets and that of its subsidiary Mack Soft by misleading the
Court to appoint a provisional liquidator, and thereafter an official
liquidator to take charge of the assets of QLI.     According to Sri S.
Niranjan Reddy, the false averments made by the appellants must
be seen in the context of the several events which took place within
a short span of time both before and after an extra-ordinary
general meeting of QLI was held on 18.02.2012. The Learned
Company Judge has also held that the sequence of events, leading
to the passing of a winding up order in C.P. No.30 of 2012, in
quick succession gives rise to the presumption that the appellants
had not placed correct facts before the Court before the winding up
order was passed.  It is necessary, therefore, to refer to the
sequence of events narrated by Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned
Counsel, without expressing any opinion on whether it is true or
not.
      According to the Learned Counsel, Quinn Logistics Sweden
AB (QLS) was the holding company of Quinn Logistics India Private
Limited (QLI) which in turn was the holding company of Mack Soft
Tech Private Limited.  QLI held 9,990 shares and Quinn Logistics
India Private Limited held the remaining 10 shares in Mack Soft
(Mack Soft for short) its subsidiary, constituting 10,000 shares of
its validly issued share capital. QLI had invested Rs.126,73 Crores
in the share-capital of, and lent Rs.62.91 Crores to, Mack Soft
which had utilised these amounts to construct a huge complex
generating large amount as revenue in the form of lease rentals.
The amounts lent by QLI to Mack Soft of Rs.62.91 crores was 
reflected in the audited balance-sheet of Mack Soft for the financial
year ending 31st March, 2011.  The District Court at Stockholm in
Sweden passed an Order on 05.07.2011 appointing a Bankruptcy   
Receiver for Quinn Investments Sweden AB which was declared  
bankrupt on account of its failure to repay the debt of Rs.12,734
Crores owed by it to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited
(IBRC) under the agreement dated 22.11.2007.  The District
Court at Stockholm also appointed a Bankruptcy Receiver for
Quinn Logistics Sweden AB (QLS for short) on 06.07.2011.  The
members of the Quinn family, and their agents, issued 3,76,301
equity shares in Mack Soft to Mecon FZE on 22.06.2011, to dilute
the shareholding of QLI in Mack Soft, and thereby ensure that QLI
no longer had any controlling interest in Mack Soft.  The dilution of
shareholding is said to be the subject matter of challenge in O.S.
No.21 of 2012 before the Additional District Judge, Ranga Reddy
filed by Quinn Logistics Sweden AB. The 10,000 shares held by
QLI and Quinn Lodgings India Private Limited in Mack Soft, (for
which QLI had paid Rs.126.73 Crores), were purportedly
transferred to UCA Logvis AG in August, 2011 for merely
Rs.9,90,000/-, which is said to be under challenge in O.S. No.1303
of 2013 filed before the Additional District Judge, Ranga Reddy
District wherein an ex parte injunction is said to have been granted
on 25.10.2013 restraining UCA Logvis ATG from transferring the
shares held by it in Mack Soft. According to the Learned Counsel,
both Mecon FZE and UCA Logvis AG are believed to be directly or 
indirectly controlled by the Quinn family.
      QLS, through its Bankruptcy Receiver, is said to have sent a
letter of requisition on 28.12.2011 to QLI (its subsidiary) to call for
an extra-ordinary general meeting of QLI to remove the existing
directors viz., Mr. John (Sean) Ignatius Quinn, Mr. Peter Quinn
and Mr. John Dara O Reilly, and for appointment of new directors
viz., Mr. Robert Dix, Mr. Paul McGowan and Mr. Bryan O Neil.
QLS, through its Bankruptcy Receiver, filed O.S. No.19 of 2012
before the Ranga Reddy District Court which, by its order dated
05.01.2012, restrained the previous management from adding new 
directors to QLI.  Soon thereafter M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co, a
Chartered Accountants firm having its office at New Delhi, sent a
notice dated 17.01.2012, under Section 434 of the Companies Act,
calling upon QLI to make payment of Rs.45,00,000/- plus service
tax for the consultancy fees payable to them in terms of the invoice
dated 02.11.2011.  The said notice was delivered to QLI on
19.01.2012 and Mr. Samson Arthur promptly, and on the very 
same day, gave a reply to the notice, on behalf of QLI, admitting
the liability of M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co.
      Pursuant to the letter of requisition dated 28.12.2011,
issued by QLS represented by the Bankruptcy Receiver, QLI issued 
a notice on 23.01.2012 calling for an extra-ordinary general
meeting on 18.02.2012 for removal of the existing directors and for
appointment of new directors in their place.  After a notice was
issued on 23.01.2012 by QLI for convening the extra-ordinary
general meeting, and before the extra-ordinary general meeting
was convened on 18.02.2012, Mr. Samson Arthur filed a caveat 
petition, on behalf of QLI and Quinn Lodgings India Ltd, in the
High Court of A.P on 10.02.2012 against M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co. 
In the affidavit, filed in support of the caveat petition, Mr. Samson
Arthur stated that all the dues of M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co., against
the invoices raised by them, had already been cleared.  Four days
thereafter, on 14.02.2012, C.P. No.30 of 2012 was filed by M/s.
R.N. Marwah & Co. seeking winding up of QLI. 
      In C.P. No.30 of 2012, M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co stated that a
legal notice was issued by them on 17.01.2012 demanding  
payment; the said notice was delivered at the registered office of
QLI on 19.01.2012; and a reply was given on the very same day by
Mr. Samson Arthur, on behalf of QLI, seeking time till 01.02.2012
to pay the outstanding debt.  Along with C.P. No.30 of 2012, M/s.
R.N. Marwah & Co. filed Company Application Nos.102, 103 and  
104 of 2012.  Company Application No.102 of 2012 was filed by
them seeking appointment of the Official Liquidator as the
Provisional Liquidator of QLI with all powers, under Sections 450
and 451 of the Companies Act, including the power to take charge
of the assets, properties, stock in trade and books of accounts of
QLI pending admission, hearing and final disposal of C.P. No.30 of
2012.  Company Application No.103 of 2012 was filed seeking a
direction from the Company Court that, pending disposal of C.P.
No.30 of 2012, QLI, its directors, officers etc. be restrained from, in
any manner, disposing of, transferring, encumbering, alienating,
creating third party rights or parting with possession of the assets
and properties of QLI.  Company Application No.104 of 2012 was
filed by M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co. requesting the Company Court, 
pending disposal of C.P. No.30 of 2012, to restrain QLI, its
directors, officers etc. from, in any manner whatsoever, altering the
composition of the Board and changing the Memorandum and   
Articles of Association of the respondent-Company without
permission till appointment of a provisional liquidator.
      It is only after a winding up order is made that, ordinarily,
the official liquidator is appointed as the liquidator of the company,
ordered to be wound up, to take into his custody or control all the
property, effects, and actionable claims which the Company,
ordered to be wound up, is entitled to. Section 450(1) of the
Companies Act carves out an exception thereto, and enables the
Company Court, at any time after the presentation of the winding
up petition and before the making of a winding up order, to
appoint the official liquidator to be the provisional liquidator of the
company sought to be wound up.  The conditions precedent, for
appointment of a provisional liquidator, are those prescribed in
Section 450(2) of the Companies Act whereunder the Court is
required to give a notice to the company sought to be wound up,
and give them a reasonable opportunity to make a representation.
A provisional liquidator appointed by the Court has, as stipulated
under Section 450(3), the same powers as the official liquidator
and continues to be the liquidator, of the company sought to be
wound up, till an order of winding up is passed.  After an order of
winding up is passed the company, ordered to be wound up, would 
come under the control of the official liquidator.
      The effect of appointing a provisional liquidator is that the
Board of Directors of the Company, sought to be wound up, cannot
thereafter exercise control over the management of the company,
and all the assets of the company are brought under the control of
the provisional liquidator.  The submission of Sri S. Niranjan
Reddy, Learned Counsel, is that the entire process was stage
managed, and the Company Court was mislead into appointing a  
provisional liquidator, to ensure that the shareholders of QLI were
prevented from changing the composition of its Board of Directors
in its extra-ordinary general meeting to be held on 18.02.2012, and
the new directors prevented from taking control of the affairs of the
respondent-company.  
      To continue the narration of events, as stated by Sri S.
Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, the need for the Company Court 
to issue a notice, in C.A. No.102 of 2012 in C.P. No.30 of 2012, to
the respondent-company was obviated as a caveat petition was 
filed before the Company Court by Sri Samson Arthur on behalf of
QLI, and they were represented by Counsel.  The respondent-
company was given an opportunity of filing its counter to C.A.
No.102 of 2012 whereby appointment of a provisional liquidator
was sought.  Mr. Samson Arthur who had filed a caveat petition on
10.02.2012 on behalf of QLI, stating that all the dues of M/s. R.N.
Marwah & Co against the invoices raised by them, had been 
cleared, filed a counter-affidavit in Company Application No.102 of
2012 on 16.02.2012, readily admitting liability and stating that
non-payment of the outstanding dues of M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co. 
was because of the present financial condition of QLI.
      In its order, in Company Application No.102 of 2012 in
Company Petition No.30 of 2012 dated 17.02.2012, the Company   
Court noted that the basis, for seeking appointment of a
provisional liquidator, was the apprehension of the petitioner that
the respondent-company and its directors may be devising ways 
and means of disposing of, alienating and parting with the assets
of the respondent-company to third parties with a view to defeat
the legitimate claims of the creditors like the petitioner; the
petitioner (M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company) believed that the assets
of the respondent would be insufficient to satisfy the dues of the
creditors including the petitioner, and eventually the petitioner
may well be left with no reasonable possibility of ever recovering its
lawful dues from the respondent-company; except for a bare and
vague denial in the counter-affidavit, the respondent-company
(QLI) had neither chosen to give details of its assets nor had it
assured the Court that the assets would not be taken beyond the
jurisdiction of the Court; Section 450 of the Companies Act
conferred power on the Company Court to appoint the official
liquidator as the provisional liquidator; the requirement of Section
450(2), of giving notice to the company and giving them a
reasonable opportunity to make their representation, had been
complied with; the respondent-company (QLI) had filed its counter-
affidavit; and under Section 456(1) of the Companies Act, where a
provisional liquidator has been appointed, he shall take into his
custody, or under his control, the property, effects and actionable
claims to which the company is, or appears to be, entitled.
      The Company Court further observed that a strong prima
facie case for winding up had been made out; the petitioners
assertion, regarding the amounts due and payable to them, had
been admitted as payable by the respondent; the respondent (QLI)
had neither chosen to furnish details of their properties and
assets, nor did they specifically state that they would not remove
these properties beyond the jurisdiction of the Court; and it was
just and equitable for a provisional liquidator to be appointed to
exercise jurisdiction under Sections 450 and 456 of the Companies
Act.  The Official Liquidator attached to the High Court was
appointed as the provisional liquidator.
      The order passed by the Company Court, in Company 
Application No.102 of 2012 in C.P. No.30 of 2012 dated
17.02.2012, required the Official Liquidator, attached to the High
Court, to take charge of all the assets of QLI which, according to
Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, meant that the
Bankruptcy Receiver of QLS was effectively prevented from taking
control of the assets of QLI, and consequently its subsidiary-Mack
Soft.  According to the Learned Counsel, as the object of ensuring
that the Bankruptcy Receiver of QLS did not take control of the
assets of QLI, and its subsidiary-Mack Soft, was achieved by the
order passed in Company Application No.102 of 2012 dated 
17.02.2012, the Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of
M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co, informed the Court that they did not
desire to press for an order being passed in Company Application
Nos.103 and 104 of 2012 and, consequently, both the said
applications were dismissed by this Court by its order dated
17.02.2012.
      Learned Counsel would further submit that M/s. R.N.
Marwah & Company had filed suit No.144 of 2012 before the 
Additional District Judge, Patiala House, New Delhi against QLI
and its directors seeking recovery of money allegedly due for
services purportedly rendered by them to QLI; though Mr. Samson 
Arthur, appeared on caveat at the hearing of the injunction
petition filed in Suit No.144 of 2012, there was no opposition by
him to the grant of an injunction order, which resulted in an order
of injunction being passed restraining QLI and its directors from,
in any manner, carrying out changes to the Articles of Association
of QLI relating to the removal of directors and composition of the
existing board of directors, either by removal of the existing
directors or by inducting new directors, without the written
consent of the petitioner. This order of injunction, according to Sri
S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, prevented a change being 
made to the erstwhile management of QLI, and was obtained to 
frustrate the Bankruptcy Receiver of QLS from taking control of
QLI and its subsidiary Mack Soft.  As the order of injunction did
not restrain the shareholders of QLI from holding its EGM on
18.02.2012, the EGM was held and resolutions were passed  
therein to take effect after the injunction order was vacated.
Subsequently, after the order of injunction dated 15.02.2012 was
vacated by the Delhi High Court on 06.07.2012, the resolutions are
said to have been given effect to.  Curiously M/s. R.N. Marwah &
Co, which had filed the suit for recovery of money, did not
prosecute suit No.144 of 2012 thereafter, and the said suit was
subsequently dismissed for non-prosecution, by the Patiala House
Court, on 03.04.2013.
      The Provisional Liquidator, appointed by the Company
Court, appears to have asked QLI, by his letter dated 02.04.2012,
to deliver the properties and books of accounts of the company.
C.A. No.739 of 2012 was filed, on behalf of QLI by Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, requesting the Company Court to grant them  
three weeks time to submit the entire records, pertaining to QLI to
the Official Liquidator.  In the affidavit filed in support of C.A.
No.739 of 2011,  Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao stated that the Court
had appointed a provisional liquidator on 17.02.2012; a letter was
addressed by the Official Liquidator on 02.04.2012 asking QLI to
deliver the money, property or books or papers pertaining to the
Company; the same was received by QLI on 05.04.2012; as the  
Company was not carrying on any activity for the past one year,
most of the employees had left the Company, and the records of
the Company were in bad shape; QLI was in the process of 
compiling the complete records in order to file the same before the
Official Liquidator; the delay in submitting the records to the
Official Liquidator was unintentional; additional time should be
granted for submitting the records; and the Company does not
have any ill-intention not to disclose the requested records as
directed by the Official Liquidator.
      Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would submit that
C.P. No.30 of 2012 was pending before this Court, by the time C.A.
No.739 of 2012 was filed on 15.06.2012; production of the books of
accounts and other records would have revealed that QLI was owed 
Rs.62.91 Crores by Mack Soft; the abuse of process of Court, by
the erstwhile management of QLI, would have come to light; and it
is only to suppress the fact that QLI was commercially solvent, and
had sufficient means to discharge the alleged liability of M/s. R.N.
Marwah & Co. of Rs.45.00 Lakhs, was the application in C.A.
No.739 of 2012 filed seeking extension of time.
      A counter-affidavit was filed in C.P. No.30 of 2012 by Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, on behalf of QLI, on 13.06.2012 admitting its
liability towards the petitioner, stating that QLI had no assets at
all, and seeking time for making payment.  Mr. Ajit Kumar was
examined as PW.1, on behalf of the petitioner ie M/s. R.N. Marwah
& Co, and Exs.P1 to P10 were marked as exhibits.  Except for the
affidavit of Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao, admitting liability towards
the petitioner, neither was PW.1 cross-examined on behalf of QLI,
nor was any evidence adduced on behalf of QLI.
      In its order in C.P. No.30 of 2012 dated 06.07.2012, the
Company Court observed that the affidavit of Sri N.
Chandrasekhar Rao was placed on record, on behalf of the
respondent, wherein the amounts due to the petitioner had been
admitted; the respondent-company did not dispute its liability
towards the petitioner; in the reply to the statutory notice, the
respondent-company had merely sought two weeks time to   
liquidate their liability; the respondent did not choose to cross-
examine P.W-1; the evidence brought on record clearly established
that the liability of the respondent-company, to the petitioner, was
undisputed; and the respondent had failed to liquidate the
undisputed liability which was sufficient to infer that the
respondent-company had become commercially insolvent   
warranting an order of winding up of the respondent company
being passed.  QLI was directed to be wound up and the Official
Liquidator, who as a provisional liquidator was earlier directed to
take into his custody all the properties and effects of the
respondent-company, was appointed as the liquidator of the
respondent-company.  
      Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao filed an application on behalf of
Mack Soft, in O.S. No.21 of 2012, under Section 446 of the
Companies Act, 1956, seeking stay of further proceedings in O.S.
No.21 of 2012, on account of passing of the winding up order
against the respondent-company on 06.07.2012.  Sri S. Niranjan
Reddy, Learned Counsel, would submit that, after falsely admitting
liability towards the petitioner and collusively obtaining the
winding up order against the respondent-company, Mr. N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, by filing a fresh application under Section
446 of the Companies Act, 1956, sought to use the order of
winding up dated 06.07.2012 to prevent the bankruptcy receiver
for QLS from further proceeding in its attempts at controlling the
affairs of Mack Soft.
      Quinn Logistics Sweden AB, represented by its bankruptcy
receiver, filed C.A. No.127 of 2013 in C.P. No.30 of 2012 on
20.12.2012 to recall the order of winding up of QLI.  Pursuant
thereto, the winding up order dated 06.07.2012 was stayed by the
Company Court on 13.08.2013.  Thereafter the order of winding up
dated 06.07.2012 was recalled by order dated 19.11.2013.  QLI,
thereafter, filed an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against
the appellants on 19.11.2013.  As a counter-blast M/s. R.N.
Marwah & Company filed C.A. No.156 of 2014 on 12.02.2014,  
under Section 340 Cr.P.C, against Mr. Robert Dix who had earlier
filed the application in C.A. No.1163 of 2013, under Section 340
Cr.P.C, against the appellants, on behalf of QLI.  Curiously M/s.
R.N. Marwah & Company withdrew C.P. No.30 of 2012 on    
19.03.2014.  They also withdrew C.A. No.156 of 2014 on
25.08.2014.
      While there is no specific denial of the liability of the
respondent-company towards M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co, Sri S.   
Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would submit that the
genuineness of these transactions is suspect is evident from the
fact that M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co, which filed Suit No.144 of 2012
in Delhi and a winding up petition in C.P. No.30 of 2012 before the
Company Court at Hyderabad claiming that a sum of  
Rs.45,00,000/- was due to them, chose not to contest the Suit
which resulted in Suit No.144 of 2012 being dismissed for non-
prosecution on 03.04.2013; and they also withdrew C.P.No.30 of
2012, filed before the Company Court, on 19.03.2014.
      The chronology of events narrated by Sri S. Niranjan Reddy,
if true, would prima facie show that the appellants herein had, in
collusion with M/s. R.N. Marwah & Company, misused the  
hallowed portals of this Court, and had misled it into appointing a
provisional liquidator initially, and thereafter in appointing a
liquidator consequent upon an order of winding up being passed,
only to prevent the bankruptcy receiver of Quinn Logistics Sweden
AB from taking control of the assets of QLI and, consequently, from
taking control of Mack Soft also.
(b). DETAILS OF THE ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS MADE             
      ON OATH BY THE APPELLANTS:      

      It is not in dispute that the balance sheet of Mack Soft, for
the year ending 31.03.2011, recorded that a sum of
Rs.62,91,40,970 was due to QLI from Mack Soft. It is also the
admitted case of the parties that this fact of Rs.62.91 Crores being
due to QLI was neither brought to the notice of the Company Court
by Mr. Samson Arthur in the counter filed by him in C.A.No.102 of
2012, or by Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao in the counter filed by him
in C.P. No.30 of 2012. Bearing in mind the aforesaid sequence of
events, and that these statements were made by Mr. Samson   
Arthur and Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao in the counter-affidavit filed
on behalf of QLI in C.A. No.102 of 2012 seeking appointment of a
provisional liquidator, and in C.P. No.30 of 2012 seeking winding
up of QLI; and a petition seeking winding up, and an application
seeking appointment of a provisional liquidator, form part of the
process of bringing the very existence of the Company to an end,
let us now examine whether, prima facie, the averments made in
the affidavits filed by Sri Samson Arthor and Sri N. Chandrasekhar
Rao are false or not.
      In the counter-affidavit filed before the Company Court on
16.02.2012, in C.A. No.102 of 2012 in C.P. No.30 of 2012 wherein
appointment of a provisional liquidator was sought, Mr. Samson
Arthur stated that:-
            .the only reason for non-payment of the outstanding dues by
respondent company was the prevailing financial condition of the respondent
company    
        
      In the very same counter-affidavit Mr. Samson Arthur also
stated that:-
       . there is no willful default by the Respondent in making the
payment of the outstanding dues, the only reason for non making of the
outstanding dues are that due to present financial condition of Respondent
company as explained above..  

                  Mr. Samson Arthur had filed an affidavit dated 10.02.2012,
in support of the caveat petitions filed, on behalf of QLI and Quinn
Lodgings India before the High Court, against R.N. Marwah & Co
wherein he had stated to the contrary that:-
          . the Respondent started rendering its services in relation to the
FEMA compliances of the Caveator Company and raised invoices, for which  
the Caveator Company has cleared all the dues. Even then, by raising false and
frivolous pleas, they had now issued legal notice under Section 433 of
Companies Act dated 17.01.2012    

      Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would submit that
the averments, in the counter-affidavit filed in C.A. No.102 of 2012
on 16.02.2012, were false as the audit report filed by Mr. N.
Chandra Sekhar Rao, as a representative of Mack Soft before the
Ranga Reddy District Court, shows that Rs.62,91,40,790 (Rs.62.91 
Crores) is due to the respondent-company from Mack Soft; the
amounts due from Mack Soft to the respondent-company is also  
admitted in the counter filed, by Mr. Samson Arthur, to C.A.
No.1163 of 2013;  the fact that a sum of Rs.62.91 crores is due to
QLI from Mack Soft has been suppressed in the counter-affidavit
dated 16.02.2012; Mr. Samson Arthur, on his own admission, was  
an employee of Mack Soft from 01.07.2011; he could not have been 
unaware of these dues; it is nobodys case that Mack Soft was
unable to pay the said sum of Rs.62.91 crores to QLI; in the
counter filed by him in C.A. No.1163 of 2013, all that is stated by
Mr. Samson Arthur is that the fact that QLI was owed money by 
Mack Soft was completely immaterial as it would be a claim to be
made by QLI against Mack Soft; it is relevant to note that Mr.
Samson Arthur did not, in the counter filed in C.A. No.1163 of
2013, even claim to be unaware of this debt of Rs.62.91 crores; in
proceedings for winding up, the financial condition of the company
must be held to be sound, and the company considered  
commercially solvent, when the company which was owed Rs.62.91   
crores by another company, is sought to be wound up for non-
payment of a much lesser sum of Rs.45.00 lakhs; QLI could not, in
such circumstances, be said to financially incapable of repaying
the alleged debt of R.N. Marwah & Company of Rs.45.00 lakhs, 
unless it was unable to recover its dues of Rs.62.91 crores from
Mack Soft; it is not even the case of the appellants that QLI was
unable to recover its dues from Mack Soft or that Mack Soft was
also in financial difficulties and was unable to repay these dues to
QLI; no reference was made even to the bank accounts of QLI in
the counter filed in C.A. No.102 of 2012; Mr. Samson Arthur, in
the affidavit filed by him in support of the caveat petition dated
10.02.2012, stated that the amounts due to R.N. Marwah & 
Company had been repaid; however, in the counter filed by him
less than a week thereafter on 16.02.2012 in C.A. No.102 of 2012,
he readily admitted the liability of QLI towards R.N. Marwah &
Company; one of these two statements is evidently false; and
reference to the bank balances, in the subsequent counter filed in
C.A. No.1163 of 2013, is an afterthought and is referred to
somehow  justify the earlier false statements made on oath before
the Company Court. 
       In the counter-affidavit dated 22.08.2014, filed in C.A. No.
1163 of 2013 in C.P. No.30.2012, Mr. Samson Arthur stated that:-
              . I had resigned from the services of the applicant (QLI) on
31.05.2012 which was effective from May, 2012.. 

          Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-
company, would submit that this statement is also false as Mr.
Samson Arthur had filed an affidavit on 25.06.2015, in the present
appeal before this Court, and had annexed thereto a service
certificate dated 31.08.2012; and, in the said Certificate, it is
stated that:-
                 ..Samson Arthur represented Quinn Property Management Pvt. Ltd.
until 30.06.2011 and subsequently joined the services of Mack Soft Tech Pvt.
Ltd. from 01.07.2011.

      According to Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, if Mr. Samson Arthur
was not even in the employment of QLI, his assertion that he had
resigned from the services of QLI was, evidently, false.  While
expression of any opinion, on the aforesaid submissions of Sri S.
Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would be inappropriate as it
may cause prejudice to Sri Samson Arthur in the proceedings
before the Magistrate, it cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be
said that a prima facie of Mr. Samson Arthur having made false
statements on oath, before the Company Court, has not been made  
out.
          In the Affidavit dated 15.06.2012, filed before the Company
Court, Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao stated:-
           ..The company is not operating for the last one and half year (i.e
January 2011).. 

                   Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-
company, would submit that this statement is false as Form FC-
TRS dated 28.09.2011, purports to show transfer of shares held by
the respondent in Mack Soft to Logvis AG for Rs.9,90,000, even
though these shares were purchased by the respondent in May, 
2007 for Rs.126,73,23,427/-.
                  In the counter-affidavit dated 13.06.2012 filed in C.P. No.30
of 2012 before the Company Court, Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao 
stated:-        
                   ..The only reason for non-payment of the outstanding dues by
respondent company was the prevailing financial condition of the respondent
company..  

         He again stated that:-
         .I submit that the respondent company does not have any assets at
all..
      Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would submit that
sundry debtors of Rs.62.91 Crores  (the amount owed by Mack Soft 
to QLI) constitute the current assets of QLI, and the statement of
Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao that the Company does not have any  
assets at all is false. On the other hand Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior
Counsel, would contend that Sri N. Chandrasekhar Raos 
ignorance of the basic principles of accountancy is evident from the
fact that, while in one breath he stated that the respondent-
company does not have any assets at all, at the same time he
referred to the bank balance of the respondent-company in HDFC 
Bank and HSBC bank without even realising that bank balances 
also constitute the assets of the respondent-company.
      While much has been said about the lack of knowledge of
accountancy, both on the part of Mr. Samson Arthur and Mr. N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, the submission of    Sri S. Niranjan Reddy,
Learned Counsel, that even a layman would know that the 
companys existence should not be brought to an end for a liability
of Rs.45.00 Lakhs when a sum of Rs.62.91 Crores is owed to it by
another company, cannot be said to be without merit.  Sri S.
Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel, would further submit that the
aforesaid statements are evidently false as the audit report, filed by
Mr. N. Chandra Sekhar Rao as representative of Mack Soft before
the Ranga Reddy District Court, shows that Rs.62,91,40,790
(Rs.62.91 Crores) was due to QLI from Mack Soft; the amounts 
due, from Mack Soft to QLI, is also admitted in the counter filed by
Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Rao in C.A. No.1163 of 2013; it is not even
the case of Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao that he was unaware of the
debt due from Mack Soft to QLI of Rs.62.91 crores;  in the counter,
filed in C.A. No.1163 of 2013, Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao stated
that the fact that QLI was owed money by Mack Soft was 
completely immaterial as it would be a claim to be made by QLI
against Mack Soft; in the counter-affidavit filed by him in C.P.
No.30 of 2012, and in the affidavit filed by him in C.A. No.739 of
2012, Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao has not even referred to the fact
that a sum of Rs.62.91 crores is due to QLI from Mack Soft which
is, evidently, deliberate suppression of material and relevant facts.
(c). SUPPRESSIO VERI SUGGESTIO FALSI:       
       If the aforesaid submissions of Sri S. Niranjan Reddy,
Learned Counsel, were to merit acceptance, it would then mean
that relevant facts have been deliberately suppressed from the
Company Court.  If a wrong or misleading statement is deliberately
and willfully made by a party to a litigation with a view to obtain a
favourable order, it would prejudice or interfere with the due
course of the judicial proceeding. (Naraindas v. The Government
of Madhya Pradesh ; Afzal v. State of Haryana ; Sri V.
Satyanarayana Rao v. State of A.P ; S.R. Ramaraj v. Special
Court, Bombay ; V. Satyanarayana Rao6).   "Suppressio veri", i.e.,
the suppression of relevant and material facts is as bad as
Suggestio falsi i.e., a false representation deliberately made. Both
are intended to dilute- one by inaction and the other by action.
"Suppressio veri Suggestio falsi"-suppression of the truth is
equivalent to the suggestion of what is false. (Black's Law
Dictionary with pronounciations-Sixth edition). A false
statement willfully and deliberately made, and a suppression of a
relevant and material fact, interfere with the due course of justice
and obstruct the administration of justice. (V. Satyanarayana
Rao6).
(d). COURT SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY OBSERVATIONS, OTHER              
     THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY:      
      While this submission of suppression of material facts by the
appellants cannot be brushed aside, we refrain from saying
anything more as it would prejudice the cause of the appellants
during the course of proceedings before the Magistrate.  The Court
should not speak more than what is absolutely necessary, as any
expression or observation on any facet of the case may prejudice
either party in the trial which must be free and impartial wherein
no party should have any feeling of misgiving, suspicion or
embarrassment (K. Karunakaran3); no expression, on the guilt or
innocence of the persons, should be made by the Court while
passing an order under Section 340 Cr.P.C; an exercise of the
Court at that stage is not for finding whether any offence was
committed or who committed the same; the scope is confined to 
see whether the Court could then decide, on the materials
available, that the matter requires inquiry by a Criminal Court;
and it is expedient in the interest of justice to have it inquired into.
(Pritish2; M.S. Sheriff v. State of Madras ).
(e). INTERFERENCE IN APPEAL IS JUSTIFIED ONLY IF THE        
     PRIMA FACIE VIEW OF THE COMPANY COURT IS         
     PERVERSE:  

      The Learned Company Judge has, in the order under appeal,
noted that it is not even the case of Sri N. Chandrasekhar Rao, in
the counter-affidavit, that they were unable to recover the amount
from Mack Soft or that Mack Soft was not paying the amount 
which resulted in QLI being disabled from paying the debt due to
M/s. R.N. Marwah & Co.   Interference in appeal can be only on
the basis that the Company Courts prima facie view, that a
complaint should be laid under Section 193 IPC, is so manifestly
perverse, so grossly erroneous and so palpably unjust that the
appellate Court must interfere in the interest of justice and fair
play. (K. Karunakaran3).    The Company Courts prima facie view
does not suffer from any such infirmity.  The Learned Judge has,
in the order under appeal, also made it clear that the Magistrate
should not be influenced by any observations made in the order
since they were made only for the purpose of the preliminary
enquiry under Section 340(1) Cr.P.C. We see no reason, therefore,
to interfere with the order under appeal on merits.
III. NO PROOF THAT FALSE EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN BY THE           
      APPELLANTS THAT TOO INTENTIONALLY:       

        Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellants, would submit that Section 193 IPC requires that
the person giving evidence should intentionally give false
evidence; from the circumstances described above, it cannot be
said that the appellants had given any false evidence, that too
intentionally; there is no evidence on record to rebut that the
financial situation of QLI was anything other than what the bank
balances with HDFC Bank indicated; the Learned Company Judge    
also proceeded on the footing that Mr. N. Chandrasekhar Raos
knowledge about the balance sheet of Mack Soft would reveal that
monies were due from Mack Soft to QLI; prosecution can only be 
launched for intentionally giving false evidence; Mr. Samson
Arthur, without anything more, cannot be presumed to be aware of
the balance sheet of Mack Soft, when he signed the counter
affidavit dated 16.02.2012; the knowledge of Mr. N.
Chandrasekhar Rao, regarding the balance sheet of Mack Soft, and 
that too on a subsequent date at the time of filing pleadings in the
Ranga Reddy District Court cannot form the basis for the Learned
Company Judge to conclude that Mr. Samson Arthur had   
knowledge about the balance-sheet; it is this knowledge alone
which would have established the intention; in the circumstances,
the findings of the Learned Company Judge are erroneous, and the
reasoning is faulty; Mr. Samson Arthur was a management  
professional, and was in the employment of Mack Soft; his role was
that of brokering, marketing, sales advisory, business
development, leasing, negotiating, etc; merely because he had an
MBA degree does not mean that he had knowledge about the   
balance sheet, its contents or its purport; the findings of the
Learned Company Judge is completely based on third party 
knowledge, and is unsustainable; Mr. Samson Arthur had no 
financial stake either in Mack Soft or QLI; he had no shareholding;
he was only an employee; it could not be said that he had any
intention to ensure that a provisional liquidator be appointed
when he filed the affidavit; as a matter of fact, he specifically
denied that QLI and its directors had devised ways and means of
disposing of, alienating, and parting with the assets of QLI to third
parties with a view to defeat the claims of its creditors like M/s. R.
N. Marwah & Co; he had also opposed the passing of an ad-interim 
order restraining QLI, its directors and other principal officers
from, in any manner, transferring, alienating or disposing of the
assets and properties of QLI; he had also denied that QLI should
be wound up, or that an Official Liquidator should be appointed as
the Liquidator of QLI, as any order of the Court would seriously
affect the image of the Company, the interest of the employees, and
would also undo the efforts being put by QLI; he had finally prayed
that the Court may be pleased to dismiss the application; and it
would be a travesty to launch prosecution against Mr. Samson
Arthur for the alleged falsity of the statement contained in his
affidavit dated 16.02.2012.
        On the other hand Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel
for the respondent-company, would submit that an order under
Section 340 Cr.P.C. is only a tentative and a prima facie view; mere
suspicion of probability would suffice for referring the matter to the
Magistrate; the rights of the accused are fully protected;
notwithstanding a reference, the Magistrate can decide on taking
cognizance on the material placed before him; and every defence
available to the accused would also be considered like in the
course of an ordinary criminal trial.
      The fact that a prima facie case has been made out for laying
a complaint, does not mean that the charge has been established
against a person beyond reasonable doubt. That will be thrashed
out in the trial where the parties will have an opportunity to
produce evidence and controvert each others case exhaustively
without any reservation. There may often be a constraint, on the
part of a person sought to be proceeded against under Section 340
CrPC, to come out with all material in the preliminary enquiry.
That constraint will not be there in a regular trial where he will
have ample opportunity to defend himself, and produce all material
to show that an offence under Section 193 IPC has not been made 
out. That section contemplates that making of a false statement is
not enough. It has to be made intentionally. The accused in a trial
under Section 193 will be able to place all circumstances bearing
upon the ingredient of the intention attributed to him. (K.
Karunakaran3). 
      As the question whether or not the statements made before
the Company Court by the appellants were false, and whether
such false statements were intentionally made, are matters of
examination by the Magistrate, and are not matters to be
considered in proceedings under Section 340(1) Cr.P.C, the
Learned Company Judge has rightly not expressed any opinion in 
this regard.
IV. COMPOUNDING OF OFFENCES UNDER IPC:           
        Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellants, would submit that it was now apparent that the
principal warring parties namely IRBC and Mr. Sean Quinn were in
the process of settling their disputes by mediation; the latest
information, published on 01.07.2015, shows that a retired Judge
Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan had agreed to act as a mediator in
the long running dispute between the Quinn family and IBRC; a
copy of the publication was being annexed; the litigation in India is
just an offshoot of the litigation in Ireland between IBRC and the
Quinn family; it is not as if IBRC has lent any separate money to
QLI apart from what it is seeking to recover in the proceedings in
Ireland; IBRCs effort appeared only to secure all the assets of Mr.
Sean Quinn all over the world; the Supreme Court has, in Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab , CBI v. Narendra Lal Jain , and
Nikhil Merchant v. CBI , held that, even where certain offences
may not be compoundable in terms of Section 320 Cr.P.C., the 
Court may, in the interest of justice, quash such complaints; and
in the peculiar circumstances of this case, since the complaint is
emanating from the High Court itself, which would also ultimately
exercise the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the very
complaint that would be instituted in the Court of the Magistrate,
this was a fit case wherein, in the alternative, this Court could
consider permitting the compounding of the alleged offences.
        Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-
company, would submit that, for compounding of offences
punishable under the India Penal Code, a complete scheme is 
provided under Section 320 Cr. P.C; Section 320(1) provides that
the offences mentioned in the table provided thereunder can be
compounded by the persons mentioned in column (3) of the said 
table; Section 320 (2) provides that the offences, mentioned in the
table, can be compoundable by the victim with the permission of
the court; as against this, sub-section (9) specifically provides that
no offence shall be compoundable expect as provided by this
section; in view of the aforesaid legislative mandate, only offences,
which are covered by Table 1 or Table 2 as stated above, can be
compounded; the rest of the offences punishable under the IPC
cannot be compounded; Section 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199,
200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228 and Section 463, 471,
475 or 476 for which punishment, under Section 340 read with
Section 195 Cr.P.C, can be made, have been omitted from Section 
320, and are hence not compoundable.  
      In Nikhil Merchant11, the Supreme Court held that, in the
case before it, the disputes between the Company and the Bank 
had been set at rest on the basis of the compromise arrived at by
them whereunder the dues of the Bank had been cleared, and the 
Bank did not appear to have any further claim against the
Company; what, however, remained was the fact that certain
documents were alleged to have  been created by the appellant in
order to avail credit facilities beyond the limits to which the
Company was entitled; the dispute involved before it had the
overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets; the
question, which was required to be answered, was whether the
power, which independently lay with it to quash criminal
proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at, should be
exercised?;  on an overall view of the facts, keeping in mind the
decision in B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana  and the compromise
arrived at between the Company and the Bank, as also the consent 
terms in the suit filed by the Bank, they were satisfied that this
was a fit case where technicalities should not be allowed to stand
in the way of the quashing of the criminal proceedings since, in
their view, continuance of the same, after the  compromise arrived
at between the parties, would be a futile exercise.
      In Gian Singh9 the Supreme Court held that the power of
the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
complaint, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, is distinct
and different from the power given to a criminal court for
compounding the offences under Section 320 Cr.P.C; in what cases 
power, to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR, may
be exercised, where the offender and the victim have settled their
dispute, would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
case, and no category can be prescribed; however, before exercise
of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature
and gravity of the crime; heinous and serious offences of mental
depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be
quashed even though the victim or victims family and the offender
have settled the dispute; such offences were not private in nature,
and had a serious impact on society; similarly, any compromise
between the victim and the offender in relation to the offences
under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the
offences committed by public servants while working in that
capacity, etc cannot provide any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences; but criminal cases having a
civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly offences arising from commercial, financial,
mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or offences
arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or family disputes
where the wrong was basically private or personal in nature, and
the parties had resolved their entire dispute; in this category of
cases, the High Court could quash the criminal proceedings if in
its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the
victim, the possibility of conviction was remote and bleak, and
continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great
oppression and prejudice, and extreme injustice would be caused
to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
settlement and compromise with the victim; the High Court must
consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the 
wrongdoer and whether, to secure the ends of justice, it is
appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end; if the answer to
the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be
well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding; and it
cannot be said that B.S. Joshi12, Nikhil Merchant11 and Manoj
Sharma v. State  were not correctly decided.
      In Narendra Lal Jain10, the Supreme Court held that the
civil liability of the respondents to pay the amount to the Bank had
already been settled amicably; no subsisting grievance of the Bank
in this regard had been brought to the notice of the Court; while
the offence under Section 420 IPC was compoundable, the offence 
under Section 120-B IPC is not; to the latter offence the ratio laid
down in B.S. Joshi12 and Nikhil Merchant11 would apply if the
facts of the given case would so justify; having regard to the fact
that the liability, to make good the monetary loss suffered by the
Bank, had been mutually settled between the parties, and the
accused had accepted the liability in this regard, the High Court
had thought it fit to invoke its power under Section 482 CrPC; they
did not see how such exercise of power can be faulted or held to be
erroneous; and continuance of a criminal proceeding, which was
likely to become oppressive or may partake the character of a lame
prosecution, would be a good ground to invoke the extraordinary
power under Section 482 CrPC. 
      It is for the first time, in the present appeal, that this
submission, of the dispute between Mr. Sean Quinn and IRBC  
being referred to mediation, is made.   The mere fact that the
dispute between Mr. Sean Quinn and IRBC has been referred to 
mediation does not necessitate the conclusion that the parties
would arrive at an amicable settlement justifying compounding of
the offences alleged against the appellants.   It is also debatable
whether the appellate Court, under Clause 15 of the Letters
Patent, can compound these offences simultaneously exercising 
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.  It must also be borne in
mind that the submission, urged on behalf of the respondent-
company, if true, would mean that the appellants have sought to
misuse the process of the Company Court, and have obtained 
orders from the Company Court misrepresenting and suppressing  
material facts.  False averments, which interfere with the
administration of justice, cannot be ignored or brushed aside, and
are matters which ought to be examined by the Magistrate under
Section 340 Cr.P.C.
(a). FALSE STATEMENTS AND SUPPRESSION OF MATERIAL             
     FACTS, WHICH AFFECT THE SOLEMNITY OF COURT          
     PROCEEDINGS, SHOULD NOT BE READILY CONDONED:             

      There is no justification in the request, made on behalf of the
appellants, that the offences be compounded.  The public have an
interest, an abiding and a real interest, and a vital stake in the
effective and orderly administration of justice.  Unless justice is so
administered, there is the peril of all rights and liberties perishing.
The Court has the duty of protecting the interest of the public in
the due administration of justice. (Advocate General State of
Bihar v. Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries ; V. Satyanarayana
Rao6).   In order to sustain and maintain the sanctity and
solemnity of proceedings in law courts it is necessary that parties
should not make false or, knowingly, inaccurate statements or
misrepresentation and/or should not conceal material facts with a
design to gain some advantage or benefit at the hands of the Court
where truth and justice are the solemn pursuits. If any party
attempts to pollute such a place by recourse to misrepresentation,
and conceals material facts, he does so at his own risk. Such a
party must be ready to take the consequences that follow.  There is
a compelling need to take a serious view in such matters to ensure
purity in the administration of justice. (Vijay Syal v. State of
Punjab ).  As a petition containing misleading and inaccurate
statements, if filed to achieve an ulterior purpose, amounts to an
abuse of the process of the court, the litigant should not be dealt
with lightly.  A litigant is bound to make full and true disclosure of
facts. (Manohar Lal v. Ugrasen ; Tilokchand and Motichand v.
H.B. Munshi ).  Whenever the court comes to the conclusion that
its process is being abused, it would be justified in refusing to
proceed further. This rule has been evolved out of the need for
courts to deter a litigant from abusing its process by deceit.
(Manohar Lal16; State of Haryana v. Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. ;
Sabia Khan v. State of U.P. ; Abdul Rahman v. Prasony Bai ;
S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd. v. State of Bihar  and
Oswal Fats & Oils Ltd. v. Commr. (Admn.) ).  It is the duty of
the High Court to ensure that its judicial process is not abused,
and its order does not become an instrument or aid to overreach
the adversary. (M.V. Venkataramana Bhat v. Returning Officer
and Tahsildar ).    Every person invoking the jurisdiction of the
Court must state the truth, be it in the pleadings, affidavits or
evidence. The pleadings must set-forth sufficient factual details
which inspire confidence and credibility. (A. Shanmugam v. Ariya
Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nand Havana    
Paripalanai Sangam Represented by its President ). It is the
duty of the Court,  once false averment of facts are discovered, to
take appropriate steps to ensure that no one derives any benefit or
advantage by abusing the legal process.  Fraudulent and dishonest
litigants must be discouraged. (A. Shanmugam24).  It is the
bounden obligation of the Court to neutralize any unjust and/or
undeserved benefit or advantage obtained by abusing the judicial
process.  (A. Shanmugam24).  
      Dishonesty should not be permitted to bear fruit and confer
benefit to the person who has made a misrepresentation. (District
Collector and Chairman, Vizianagaram Social Welfare 
Residential School Society, Vizianagaram v. M. Tripura
Sundari Devi ; Union of India v. M. Bhaskaran ; Vice
Chairman, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. v. Girdharilal
Yadav ; State of Maharashtra v. Ravi Prakash Babulalsing
Parmar ; Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. v. Coal Tar
Refining Company ; Mohammed Ibrahim v. State of Bihar ; 
and Meghmala v. G. Narasimha Reddy ).   A person, whose case   
is based on falsehood, can be summarily thrown out at any stage
of the litigation.  (S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by LRs. v.
Jagannath (Dead) by LRs. ).  Grave allegations are levelled
against the appellants herein of having deliberately and
consciously made false statements on oath, of having suppressed 
material facts, and to have misled the Company Court into passing
an order appointing a provisional liquidator and, thereafter, into
passing an order of winding up.  These allegations, if true, would
mean that the process of the Court has been abused.  It is
therefore expedient, in the interest of justice, that the matter is
enquired into and action is taken by lodging a complaint before the
Magistrate.  Compounding offences, where litigants are alleged to
have abused the process of Court, may not be justified.   We find
no merit in the submission of Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel,
that the offences, alleged to have been committed by the
appellants, should be compounded. 
V. MAINTAINABILITY OF THE APPEAL:      
        Sri S. Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellants, would submit that, as held by the Full Bench of the
Delhi High Court, in Weizmann Ltd. v. Ms. Shoes East Ltd. , an
intra-Court appeal is maintainable.  On the other hand Sri S.
Niranjan Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-company, 
would submit that the provisions of Sections 340  and 341 Cr.P.C
indicate that there is no appeal against the orders of the High
Court which would include the orders of the Single Judge of the
High Court; this right of appeal was expressly and deliberately
taken away making a departure from Section 476B of the old
Code; the  judgment of the Delhi High Court Full Bench, in
Weizmann Ltd.33 wherein it was held that an appeal, under
Section 341 Cr.P.C, is maintainable is based on two erroneous
presumptions viz., (i) that the Law Commission recommendations 
were premised on M.S. Sheriff8, which is not so; and (ii) that the
Supreme Court, in P.S. Sathappan (Dead) by LRs Vs. Andhra   
Bank Ltd. , specified that, unless there is an express exclusion of
the Letters Patent Act, the said Act would apply; in fact, in P.S.
Sathappan34, the Supreme Court upheld the position that an
appeal, under the Letters Patent, can be taken away by an express
provision in an appropriate legislation, and the express provision
need not refer to or use the words letters patent, but if, on a
reading of the provision, it is clear that all further appeals are
barred then even a letters latent appeal would be barred; and it
was held that a specific exclusion may be clear from the words of a
statute even though no specific reference is made to Letters Patent.
      In K. Karunakaran3 the Supreme Court held that an order
of the High Court, made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of
Section 340 Cr.P.C, is specifically excluded for the purpose of an
appeal to the superior court under Section 341(1) CrPC.  In P.S.
Sathappan34, the Supreme Court held that the provision of appeal
in the Letters Patent could not be excluded by implication; and, in
view of Section 4 CPC, appeals filed under clause 15 of the Letters
Patent were maintainable.  In Weizmann Ltd.33, the Full Bench of
the Delhi High Court held that the expression other than the High
Court in Section 341 Cr.P.C. would not disable an aggrieved party
from preferring an appeal, if it is otherwise maintainable, under
other statutes and provisions of law; the decision, taken on an
application under Section 340 Cr.P.C involves only a formation of
opinion whether or not a complaint should be filed; at the stage of
formation of such an opinion, the court does not exercise criminal
jurisdiction; and, therefore, an appeal under Letters Patent would
be available to the aggrieved party.
      As we are satisfied that the order of the Learned Company
Judge does not necessitate interference on merits, it is wholly
unnecessary for us to examine the contention of Sri S. Niranjan
Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent-company, that no 
intra-Court appeal lies to a Division bench, under Clause 15 of the
Letters Patent, against an order passed under Section 340 and 341
Cr.P.C.  The question of maintainability of the appeal is, therefore,
left open.
VI. CONCLUSION:   
      Viewed from any angle the order of the Learned Company
Judge, in directing the Registrar (Judicial) to depute an officer, not
below the rank of Assistant Registrar, to file a complaint under
Section 340(1) Cr.P.C. read with Sections 191, 193 and 209 IPC
against the appellants herein before a Magistrate of competent
jurisdiction at Hyderabad, is in accordance with law and does not
necessitate interference. We reiterate that the Magistrate, on
receipt of the complaint, shall consider the same in accordance
with law uninfluenced by any observations made either in this
order or in the order under appeal.  Both the appeals fail and are,
accordingly, dismissed.   The miscellaneous petitions pending, if
any, shall also stand dismissed.  No costs.

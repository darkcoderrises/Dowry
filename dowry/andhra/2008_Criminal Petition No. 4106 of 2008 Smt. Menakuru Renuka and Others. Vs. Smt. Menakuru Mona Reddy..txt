Criminal Petition No. 4106 of 2008

22-10-2008 

Smt. Menakuru Renuka and Others.   

Smt. Menakuru Mona Reddy.   
2.State of A.P. rep. By Public Prosecutor,
High Court of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad. 

Counsel for Petitioners :  C.Praveen Kumar.

Counsel for Respondent1: K.M.Mahender Reddy.   

:Order:

        This petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is filed by the petitioners, who
are respondent Nos. 2 to 4 in D.V.C. No. 1 of 2008 on the file of the learned
Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Pulivendula, Kadapa District.  The first
respondent herein, who is the complainant (herein after called as the
complainant) in the above D.V.C., filed the complaint under Section 12 of the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (for short 'the Act')
claiming reliefs under Sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Act.

2.      According to the complainant, her marriage with M.S. Mahender Reddy son of 
the first and second petitioners and the brother of the third petitioner herein
was performed on 29.06.1997. According to the complainant, huge amount to a tune 
of Rs.1.00 crore was given to the petitioners apart from several other articles.
After the marriage,
the spouses lived in United States of America for some time.
There was harassment by the husband, even after the birth of a child.  Even
after they returned to India, there was harassment by the husband, as well as
parents-in-law, including the sister-in-law.  It is the case of the complainant
that not only she, but her father was assaulted by the present petitioners.  In
the D.V.C., she sought reliefs of separate residence, compensation of Rs.8.00
crores and Rs.1.50 Lakhs towards house hold expenses.  

3.      The contention of the petitioners is that even if the entire allegations
in the complaint are taken to be true also, the provisions of the Act would not
attract against present petitioner Nos. 1 and 3, as under Section 2 (q) of the
Act, women are not liable and the reliefs that are now being claimed by the
petitioners can be granted against the husband only and not from any other
member of the family, including the present second petitioner, father-in-law.
It is also the contention of the petitioners that the complainant has also filed
a case against the petitioners and her husband under Section 498-A IPC and
Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act in Crime No.77 of 2008 of
Pulivendula Police Station that was registered on 12.6.2008, which perhaps is a
counter blast to the report given by the second petitioner herein at Varthuru
Police Station, Bangalore City on 6.6.2008.

4.      A reading of the complaint given to the Protection Officer would show that
the complainant was continuously harassed at USA, as well as in India, in
several ways.  While they were in USA,  the present petitioners - parents-in-law
and sister-in-law were instigating her husband to harass her and after they came
to India also, all the family members of the husband, including the sister-in-
law harassed her and they even assaulted her and her father.  In the DVC, the
complainant claimed protection under Section 18; provision for residence under
Section 19; maintenance under Section 20 and compensation under Section 22 of  
the Act.

5.      In the counter filed on behalf of the first respondent, the allegations in
her complaint are repeated mostly and it is contended that the acts of the
present petitioners and her husband attract the provisions of the Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005; proviso to Section 2 (q) makes women   
also liable, her husband, parents-in-law and sister-in-law are liable under this
Act.  According to her, the third petitioner herein, her sister-in-law, used to
influence her husband and other family members; she along with her parents
instigated and abetted physical violence against her and that criminal cases by
both sides have nothing to do with the present case.

6.      Learned Senior Counsel - Sri C. Padmanabha Reddy, appearing  
for the petitioners contends that in view of the provisions of
Section 2 (q) of the Act, women are not liable and for that reason the
proceedings against them have to be quashed.  It is the next contention of the
learned senior counsel that the relief claimed in the DVC cannot be claimed
against any of the petitioners and for that reason also the proceedings have to
be quashed against the petitioners.

7.      On the other hand, Sri D. Prakash Reddy, learned Senior counsel appearing
for the respondent, contends that in view of proviso to
Section 2 (q) of the Act, the DVC is maintainable against women i.e., petitioner
Nos.1 and 3 also and the claims made by the first respondent are maintainable
against all the petitioners herein, who are the
parents-in-law and sister-in-law.

8.      Now, two questions would arise for consideration:
--      First is whether the proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act are
maintainable against women in view of Section 2 (q) of the Act; and

--      Second would be whether the reliefs claimed by the first respondent-
complainant are maintainable against the petitioners herein.


9.      As far as the first question is concerned, Section 2 (q) of the Act reads
as under:
"Respondent" means any adult male person who is, or has been, in a domestic 
relationship with the aggrieved person and against whom the aggrieved person has
sought any relief under the Act:

Provided that an aggrieved wife or female living in a relationship in the nature
of a marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the husband or the
male partner".


10.     Thus, the Section says "respondent" means any adult male person, there by 
excluding women altogether; but the proviso provides for filing complaint
against the relatives of the husband or a male partner.
In view of the same, the learned senior counsel appearing for the first
respondent wife contends that women are also liable.

11.     As contended, the proviso to Section 2(q) is giving scope for including
female relatives of the husband also.  Here, any doubt as to whether a female
relative can be included, perhaps, is clear from the main Section 2 (q), it
covers, the persons having domestic relationship.
As per Section 2 (f) of the Act, "domestic relation" would "include persons that
any time lived together in a shared house hold, when they are related by
consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the nature of marriage,
adoption or are family members living together as joint family".
Thus, this would cover close members of the husband's family like mother-in-law,
sister-in-law, co-sisters etc.  Thus, thereby excluding them (female members of
the domestic relationship) from being the respondents, when the Section says
adult male persons of the domestic relationship are included, female members of
the domestic relationship have to be automatically excluded or else Section 2
(q) of the Act would have been "respondent' means "any adult person" instead of
"any adult male person".  Thus, the question of selfsame female member in
domestic relationship excluded as respondent in view of the contents of the main
provision again being included under the proviso to the Section may not arise.
Therefore, it has to be treated that the proviso intends to include only male
persons other than those in domestic relationship also.
There appears to be unintentional omission to specifically excluding women in
the proviso or it may be because main Section makes it clear that only male
persons can be respondents, it is not again specified in the proviso.

12.     Clause 4 (1) of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act reads as
follows:
"It covers those women who are or have been in a relationship with the abuser
where both parties have lived together in a shared household and are related by
consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the nature of marriage or
adoption.  In addition, relationships with family members living together as a
joint family are also included. Event hose women who are sisters, widows,
mothers, single women, or living with the abuser are entitled to legal
protection under the proposed legislation.  However, whereas the Bill enables
the wife or the female living in a relationship in the nature of marriage to
file a complaint under the proposed enactment against any relative of the
husband or the male partner, it does not enable any female relative of the
husband or the male partner to file a complaint against the wife or the female
partner.

Thus, it would not enable a female relation of husband or a male partner to file
a complaint against wife or female partner.

13.     As per Section 2 (a) of the Act, "aggrieved person" means any women who 
is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the respondent and who alleges
to have been subjected to any act of domestic violence by the respondent". As
per Section 2 (f) "domestic relationship" as already referred is "a relationship
between two persons, who live or have, at any point of time, lived together in a
shared household, when they are related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a
relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living
together as a joint family.
Thus, when Section 2 (a) and (f) of the Act are read together, a case of
Domestic Violence can be filed by any woman in Domestic relationship, not only
by the wife.  Wife is generally taken as the wife of the main respondent, who
again is, mostly, a son in the family.  The above referred Clause 4 (1) of the
Statement of Objects and Reasons and Section 2(a) of the Act clarifies that even
those women, who are sisters, widows, mothers and single women, living with the
abuser are entitled to legal protection under the Act.  Thus aggrieved sisters
and mothers also can file a DVC and when the intention of the Act is to prevent
any female relation of the husband or the male partner to file a DVC against the
wife or the female partner, when a DVC is filed by a wife against the brother of
her husband, when a sister or mother filed a DVC under the Act against several
male members of the family, the question would be who would be wife or female
partner that would be entitled to immunity.  In such an event,
all the wives against whose husbands the DVCs are filed are obviously entitled
to immunity.  Here, a question may arise as to when DVC is filed only against a
female without including her husband like the third petitioner herein or against
unmarried girls, what would be the position.  My answer is, the intention of the
Act is to altogether exclude women, when most women are excluded there is no 
question of the Act intending to include people like unmarried girls.  Thus, it
appears that the intention of the Act is to exclude women altogether.

 14.    In Ajay Kant v. Alka Sharma1, a single Judge of Madhya Pradesh High 
Court held that "the persons referred to in the proviso of
Section 2 (q) of the Act are the persons against whom a complaint can be filed
under Sections 31(2) and 33 of the Act, that as there is no definition for the
word "complaint" in the Act and, since as per Section 2(d) Cr.P.C., complaint
means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to
his taking action under Cr.P.C. that some person, whether known or unknown, has
committed an offence, but does not include a police report, that a complaint can
be filed for two offences mentioned in Sections 31(2) and 33 of the Act and the
word "complaint" that appeared in proviso to Section 2(q) of the Act is only to
give right to the aggrieved women to give complaint for contravention of
Sections 31(2) and 33 of the Act, but not to include them as respondents in a
DVC. 

15.     There appears to be some confusion in the above decision,
as 31(1) of the Act reads that "a breach of protection order, or of an interim
protection order, by the respondent shall be an offence under this Act and shall
be punishable.........", which again shows that the penalty can be only against
the respondent and the question is who is respondent.  Section 33 of the Act
contemplates action against protection officer, who fails to discharge his
duties as directed by the Magistrate in the protection order without any
sufficient cause.  Here again, the question of failing to discharge the duties
of protection officer would arise only in relation to a respondent in the DVC,
thereby leading to the same confusion as to who is respondent.
        
16.     Here, it is pertinent to refer to Section 2 (o) of the Act, which says
"protection order" means an order made in terms of Section 18' and Section 18 of
the Act provides that the order is contemplated only against the respondent.
        
17.     In the above circumstances, the decision in Ajay Kant's Case (Supra 1) may
not be of any substantial guidance.

18.     In view of my above discussion, I hold that female members cannot be made
respondents in the proceedings under the Act.

19.     Coming to the question of the reliefs claimed by the first respondent
before the trial court under Sections 18 to 22 of the Act are concerned -
Section 18 of the Act deals with grant of a protection order from domestic
violence; from alienating any assets, operating bank lockers etc. which can be
definitely granted against the present second petitioner - father-in-law. An
order under Section 19, an order for residence, can also be granted against the
second petitioner.  The reliefs under Sections 20 and 22 also can be granted
against the second petitioner, father-in-law.

20.     Learned senior counsel appearing for the second petitioner relied on a
decision of our High Court in Mohammed Maqeenuddin Ahmed v. State of A.P.2.  
This is a case where compensation for medical expenses was granted against 
father-in-law. Perhaps, the above decision is not applicable to the facts of the
present case, in view of the nature of the claims made by the complainant
herein.  In the circumstances, I hold that the reliefs can be granted against
the second petitioner.

21.      In view of the above finding, as the question of maintainability of the
proceedings against the female members is held in favour of petitioner Nos. 1
and 3 herein, holding that proceedings under the Act are not maintainable
against the female members, the proceedings are liable to be quashed, as far as
petitioner Nos.1 and 3 herein are concerned. Accordingly, the present petition
is allowed to the extent of petitioner Nos.1 and 3, quashing the proceedings
pending against them in D.V.C. No.1 of 2008 on the file of the learned Judicial
Magistrate of First Class, Pulivendula, Kadapa District.  The petition in so far
as it relates to the second petitioner is hereby dismissed.

22.     In the result, the Criminal Petition is ordered accordingly.

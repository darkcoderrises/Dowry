The State of A.P. rep. by its Public Prosecutor, High Court         of A.P.,
Hyderabad. 

Counsel for the Appellant: MR. C.Praveen Kumar 

Counsel for the Respondent : The Public Prosecutor

:JUDGMENT:   

This criminal appeal is directed against the judgment dated 13.10.2003
passed in Sessions Case No.405 of 1999 on the file of the II Additional
Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad, whereby the learned Additional
Metropolitan Sessions Judge found A-1 P.Laxma Reddy guilty for the offence under
Section 304-B I.P.C. and convicted him accordingly and sentenced him to suffer
rigorous imprisonment for seven years.  However, the learned Additional
Metropolitan Sessions Judge found A-2 C.Sudheer Reddy, A-3 S.Dinesh Reddy @    
Dinesh, A-4 C.Bharathi and   A-5 S.Indira Reddy not guilty for the offence under
Section 304-B I.P.C. and acquitted them accordingly.

2.The appellant is A-1 in Sessions Case No.405 of 1999.  He along with four
other accused persons (A-2 to A-5) was put on trial for the offence under
Section 304-B I.P.C.

3.The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows: P.W.1 Ch.Surender Reddy is
father and P.W.2 Ch.Pawan Reddy is brother of Praveena (hereinafter referred to
as 'the deceased').  P.W.3 D.Asha Latha and P.W.5 M.Annapurna are neighbours to  
P.W.1.  P.W.4 Ch.Venkata Krishna Reddy is nephew of P.W.1.  P.W.6 K.Laxmi is    
sister-in-law of P.W.1 being the sister of his wife.  The marriage of the
deceased was fixed with the A-1 in the year 1997.  Betrothal function was held
on 27.05.1997.  P.W.1 agreed to give 40 tolahs of gold, furniture worth of
Rs.50,000/- and other household articles.  P.W.1 gave Rs.1,00,000/- to A-1 on
the date of betrothal function. Marriage was performed on 19.06.1997.  After the
marriage the deceased joined with A-1 for marital life.  P.W.1 agreed to give a
house plot worth Rs.6,00,000/- to the deceased.  The deceased and A-1 started
living in a house at Gudimalkapur.  The deceased led happy marital life for six
months.  It is alleged that A-1 started pressurizing the deceased to get cash
instead of plot from her father-P.W.1.  A-1 declined the invitation of P.W.1 for
dasara festival as well as 'Satyanarayana Vratam'.  P.W.1 gave Rs.1,00,000/- to
the deceased and A-1 in February, 1998.  On 07.06.1998 'Srimantham' function of
the deceased was arranged.  A-1 and members of his family attended the function.
It is alleged that A-1 expressed his anguish for not giving cash by selling
plot.  On 10.06.1998 the deceased left her parental home.  On 15.06.1998 the
deceased informed P.W.1 over phone that she would come to his house on  
17.06.1998 as 19.06.1998 happened to be their marriage day. P.W.1 invited the
deceased to come along with A-1.  It is stated that the deceased asked P.W.1 to
give money for purchasing clothes to A-1.  On 16.06.1998 P.W.1 met the father of
A-1 at Basheerabagh, where sister of A-1 resides.  He reiterated his promise to
give a plot instead of cash.  Thereupon, the father of A-1 informed him that he
would convince A-1.  On the same day evening P.W.1 returned home and learnt that 
his wife received a phone call from the deceased.  The deceased stated to have
informed her mother that her father-in-law chastised A-1 and so, A-1 may not
insist further to sell plot.  On 17.06.1998 at about 11.40 p.m. A-1 informed
P.W.1 that the deceased consumed poison.  Immediately P.W.1 rushed to the house   
of A-1 and from there to Niharika Hospital.  He learnt that the deceased was
shifted to C.D.R. Hospital, and therefore, he rushed to the hospital and saw
A-2 to A-4 there.  The deceased while undergoing treatment died on 18.06.1998 at
7.30 p.m.   P.W.1 presented Ex.P.1 report before the Station House Officer,
Tappachabutra Police Station.  P.W.8 received Ex.P.1 report and registered a
case in Crime No.70 of 1998 and issued Ex.P.5-F.I.R.  He sent a requisition to
the Mandal Executive Magistrate to conduct inquest on the dead body of the
deceased.  P.W.7, the Mandal Executive Magistrate, Hyderabad, held inquest on 
the dead body of the deceased on 19.06.1998.  The opinion arrived at by the
panchas came to be incorporated in Col. 15 of the inquest report.  Ex.P.4 is the
inquest report.  After the inquest, the dead body was sent for postmortem
examination. A team of doctors comprising P.W.9 Dr.Durdana Begum, and Dr.   
T.Mahender Reddy, Assistant Professors in Forensic Medicine, Osmania Medical   
College, Hyderabad, held autopsy over the dead body of the deceased on
19.06.1998 at 1.30 p.m.  No external injuries were found. They preserved Viscera
and sent the same to F.S.L.  After receipt of the F.S.L. Report, a final opinion
came to be issued stating that the deceased died of Organophosphate (an
insecticide poisoning).  Ex.P.8 is the Postmortem examination report. Ex.P.9 is
the F.S.L. report and Ex.P.10 is the final opinion.  P.W.8 inspected the scene
of offence and prepared Ex.P.6 observation report and Ex.P.7 rough sketch in the
presence of the mediators viz., M.Venkateshwar Rao and Yadamma Reddy. He    
examined P.W.1 to P.W.5 and recorded their statements.  He arrested  A-1 to A-3
and A-5 on 23.06.1998 and sent them for remand.  P.W.10 A.B.Pratap Reddy,  
A.C.P., D.D., Hyderabad, took up investigation, examined P.W.6 and recorded his
statement.  After completing the investigation, a charge sheet came to be
submitted before the IX Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad.
4.The learned Magistrate took the charge sheet on file as P.R.C.No.26 of
1999 and committed the case to the Metropolitan Sessions Division, Hyderabad, as
the offence under Section 304-B I.P.C. is exclusively triable by the Court of
Session.    The learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge took the case on file as
Sessions Case No.405 of 1999 and made over the same to the II Additional
Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad, for disposal according to Law.

5.The learned II Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, on hearing the
prosecution and the accused, framed a charge under Section 304-B I.P.C. against
the accused, read over and explained the same to them.  The accused pleaded not 
guilty and claimed to be tried.

6.To bring home the guilt of the accused for the offence under Section 304-B
I.P.C., the prosecution examined ten witnesses and proved ten documents.  The
accused examined the landlord of the house, wherein A-1 and the deceased resided 
together, as D.W.1 and marked a contradiction in the statement of P.W.2 recorded
under Section 161 Cr.P.C. as Ex.D-1.

7.The learned II Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, on considering the
evidence on record and on hearing the prosecution and the accused, found A-1
guilty for the offence under Section 304-B I.P.C. and convicted him accordingly
and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years. However, the
learned II Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge found A-2 to A-5 not guilty
for the offence under Section 304-B I.P.C. and acquitted them accordingly.
Assailing the judgment of conviction and sentence, A-1 has filed this criminal
appeal.

8.Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant/A-1 submits that P.W.1
does not own a house plot and therefore, the story narrated by P.W.1 that the
appellant/A-1 insisted him to sell house plot and pay cash of Rs.6,00,000/-
cannot be believed. He also submits that the trial Court has missed to note that
the deceased never complained against the appellant/A-1 to her father-P.W.1 and
that itself is sufficient to prove that the marital life of the deceased with
appellant/A-1 has been cordial. It is also submitted by him that the evidence of
P.W.5 is quite artificial and therefore, no credence can be given to it.

9.The learned Public Prosecutor submits that the evidence of P.W.1 is
corroborated by the evidence of P.W.6 and that the trial Court justified in
recording conviction of the appellant/A-1 for the offence under Section 304-B
I.P.C. and the same is not required to be interfered with in the appeal.

10.Section 304-B I.P.C. deals with dowry death, which reads as follows:
"304-B. Dowry death - (1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or
bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven
years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was
subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband
for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called
"dowry death", and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her
death.
Explanation-For the purpose of this sub-section, ''dowry'' shall
have the same meaning as in S.2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).
(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment  
for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to
imprisonment for life."

11.In order to attract application of Section 304-B I.P.C., the essential
ingredients are as follows:
i) The death of a woman should be caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise
than under a normal circumstance; 
ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage;
iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any
relative of her husband;
iv)  Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand of
dowry;
v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to the woman soon 
before her death.

12.Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is also relevant for the case at hand.
Both Section 304-B I.P.C. and Section  113-B of the Evidence Act were inserted
by the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, (43 of 1986), with a view to combat
the increasing menace of dowry deaths.    Section 113-B of the Evidence Act
reads as follows:-
"113-B. Presumption as to dowry death:- When the question is whether a person 
has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her
death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, 
or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such
person had caused the dowry death. 
Explanation:- For the purpose of this section, ''dowry death'', shall have
the same meaning as in S.304-B of the Indian Penal Code (45 OF 1860). 

13.The presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, shall be raised
only on proof of the following essential ingredients:
1) The question before the Court must be whether the accused has committed the 
dowry death of a woman. (This means that the presumption can be raised only if
the accused is being tried for the offence under Section  304-B  I.P.C.).
2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his 
relatives.
3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in connection with any demand for
dowry.
4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.

14.The determination of the period which can come within the term 'soon
before' is left to be determined by the Courts, depending upon facts and
circumstances of each case.  Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression
'soon before' would normally imply that the interval should not be much between
the concerned cruelty or harassment and the death in question.  There must be
existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on
dowry demand and the concerned death.  If alleged incident of cruelty is remote
in time and has become stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the
woman concerned, it would be of no consequence.  

15.Consequences of cruelty which are likely to drive a woman to commit
suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health, whether
mental or physical of the woman is required to be established in order to bring
home the application of Section 498-A I.P.C.  Cruelty has been defined in the
explanation for the purpose of Section 498-A I.P.C.  Substantive Section 498-A
I.P.C. and presumptive Section 113-B of the Evidence Act have been inserted in
the respective statutes by Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983.  It is to
be noted that Sections 304-B I.P.C. and 498-A I.P.C. cannot be held to be
mutually inclusive.  These provisions deal with two distinct offences.  It is
true that cruelty is a common essential to both the sections and that has to be
proved.  The Explanation to Section 498-A I.P.C. gives the meaning of 'cruelty'.
In S.304-B I.P.C. there is no such explanation about the meaning of 'cruelty'.
But having regard to common background to these offences it has to be taken that
the meaning of 'cruelty' or 'harassment' is the same as prescribed in the
Explanation to Section 498-A I.P.C. under which 'cruelty' by itself amounts to
an offence.  Under Section 304-B I.P.C. it is 'dowry death' that is punishable
and such death should have occurred within seven years of marriage.  No such
period is mentioned in Section 498-A I.P.C.  A person charged and acquitted
under Section 304-B I.P.C. can be convicted under Section 498-A I.P.C. without
that charge being there, if such a case is made out.  If the case is
established, there can be a conviction under both the sections.  Section 498-A
I.P.C. and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act include in their amplitude past
events of cruelty.  Period of operation of Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is
seven years, presumption arises when a woman committed suicide within a period 
of seven years from the date of marriage.

16.(a) The marriage of the deceased with A-1 was on 19.06.1997.  The death of
the deceased was on 18.06.1998 and it was due to organophosphate (an insecticide 
poison).  It can be said without any controversy that the deceased died within
seven years of her marriage and her death occurred otherwise than under a normal
circumstance.  The crucial question is whether the deceased was subjected to
harassment soon before her death.  According to the prosecution, A-1 was
insisting the deceased to secure cash of Rs.6,00,000/- instead of plot which
P.W.1 promised to give on the date of the marriage.  I may quickly refer to the
report presented by P.W.1.  It is stated by him in Ex.P.1 report that he gave
Rs.1,00,000/- to meet the demand of the appellant/A-1 and that the appellant/A-
1, in connivance with the other accused, killed the deceased.  (b) The deceased
came to the house of P.W.1 on 07.06.1998 and stayed there till 10.06.1998.
P.W.1 did not claim of the deceased informing him about the harassment on the
ground of securing a sum of Rs.6,00,000/- instead of plot.  P.W.1 stated

in the chief-examination as follows:
"Prior to giving Rs.1,00,000/- in February, 1998 A-1 did not come to my house
when I invited him for Dasara and for Satyanarayana Vratham.  After giving cash
of Rs.1,00,000/- I asked my daughter to convince A-1 and bring him to our house.
When my daughter became pregnant we performed 'Srimantham' in our house on    
07.06.1998.  A-1 and his family members attended the function.  Then A-1 was in
anger.  I felt that he was angry because I did not sell the plot and give cash
to him.  He went back to his house on that day itself.
On 10.06.1998 my daughter returned back to the house of A-1 on 
receiving phone call from A-1 informing her that he was suffering with fever.
On 15.06.1998 my daughter informed me over telephone that she will
come to my house on 17th June, 1998 as 19.06.1998 was their marriage day.  Then  
I asked her to come with A-1.  Then she asked me to give money to purchase 
cloths for her and A-1.  She also enquired with me what we were doing regarding
the plot.  I told her that I will discuss the matter with the father of A-1.
On 16.06.1998 morning I went and met the father of A-1 in the house
of his daughter in Basheerbagh.  I informed him that I promised to give plot and
not the cash. I also told him that I will give the plot to my daughter.  He told
me that he will convince his son. I returned back to my house."

( c )It is explicit from the evidence of P.W.1 that the deceased stayed at the
house of P.W.1 from 07.06.1998 to 10.06.1998 and subsequently she talked to him 
over phone.  She never complained against the appellant/A-1.  Indeed, P.W.1 did
not sail with the prosecution, and therefore, prosecution declared him hostile
and cross-examined him after obtaining permission from the Court.  In the cross-
examination, he gave all the answers favourable to the prosecution.  In the
cross examination on behalf of the accused, P.W.1 admits of his omission in the
statement made before M.R.O. during inquest regarding the deceased informing him 
personally or over telephone the demands of the accused.  He states in the
cross-examination as follows:
"I did not state before M.R.O. and also in Ex.P.1 that 15.06.1998 my daughter
telephoned me and informed me that A-1 put a dead line for selling the plot and
that it seems he wasn't allow her to stay in the house unless the plot is sold,
and harassing her".

When such is the evidence of P.W.1, it is not safe to place reliance on it.

17.The trial Court rejected the evidence of P.W.2, who is brother of the
deceased by giving cogent and convincing reasons. P.W.3 is a neighbour to P.W.1.
According to her, she went to the house of P.W.1 to invite the wife of P.W.1 for
the marriage of her daughter.  Then she made enquiries with the deceased and
learnt of demands of the appellant/A-1.  In the cross-examination, she admits of
her stating to Police that she met the deceased while passing Surendra Reddy's
house and accosted her.  I deem it appropriate to refer the cross examination of
P.W.3 in her own words and it is thus:
" Excepting in connection with the invitation for the marriage of my daughter,
there was no occasion for me to go to the house of P.W.1 on that day.  It is not
true to say that I did not state in my 161 Cr.P.C. statement that on 04.06.1998
I went to the house of P.W.1 and in their house I spoke with Praveena.  I have
to pass in front of the house of P.W.1 to reach my tailoring shop from my house.
It is true I stated in my 161 Cr.P.C. statement that on 04.06.1998 while I was
passing Surendra Reddy's house I saw Praveena and accosted her".  

When she met the deceased in a public street, it is highly unbelievable that the
deceased would explain her woes in marital life at that place.  Therefore, a
serious doubt lingers in the mind of the Court on the veracity of the P.W.3 and
this doubt should go to the benefit of the accused.  The trial Court rejected
the evidence of P.W.4 by giving cogent and convincing reasons.  The evidence
left over is that of P.W.5 and P.W.6.  P.W.5 states that the appellant/A-1
abused the deceased in filthy language on 07.06.1998 i.e. the day of
'Srimantham'.  Neither P.W.1 nor any inmates of the house of P.W.1 speak of the
appellant/A-1 hurling abuses against the deceased.  P.W.6 did not support the
prosecution and prosecution declared her hostile.  There is no convincing
evidence to show that the deceased was subjected to harassment soon before her 
death.  Once the prosecution failed to prove harassment soon before her death,
the appellant/A-1 is entitled to acquittal for the offence under Section 304-B
I.P.C.

18.In the result, this criminal appeal is allowed setting aside the
conviction and sentence of the appellant/A-1 for the offence under Section 304-B
I.P.C. and he is acquitted of the same.  The bail bonds furnished by him shall
stand cancelled.

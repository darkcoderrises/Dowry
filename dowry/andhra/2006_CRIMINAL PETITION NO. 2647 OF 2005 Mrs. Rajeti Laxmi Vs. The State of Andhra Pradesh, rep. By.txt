CRIMINAL PETITION NO. 2647 OF 2005     

12-07-2006 

Mrs. Rajeti Laxmi

The State of Andhra Pradesh, rep. By
Public Prosecutor & another

Counsel for the Petitioner: Mr.E.V.Bhagiratha Rao

Counsel for the Respondent No.1: Public Prosecutor
Counsel for the Respondent No.2: Mr.A.Ravi Shanker 

:ORDER:  

This Criminal Petition is filed by the petitioner-A-6 under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
to quash the proceedings for the offence punishable under Section 498-A read
with 34 IPC in C.C.No.233 of 2004 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of
First Class, Cheepurupalli, which was originally registered for the offence
under Sections 498-A, 497 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act read
with 34 of IPC.
        It is the case of the petitioner-A6 that she is only concubine of A-1 and
having illicit intimacy with him. Even, if the allegations made in the charge-
sheet are taken as true and correct, she cannot be punished for the offence
under Section 498-A IPC. Under Section 498-A I.P.C., who ever relative of the
husband of the victim subjects the victim to cruelty, shall be punishable.  It
is stated that the action of A-1 having illicit intimacy with A-6, amounts to
cruelty to LW.1, who is the wife of A-1, but it cannot be said that she is the
relative of A-1, to attract the provisions of Section 498-A IPC.
        The learned Public Prosecutor submits that whether the petitioner-A-6 is
relative or not, is a matter to be enquired before the trial court and it is not
for this court to appreciate the evidence.
        The entire reading of the charge-sheet and the statements of LWs.1 to 7,
goes to show that it is nobody's case of the accused or the prosecution that A-6
is the relative of husband of L.W.1. She is only concubine of A-1 and having
illicit intimacy with him.  Therefore, in the absence of any averment in the
charge-sheet or any statement that she is a relative of A1, I am of the opinion
that the offence under Section 498-A IPC do not attract to A-6.  Even as per the
dictionary meaning "relative" means 'a person connected by blood or marriage or
a species related to another by common origin'.  Simply because A-6 is having
illicit intimacy with A-1, it cannot be said that she is a relative of A-1.
Accordingly, the Criminal Petition is allowed quashing the proceedings in
C.C.No.233 of 2004 for the offence under Section 498-A I.P.C. against the
petitioner-A6. Insofar as the other offences are concerned, it may go on.

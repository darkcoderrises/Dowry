Crl.R.C.No.15 of 2014

Date:   15.04.2014


ORDER:  
        The revision is laid by the husband of the first
respondent challenging the judgment in Criminal Appeal
No.151 of 2013 on the file of the Additional Metropolitan
Sessions Jude, Cyberabad.  The first respondent, who
shall be referred to hereinafter as the wife, filed Domestic
Violence Case (DVC) No.4 of 2009 before the Judicial
Magistrate of First Class, Special Mobile Court-cum-XI
Metropolitan Magistrate, Cyberabad against the
petitioner herein (the husband, for short) and the parents
of the husband.  The wife laid the case under Section 12
of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 
2005 (DV Act, for short) read with Rule 6 (1) of the Rules
seeking for a protection order and compensation.
The trial Judge partly allowed the DVC No.4 of 2009.
The husband and the father of the husband, who is the
second respondent herein, were directed to pay Rs.8
lakhs to the first respondent herein (wife) along with
interest at 12% per annum from 11.05.2007.
Compensation at Rs.5 lakhs was awarded, which is  
payable by the husband within two months from the date
of the order.
        2.      The husband preferred Criminal Appeal
No.151 of 2013 before the Additional Metropolitan
Sessions Judge, Cyberabad questioning the orders in
DVC No.4 of 2009.  The parents of the husband in their
turn filed Criminal Appeal No.143 of 2013.  A common
judgment was pronounced by the learned Additional 
Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Cyberabad dismissing both 
the criminal appeals.  The orders in DVC No.4 of 2009
stood confirmed.  Aggrieved by the same, the husband 
preferred the present revision.  Be it noted that the
parents of the husband did not prefer any revision.

     3. The marriage between the main parties was 
solemnized on 27.08.2005.  On the date of marriage
itself, the wife had to leave for United States of America
(USA) where she was working and the visa and Green  
Card regulations required her presence in USA.
The husband subsequently joined the wife at USA. 
The wife and husband had serious differences and failed
to see eye-to-eye with each other.  The wife complained
that the husband was harassing her demanding  
additional dowry to a tune of Rs.25 lakhs to Rs.30 lakhs.
It is also alleged that the wife was physically harassed by
the husband in USA such as keeping her inside the 
house and bolting the door from outside.  The wife
claimed that she reported the matter to the Department
of Public Safety in West Virginia University.  The father of
the wife also lodged a complaint in Saroornagar Police
Station, Hyderabad, India on behalf of his daughter,
which was registered as Crime No.1098 of 2006. 
        
     4. It is the case of the wife that the wife had no
alternative but to seek for divorce.  The wife filed a
petition on 08.07.2006 in the Family Court, Monongalia
County West Virginia University and obtained orders for
divorce on 12.03.2007.  Inter alia, the wife contends that
she reserved her right to claim maintenance and
distribution of assets.  It is also the claim of the wife that
the father of the husband later entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU, for short) with the 
father of the wife on 11.05.2007 agreeing to pay Rs.8
lakhs, in case the wife consents for divorce and that the
amount of Rs.8 lakhs was already deposited before the
mediators.  The wife complained that the husband and
the father of the husband failed to honour their
commitment in terms of MoU.  Other allegations were 
also made which are not germane for the purpose of the
present case.
        
     5. The husband denied all the allegations of the
wife including demanding for additional dowry at Rs.30
lakhs and receipt of Rs.5,25,000/- from the wife and his
in-laws.  The parents of the husband contended that the
father of the wife forced the father of the husband to
enter into an MoU, albeit the wife had already obtained
divorce even by the date of MoU.  They claimed that they
never made any demands for dowry and contended that  
MoU is unenforceable. 
        
     6. The wife examined herself as PW.1 and 
examined her mother as PW.2.  She also examined one of   
her cousins as PW.3.  As against the evidence, the
husband examined himself as RW.1.  The father of the
husband was examined as RW.2.  After considering the  
case, the learned trial Judge ordered the husband to pay
compensation of Rs.5 lakhs to the wife and also to pay
Rs.20,000/-  as legal expenses.  It further directed the
husband and the father of the husband to pay Rs.8 lakhs
covered by MoU to the wife together with interest.
        
     7. As already pointed out, questioning the same,
the husband filed an appeal, whereas the parents of the
husband filed another appeal.  However, both the appeals
were dismissed on 06.11.2013. 
        8.      Sri P. Krishna Reddy is said to be the father of
the wife.  He is an advocate.  He laid vakalat on behalf of
the wife and conducted the case on behalf of his
daughter who is the wife herein.
        
     9. Sri Vedula Venkataramana, learned senior 
counsel for the petitioner-husband pointed out that
Ex.P.8-MoU was entered into between RW.2 and the   
learned counsel for the wife (as the father of the wife) on
11.05.2007.  The MoU contemplates that the husband  
should pay Rs.8 lakhs to the wife in the event the wife
obtained divorce.  However, Ex.P.4 copy of the decree of
divorce shows that the wife obtained divorce on
12.03.2007 itself, whereas the MoU under Ex.P.8 was 
after the divorce.  One of the terms of MoU is that the
wife should obtain divorce as a condition precedent for
payment of Rs.8 lakhs by RW.2.  

     10.        The learned senior counsel inter alia submitted
that once the matrimonial relationship between the wife
and the husband was cut off through divorce, DVC case
would not be maintainable.  He also contended that there
was no domestic relationship between the wife and the
husband at any point of time in India, so much so,
DV Act, which is applicable to the Indian territories only,
is not applicable to the controversy in the present case.
He also submitted that the husband and his parents did
not commit any domestic violence and that as there was
no domestic violence, the wife was not entitled to receive
Rs.8 lakhs.  Finally, the learned senior counsel for the
husband submitted that DV Act did not provide for any
compensation, since the very objective of the Act was to
sustain domestic relationship.
        
     11.        In Inderjit Singh Grewal v. State of Punjab ,
the wife sought for compensation u/s.12 of DV Act.
The wife sought for the custody of minor son, right of
residence and restoration of domestic articles.
The marriage stood dissolved by the date of the petition.
The Supreme Court considered that Section 12 of DV Act 
would not apply unless the decree for divorce was set
aside.  In Vijay Verma v. State NCT of Delhi , a learned
single Judge of Delhi High Court observed:
6.      Domestic relationship continues so     
long as the parties live under the same roof and enjoy
living together in a shared household.  Only a
compelled or temporarily going out by aggrieved
person shall fall in phrase at any point of time, say,
wife has gone to her parents house or to a relative or
some other female member has gone to live with her
some relative, and, all her articles and belongings
remain within the same household and she has not 
left the household permanently, the domestic
relationship continues. ..         
        
On the basis of these two decisions, it is urged by the
learned counsel for the husband that the very claim is
not maintainable.
        
     12.        Sri P. Krishna Reddy, learned counsel for the
wife placed reliance upon A. Ashok Vardhan Reddy v. 
Smt. P. Savitha .  When the wife herein filed C.C.No.48 of
2008 on the file of the II Metropolitan Magistrate,
Cyberabad at L.B. Nagar against the husband and the 
parents of the husband, a petition was filed by the
husband and his parents seeking for quashment of 
C.C.No.48 of 2008.  After an elaborate judgment, the
Criminal Petition was dismissed. As the case was
between the same parties, the learned counsel for the
wife is placing heavy reliance upon this decision.
He pointed out that the Court concluded that the
divorced wife is entitled to maintenance under the
provisions of DV Act so long as she did not contact
another marriage.  It was noted that the existence of any
jural relationship of man and his wife between the
petitioner-husband and the respondent-wife is not a sine
qua non for maintaining a domestic violence case.
Referring to grant of divorce by a Foreign Court, the
Court observed that the cases under the provisions of DV
Act would still operate if allegations are made out or
otherwise proved.
        
     13.        The learned senior counsel for the husband
contended that the allegations made by PWs.1 to 3 are
bald, sweeping and general.  He contended that there
was no incidence of physical or mental cruelty.
        
     14.        Where divorce was already granted by a
Foreign Court and where this revision is not for grant of
maintenance as such, I consider that the Court need not
go into the question of the merits of this revision.
The trial Court and the appellate Court held that the
domestic violence is made out.  I go by the assumption
that the DV Act has been made out.  What should be the 
relief in such an event is the only question.
        
     15.        So far as granting of Rs.5 lakhs as
compensation is concerned, there is no counter attack
from the husband.  Similarly, the award of Rs.20,000/-
towards legal expenses is also not attacked by the
husband. This revision deserves to be dismissed
straightaway so far as legal expenses and so far as
compensation are concerned.  
        
     16.        Regarding the amount covered by MoU, the
question is whether the wife can seek for an order to
direct the husband to abide by terms of the MoU.
The MoU was executed by the father of the husband as 
well as by the father of the wife.  Neither the wife nor her
husband is a party to the MoU.  MoU between the parties
with an understanding that the husband should pay
some money to the wife and the wife should accept for
divorce, I am afraid, is against the public policy.
However, the MoU reads as if the husband agreed to pay 
Rs.8 lakhs to the wife towards the amount paid by the
wife to the husband and the amounts spent by the wife
towards the husband after their marriage.  Such an MoU
is sought to be implemented and was ordered to be
implemented by the trial Court and confirmed by the
appellate Court.  The wife or the father of the wife is a
party to the MoU perhaps would be entitled to file a suit
seeking for specific performance of the MoU.  I do not
consider that the wife can seek for enforcement of MoU
merely on the ground that the MoU was executed. 
        
     17.        Ex.P.8-MoU recites that Rs.8 lakhs constitutes
money paid to the husband by the wife.  Regarding the
question whether such money can be paid to the wife or
not, the learned senior counsel for the wife submitted
that the wife cannot seek for recovery of money through
DV Act.  However, Section 20 of DV Act is wide enough to
engulf payment of money covered by the MoU.  

        18.     The learned counsel for the wife tried to show
that various provisions of DV Act empower the wife to
seek the reliefs.  So far as compensation of Rs.5 lakhs is
concerned, the wife certainly is entitled to the same.
Added to it, the learned counsel for the wife contended
that a divorced wife is entitled to seek for reliefs under
DV Act.  In Ritesh Ratilal Jain v. Sandhya, w/o. Ritesh
Jain , the Bombay High Court referred to Section 3 of DV
Act in detail and observed that where prima facie case is
made out, the petition cannot be questioned.  However,
the present petition is not for quashment, but for the
implementation of MoU under Ex.P.8. 
        
     19.        So far as MoU is concerned, ordinarily, it
should have been a civil case.  However, in view of
Section 12 read with Section 20 of DV Act, a wife can
seek for payment of the amount covered by MoU. 
The husband was not a party to the MoU.  It may be
noticed that the MoU was entered into between the father
of the husband and the father of the wife on behalf of
their respective children.  I, therefore, assume that the
MoU is unenforceable. 
        
     20.        The learned senior counsel for the husband
referred to domestic relationship within the meaning of
DV Act.  Section 2 (f) of DV Act defines domestic
relationship as a relationship between two persons who
have been living or have lived in a shared household,
inter alia, through a relationship in the nature of
marriage at any point of time.  Section 2 (f) reads:
domestic relationship means a relationship between
two persons who live or have, at any point of time,
lived together in a shared household, when they are
related by consanguinity, marriage, or through a
relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are
family members living together as a joint family.

        21.     From the very fact that the relationship
between the parties being at any point of time u/s.2 (f)
of DV Act, it would appear that the domestic relationship
need not be enforced at the time of filing of the petition.
The trial Court as well as the appellate Court are
consequently justified in entertaining the application,
albeit there was a valid divorce between the wife and the
husband, having been granted by a Foreign Court on
12.03.2007.  The contention of the learned senior
counsel for the husband that the jural relationship of
man and his wife must be in existence by the date of the
petition and by the date of the order therefore is not
justified.  I have no reason to disagree with the view of
the trial Court and the appellate Court that albeit the
jural relationship was snapped between the wife and
husband, the wife is entitled to file petition seeking for
relief under the provisions of the Act.
        
     22.        The learned senior counsel for the husband
attacked the petition on the ground of absence of
territorial jurisdiction.  Admittedly, the Act is applicable
in India and does not have extra territorial application.
It is the contention of the learned senior counsel for the
husband that the domestic relationship between the
husband and the wife was never in India and that this
petition seeking for reliefs under the provisions of DV Act
is not maintainable in India.  The wife laid DVC No.4 of
2009 on the ground of domestic violence.  Domestic
Violence has been elaborately defined in Section 3 of DV
Act.  There was no reference u/s.3 that the conduct of
the husband or other relatives would be considered to be
domestic violence within the meaning of Section 3 of the
Act subject to the condition that the alleged conduct
occurred within India only.  In the absence of specific
provision u/s.3 of the Act that the domestic violence
ought to have been committed within India,
I consider that any act of domestic violence, whether
committed within the territorial jurisdiction of India or
outside would nevertheless be a domestic violence within
the meaning of Section 3 of DV Act.
        
     23.        In the present case, the wife claimed that she
had been harassed and was subjected to domestic  
violence which was supported by her mother and cousin.
The learned counsel for the husband primarily
considered that where the domestic violence alleged did
not occur in India, the Act has no force.  I am afraid that
such a contention cannot be accepted. In the absence of
contrary evidence and in view of the finding of the trial
Court which was confirmed by the appellate Court that
the wife was subjected to domestic violence, I am afraid
that the finding cannot be interfered with in this revision,
as the finding does not appear to suffer from perversion
or any infirmity.
        
     24.        Be that as it may, the concrete question in this
revision is whether an order can be passed for payment
of Rs.8 lakhs covered by MoU.  The learned senior
counsel for the husband did not deal with the order of
payment of compensation at Rs.5 lakhs and legal 
expenses at Rs.20,000/-, but emphatically questioned
the direction of payment of Rs.8 lakhs covered by MoU.

        25.     There is no proof from the evidence of PWs.1 to
3 that they have spent Rs.8 lakhs over the husband
which is liable to be returned by the husband.  The Rs.8
lakhs referred to is only on the basis of MoU. The learned
counsel for the wife also insisted upon the payment of
Rs.8 lakhs which is covered by MoU. 
        
     26.        The MoU was executed after the wife obtained
divorce.  Clause (2) of MoU reads that the money of Rs.8
lakhs should be paid to the wife after the wife obtains
valid divorce.  Admittedly, by the date of MoU, divorce
has already been obtained.  Neither the father of the wife
nor the father of the husband can claim that they were
not aware about the wife obtaining divorce.  Even
otherwise, the agreement entered into with a condition
that a particular event may be performed in future
becomes redundant if the said event had already been
performed.  The MoU envisages that the husband should 
pay Rs.8 lakhs to the wife if the wife obtains divorce.
By the date of signing of MoU, the wife had already
obtained divorce. I, therefore, consider that the MoU was
redundant and was of no force.  Even otherwise,
I consider that an MoU that the husband should pay
some consideration to the wife on the condition that the
wife should obtain divorce from the appropriate Court is
a contract which is against public policy and cannot be
implemented.  I, therefore, do not consider that the wife
can seek for payment of Rs.8 lakhs from the husband on 
the basis of MoU.

     27.        Both the trial Court and the appellate Court
did not consider about the validity of the MoU and about
the redundancy of the MoU, as the MoU was entered into 
subsequent to grant of divorce by a competent Foreign
Court in favour of the wife.  When these factors are taken
into consideration together with the question of public
policy, I have no hesitation to hold that Ex.P.8-MoU is
unenforceable both as redundant as well as opposed to
public policy.  The wife cannot seek for enforcement of
the same.  Consequently, the order of the trial Court as
confirmed by the appellate Court directing the payment
of Rs.8 lakhs in terms of MoU dated 11.05.2007 is bad
and is liable to be set aside.  As already pointed out, the
order of granting compensation at Rs.5 lakhs and the
order of granting legal expenses at Rs.20,000/- is
perfectly justified and deserves to be confirmed.
        
     28.        Accordingly, the Criminal Revision Case is
allowed in part.  The order of the trial Court as confirmed
by the appellate Court regarding payment of
compensation at Rs.5 lakhs and legal expenses at 
Rs.20,000/- are confirmed.  The order of the trial Court
as confirmed by the appellate Court for payment of Rs.8
lakhs by the husband to the wife is set aside, as the MoU
is found to be redundant and against public policy.
Miscellaneous Petitions, if any pending in this revision
shall stand closed.

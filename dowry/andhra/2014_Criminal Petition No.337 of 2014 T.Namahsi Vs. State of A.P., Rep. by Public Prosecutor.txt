HONBLE Dr. JUSTICE K.G.SHANKAR       

Criminal Petition No.337 of 2014

Date: 30-7-2014

Order:

        Accused No.3 in C.C.No.349 of 2012 on the file of
the XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Nampally, Hyderabad seeks for his discharge.
The complaint of the 2nd respondent culminated in
a charge-sheet under Section 498-A, IPC and under 
Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (the
D.P. Act, for short).

     2. Accused No.1 in the case is the husband of the
2nd respondent.  Accused No.2 is the mother of accused 
No.1.  The petitioner, who is accused No.3, is the father
of accused No.1.  Pending the case, accused No.2 died. 

     3. On 12-3-2000, the marriage between accused
No.1 and the 2nd respondent was solemnized.  
On 15-8-2004, the 2nd respondent gave birth to a child.
Accused No.1, however, filed O.P.No.220 of 2012 on 
09-4-2012 before the Family Court, Secunderabad 
seeking for divorce.  On 15-4-2012, the 2nd respondent
received summons in O.P.No.220 of 2012.  On the very 
next day, i.e. on 16-4-2012, the 2nd respondent lodged
the complaint which was registered as First Information
Report (FIR) in this case.

     4. It is contended by Sri T.Niranjan Reddy, learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioner, that bald allegation of
demand for additional dowry was made against accused  
2 and 3 and that no specific event of demand was
alleged.  In the complaint, the 2nd respondent claimed
that accused 2 and 3 put the 2nd respondent to extreme
pressure for additional dowry.  The word used by her is
that accused 2 and 3 were eating the 2nd respondent.
The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, however,
submitted that the contention of the 2nd respondent was
primarily aimed at her husband/accused No.1 and not 
against accused 2 and 3.

     5. It would appear that accused 2 and 3 earlier
moved this Court for quashment of C.C.No.349 of 2012
through Criminal Petition No.2882 of 2013.  This Court
dismissed the petition holding that the proceedings in
C.C.No.349 of 2012 could not be interdicted so far as
accused No.2 is concerned.  It is the contention of the
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that albeit
Crl.P.No.2882 of 2013 was filed by accused 2 and 3, this
Court considered the case of accused No.2 only and not
the present petitioner.  Be it noted that Crl.P.No.2882 of
2013 was filed by accused 2 and 3 and that through
orders dated 30-4-2013, the same was dismissed. 

     6. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
placed reliance upon PREETI GUPTA v. STATE OF     
JHARKHAND .  In this case, the Supreme Court  
administered a caution to the Bar in respect of cases
under Section 498-A, IPC.  Inter alia, the Court noticed
that relatives of the husband should not be accused of
the offence under Section 498-A, IPC without factual
foundation.

     7. In Tummala Ramnarayana v. State of Andhra
Pradesh , the accused were the husband of the 
complainant and the parents and close relatives of the
husband.  They were residents of Visakhapatnam. 
All of them allegedly went to Rajahmundry and assaulted
the wife at the house of her parents.  A learned Single
Judge of this Court observed that the allegations patently
are unnatural and improbable and that the continuation
of the case against him would cause substantial injustice
and undue hardship to the accused. 
     8. In Y.Sham Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh ,
the close and distant relatives of the husband were
implicated as accused for the offences under Sections
498-A and 420 IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.  The complainant/wife
alleged that the marriage of the complainant was
solemnized with the 1st accused on misrepresentation by 
the parents and relatives of the 1st accused that the
1st accused was an Engineering Graduate and was   
working as an Engineer.  The complainant further
claimed that the husband as well as his parents and
relatives insisted for payment of additional dowry and
that they instigated the husband to harass the
complainant.  A learned Single Judge of this Court held
that the contention is patently unconvincing and that the
allegations designedly are aimed to implicate all the
accused.  This Court quashed the proceedings against 
the parents and relatives of the husband in such
background. 

     9. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
submits that the petitioner stands on the same footing as
in these cases, being the father of accused No.1/
husband of the 2nd respondent and that no case is made 
out against him.  He also reiterated that it was more
a case of counterblast to divorce petition filed by the
husband in O.P.No.220 of 2012. 

     10. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent,
however, contended that the complaint was lodged on 
15-4-2012 itself before the 2nd respondent received
summons in O.P.No.220 of 2012.  He also contended that  
there are clear allegations against accused No.3 as the
2nd respondent claimed that they beat her and tried to
kill her.  I am afraid that the FIR made allegations
against the petitioner in unequivocal terms.  Whether the
contents of the complaint are true or otherwise can be
established during trial only.  So far as the present
petition is concerned, where there are allegations against
accused No.3/petitioner, and also where it appears that
the allegations were made prior to receipt of summons by
the 2nd respondent, the allegations deserve to be gone
into at the time of trial.  I find no justification for the
petitioner/accused No.3 to seek quashment of
C.C.No.349 of 2012.  I therefore see no merits in this
petition.

     11. This criminal petition, consequently, is
dismissed.  The miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending
in this petition shall stand closed.

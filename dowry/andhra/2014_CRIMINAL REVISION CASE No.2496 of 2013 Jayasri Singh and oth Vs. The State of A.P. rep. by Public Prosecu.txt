THE HONOURABLE Dr.JUSTICE B.SIVA SANKARA RAO            
CRIMINAL REVISION CASE No.2496 of 2013      

ORDER:          
                This Criminal Revision Case is filed under Sections 397 and 401
Cr.P.C 
by the petitioners-accused 2 to 4, having been aggrieved by the order of the
learned XIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, at Hyderabad, in
Crl.M.P.No.3877 of 2013 in C.C.No.149 of 2013 (private complaint case)
dated 23.10.2013.

                2. The contention of the learned counsel for the revision
petitioners
is that the revision petitioners are the accused Nos. 2 to 4 in C.C.No.149 of
2013 and the learned Magistrate should have seen that once the police filed
the final report from the investigation by chargesheeting only A.1 out of the
4 accused shown in the FIR,  by non-chargesheeting or deleting from array
of A.2 to A.4 who are the revision petitioners herein, the remedy of the
complainant is to file a private complaint case for proceeding with as a
protest petition for so taking as a private complaint that too after,
recording sworn statement of defacto-complainant and statements of the
witnesses, if any, under Section 200 to 204 Cr.P.C. and but for that or
during trial under Section 319 Cr.P.C. as additional accused, there is no
power to the learned Magistrate and thus taking of cognizance against these
revision petitioners by the learned Magistrate on the final report of police
even not shown them by police as accused is Judge is illegal and not
sanctioned by law that too, only on the sworn affidavits filed and not by
recording as contemplated by Section 200 of Cr.P.C. Hence, to set aside the
impugned order. 

                3. Whereas, it is the contention of the learned counsel for the 2nd
respondent/defacto-complainant that the learned trial judge is right in
taking cognizance within his power under Section 190 Cr.P.C. for the case
triable before the same Court and not even a committal proceedings,
hence, to dismiss the revision.

                4. Now the points that arise for consideration are:
1. Whether the impugned order of the learned XIII Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, at Hyderabad, in Crl.M.P.No.3877 of 2013 in
C.C.No.149 of 2013 (private complaint case) dated 23.10.2013 is
unsustainable, if so, with what observations?

                2. To what result?
Point  No.1:
          5.It is important to note that, out of the 4 accused arrayed, the
police having registered the crime against them for the offences punishable
under Sections 498-A,420,406 of I.P.C. and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry
Prohibition Act, after investigation, filed the final report under Section 173
of Cr.P.C. by showing A.1 as sole accused by non-chargesheeting the other
accused 2 to 4- the revision petitioners.  It is therefrom, the learned
Magistrate has taken cognizance on the final report only against the A.1.

                6.  In fact, the Magistrate is competent to take cognizance
including
those non-chargesheeting accused if at all from perusal of the chargesheet
and investigation material relied on by the prosecution as the Magistrate is
not bound by the referred report of the police. It is no doubt the
complainant got a right of hearing before the Magistrate while considering
the police report in so far as against the accused of FIR not chargesheeted
to record so or even against the cahrgesheeted not to take cognizance as
held by the Apex Court in Ajay Kumar Parmer Vs. State of Rajasthan  at
para-20.  It is as laid down in Motilal Songara vs. Prem Prakash @ Pappu
that Magistrate is not bound to accept final report filed by the Investigating
Officer and he can take cognizance and issue process against the person
though exonerated by the investigating agency.  It is for the Court to accept
or reject the final report in part or toto after considering the material
before it.  Victim of the offence has right to get justice as accused.

              7. However, instead of so doing if at all there is a material, the
learned Magistrate has taken cognizance only against the chargesheeted 
sole accused-A.1 by directing to issue process for his appearance and not
mentioned anything so far as non-chargesheeted accused 2 to 4 of the First
Information Report.

              8. As such, once that stage is exhausted, only remedy to the
defacto-
complainant is to file protest petition even in the form of private complaint
such protect petition the Magistrate can take as a private complaint as in
case of a privte complaint filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C. for the offences
under the Sections which are triable as a warrant case by adopting warrant
cases procedure, after recording the sworn statement of the complaint and
the statements of witnesses present or on summoning, if any, vide Rosy Vs.
State of Kerala

       9. However, there are no sworn statements recorded as contemplated
by Section 200 of Cr.P.C. but relied relied on the sworn affidavits filed by
the complainant and other witnesses. It is not like a specific provision under
Section 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, with non-obstante clause
notwithstanding anything contained in the Cr.P.C. to accept the affidavit in
evidence or by virtue of the expressions under the N.I.Act extending the
filing of affidavit to accept as sworn statement of pre-cognizance stage vide
decisions in Indian Bank Association Vs. Union of India  and  Gulam Hider
Ali Khan Vs. Managing Partner, Shirdi Sai Finance

       10. Having regard to the above, the taking of cognizance on the sworn
statements of the defacto-complainant and other witnesses of the
complainant instead of recording the sworn statements by the Magistrate is
since not sanctioned by law, the order is liable to be set aside.  There is no
need to go into the scope of Section 319 of Cr.P.C. as it is not the stage,
where trial is commenced against the sole accused and from said evidence
it is showing complicity of other accused.

                11. In the result, Revision is allowed by setting aside the impugned
dismissal order of the learned Magistrate in Crl.M.P.No.3877 of 2013, dated
23.10.2013.  The learned Magistrate is required by this order to subserve
the ends of justice to record afresh the sworn statements of the defacto
complainant and other witness present or on being summoned them for said 
purpose and then to decide on own merits for taking cognizance against A.2
to A.4 or not. Consequently, miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in this
revision, shall stand closed.

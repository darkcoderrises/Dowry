HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE S. RAVI KUMAR          


CRIMINAL PETITION NO.  2000 OF 2012     


The court made the following    :       [order follows]

O R D E R  :


             This Criminal Petition is filed to quash F.I.R. in Crime No. 17 of
2012 
on the file of Narayanpet Police Station, Mahbubnagar district.
        2.  Heard advocate for petitioners and learned Public Prosecutor.
        3. Advocate for petitioners submitted that second respondent herein
earlier gave a complaint with the same allegations which was registered as
Crime No. 38 of 2004 and the husband moved this court to quash the
proceedings in Criminal Petition No. 592 of 2007 and the other accused
against whom charge sheet is filed also moved this court to quash
proceedings in CC and both the Criminal Petitions are allowed and
proceedings are quashed. It is submitted that husband gave talaq to the
second respondent herein wayback in 2007 and thereafter husband never 
lived with second respondent herein i.e., complainant therefore allegation
that petitioners have demanded dowry on 27/11/2011 is a patent lie and it is
only created for the purpose of complaint. He further submitted that this
complaint is nothing but abuse of process of law particularly section 498-A
IPC and deserves to be quashed. 
        4.  I have perused the material papers filed alongwith this criminal
petition. Even from the allegations in the complaint, it is clear that a crime
was registered by Narayanpet Police in Crime No. 38 of 2004 on the
complaint given by second respondent herein. According to the allegations
in the complaint, proceedings against A-2 to A-5 were closed and the case
against A-1 in respect of Crime No. 38 of 2004 is pending.  As seen from the
orders in Criminal Petition No. 592 of 2007, this court by order dated
22/03/2007 quashed the proceedings in Crime No. 38 of 2004 in respect of A-
4 and this court in Criminal Petition No. 1072 of 2008 by an order dated
10/02/2011 quashed CC filed against A-2, A-3 and A-5 in pursuance of Crime
No. 38 of 2004. It is clear from these two orders that earlier complaint given
by the second respondent and the allegations of dowry harassment is not
accepted in view of the fact that husband gave talaq in the year 2007 itself.
When the material on record, prima facie disclose that there was a divorce
between wife and husband there must be convincing positive material to
support allegations of demand of dowry or alleged harassment towards
additional dowry.  In the complaint, except making a bald allegation that on
27/11/2011 A-2 to A-5 i.e., petitioners 2 to 5 herein, who are parents of the
husband, brother and sister of the husband of second respondent went to
the house of complainant at Narayanpet and demanded a sum of Rs.25,000/-  
towards additional dowry, there is no specific details for the said allegations,
but the learned Magistrate without verifying correctness of the allegations
or the supporting material for the said allegations mechanically forwarded
the said complaint and police have registered the complaint as F.I.R. in Crime
No. 17 of 2000. Admittedly husband is residing at Singapore on account of his
employment. Even in the complaint the address of the husband is given as
employee in Sembawang Shipyard Private Limited, Post Box No.3,  
Singapore. When the complainant is residing separately on account of talaq,
the question of demanding additional dowry or causing harassment is a very
remote chance, therefore without any convincing material the said
allegations in the complaint cannot be accepted. Though talaq was given in
the year 2007, the complaint is silent about the said fact and a mere reading
of the complaint indicates that second respondent herein has suppressed
material facts relating to earlier complaint and quashing of that complaint
and talaq       etc. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for
petitioners when the material facts are suppressed and when there is no
material supporting the allegations of demand of additional dowry attracting
the ingredients of section 498-A IPC forwarding the complaint mechanically
to the police is not a proper exercise of judicial discretion which ultimately
resulted in making the parents and relatives of the husband to appear before
the police and criminal court. As rightly pointed by the Advocate for
petitioners this case squarely falls within seven points that are formulated by
the Honble Supreme Court in STATE OF HARYANA V/s. BHAJAN LAL  .  One of       
the ground indicated in that decision which is applicable to the case on hand
is mentioned hereunder:
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with
malafide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted
with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused
and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge.

Here the facts clearly disclose that complaint is maliciously filed only to
harass the parents and relatives of the husband even after divorce that too
seven years after the talaq.
        5. For the above reasons, I am of the view that this is a fit case to
exercise the powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash F.I.R. in Crime No.17
of 2012 on the file of Narayanpet Police Station.
6. Criminal Petition is allowed accordingly.

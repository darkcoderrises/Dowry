                               O R D E R
Criminal revisions under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973
                         Passed on 10th March 2011

1.    Since  both  the  above two revisions have  been  filed
  against  the common order dated 3-7-2010 passed by the  9th
  Additional  Sessions Judge (FTC), Raipur in Sessions  Trial
  No.68/2010, for quashing of the charges framed against  the
  applicants under Sections 304B &amp; 498A of the IPC, they  are
  being disposed of by this common order.

2.   As per case of the prosecution, Smt. Kiran Mishra (since
  deceased)  - wife of Rakesh Gautam i.e. applicant  No.1  in
  Criminal Revision No.408/2010, was married to Rakesh Gautam  
  in  the  year  2000 in accordance with her  custom.   Gouna
  ceremony was performed in the year 2002.  Applicant  Rakesh
  Gautam and other applicants i.e. relatives of Rakesh Gautam -
  husband  of Kiran Gautam, committed torture &amp; cruelty  upon
  Kiran Gautam in connection with demand of dowry and finally
  Kiran Gautam died on 31-12-2008 in her matrimonial house in
  abnormal  circumstances.  Report  was  lodged,  matter  was
  investigated and finally, charge sheet has been filed against
  the applicants.  After hearing the parties, the trial Court
  has  framed  charge under Sections 304B &amp; 498A of  the  IPC
  against all the applicants i.e. husband of the deceased and
  relatives of husband of the deceased.

3.    I  have  heard learned counsel for the parties, perused
  both the criminal revisions, copy of charge sheet and reply
  filed on behalf of the State/non-applicant.

4.    Learned counsel for the applicants submits that as  per
  case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam (since deceased)  was
  married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 and she
  committed suicide or she died in abnormal circumstances on 31-
  12-2008  after  more than seven years of her marriage  and,
  therefore, the trial Court was not competent to frame charge
  under Section 304B of the IPC.  Penal provisions are required
  to be applied strictly and the Court was under obligation to
  frame  charge in accordance with the provisions of  Section
  304B of the IPC.  In order to frame charge under Section 304B
  of the IPC, the prosecution is required to show prima facie
  material that there was valid marriage, the bride  died  in
  abnormal  circumstances as a result of  suicide  or  bodily
  injury or burns within seven years of her marriage and  she
  has been subjected to cruelty or torture in connection with
  demand of dowry soon before her death.  In the present case,
  as per case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam died in abnormal
  circumstances after more than seven years of her marriage.

5.    Learned  counsel for the applicants placed reliance  in
  the  matter  of  Public Prosecutor,  High  Court  of  A.P.,
  Hyderabad v. Tota Basava Punnaiah and others1 in which  the
  High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held that Section 304B  of
  the  IPC  is a special provision which is inserted  by  the
  amendment  in 1986 to deal with dowry deaths.   It  applies
  where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily
  injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances,
  if the other conditions i.e. demand of dowry soon before her
  death  and  death within seven years of her  marriage,  are
  satisfied.  Learned counsel further placed reliance in  the
  matter of Baljeet Singh and another v. State of Haryana2 in
  which  the  Supreme Court has held that the prosecution  is
  required to establish that the bride died within seven years
  of her marriage.  Learned counsel also placed reliance in the
  matter of Chhagan v. State of Madhya Pradesh3 in which  the
  High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that in case of death
  of  wife  after more than seven years of her  marriage,  no
  presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence  Act,
  1872  (for  short  `the Act') would be available.   Learned
  counsel relied upon the matter of Satyabhan Patel v. State of
  M.P.4 in which the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that
  for the purpose of presumption under Section 113A of the Act,
  the  date of marriage is the material date and not date  of
  Gouna ceremony.  

6.    On  the other hand, learned State counsel opposes  both
  the revisions and submits that definitely, the prosecution is
  required  to collect sufficient material to show  that  the
  bride  died within seven years of her marriage in  abnormal
  circumstances and to satisfy the other ingredients  of  the
  offence  of  dowry  death.  Learned State  counsel  further
  submits that the word `marriage' should not be construed in
technical  or limited sense, `marriage' is the sacred  union,
  legally permissible, of two healthy bodies of opposite sexes.
  In the present case, parties are Hindus and for completion of
  marriage or solemnization of marriage, parties are required
  to observe the custom prevailing in their caste or society.
  Learned State counsel also submits that Gouna ceremony is a 
  part  of  marriage and marriage only completes after  Gouna
  ceremony and prior to Gouna ceremony there was no occasion of 
  meeting of bride with bridegroom and, therefore, the crucial
  date for reckoning seven years of marriage in case of social
  group in which Gouna ceremony is prevalent, is the date  of
  Gouna and not the date of technical marriage.

7.     As  per  the  material  collected  on  behalf  of  the
  prosecution,  available in the charge  sheet,  bride  Kiran
  Gautam  was married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the  year 
  2000 and her Gouna ceremony was performed in the year 2002.  
  If  Gouna ceremony is considered as completion of marriage,
  charge framed by the trial Court is sustainable under the law
  and if Gouna ceremony is not considered as essential part of
  marriage, presumption under Section 113A of the Act would not
  be available and charge framed against the applicants under
  Section 304B of the IPC would not be sustainable under  the
  law.

8.    Both  the  parties are Hindus, governed  by  the  Hindu
  Marriage  Act, 1955.  Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage  Act,
  1955  provides  conditions  for solemnization  of  marriage
  between Hindus which reads as follows: -
          "5.   Conditions  for  a  Hindu   marriage.-A
          marriage  may be solemnized between  any  two
          Hindus,  if  the  following  conditions   are
          fulfilled, namely:-

          (i)  neither party has a spouse living at the time of the
            marriage;

          (ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party-
            (a)  is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in
               consequence of unsoundness of mind; or

            (b)  though capable of giving a valid consent, has been
               suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an
               extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of
               children; or

            (c)  has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity;

          (iii)     the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one
            years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of
            the marriage;

          (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited
            relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of
            them permits of a marriage between the two;

          (v)  the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the
            custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage
            between the two;"

9.    As  per  Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act,  1955,  a
  Hindu  marriage  may be solemnized in accordance  with  the
  customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto and if
  such rites and ceremonies include the saptapadi (that is, the
  taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly
  before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete  and
  binding  when the seventh step is taken.  A Hindu  marriage
  under  the  Act must be solemnized in accordance  with  the
  customary rites and ceremonies of at least one of  the  two
  parties thereto.

10.   Marriage solemnized contrary to clauses (i), (iv) &amp; (v)
  of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is void marriage
  in  accordance  with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage  Act,
  1955.   Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides
  the  marriages which are voidable.  Section 12 of the Hindu
  Marriage Act, 1955 reads as follows: -
          "12.  Voidable  marriages.-(1)  Any  marriage
          solemnized,  whether  before  or  after   the
          commencement of this Act, shall  be  voidable
          and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on
          any of the following grounds, namely:--

          (a)  that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the
            impotence of the respondent; or

          (b)  that the marriage is in contravention of the condition
            specified in clause (ii) of section 5; or

          (c)  that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent
            of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required
            under section 5 as it stood immediately before the
            commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act,
            1978 (2 to 1978), the consent of such guardian was obtained
            by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as
            to any material fact or circumstance concerning the
            respondent; or

          (d)  that the respondent was at the time of the marriage
            pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.

          (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
          section  (1),  no  petition for  annulling  a
          marriage-

          (a)  on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1)
            shall be entertained if-

            (i)  the petition is presented more than one year after the
               force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud
               had been discovered; or

            (ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived
               with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after
               the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the
               fraud had been discovered;

          (b)  on the ground specified in clause (d) of sub-section (1)
            shall be entertained unless the court is satisfied-

            (i)  that the petitioner was at the time of the marriage
               ignorant of the facts alleged;

            (ii) that proceedings have been instituted in the case of a
               marriage solemnized before the commencement of this Act
               within one year of such commencement and in the case of
               marriages solemnized after such commencement within one year
               from the date of the marriage; and

            (iii)     that marital intercourse with the consent of the
               petitioner has not taken place since the discovery by the
               petitioner of the existence of the said ground."

11.   If  the  marriage is solemnized in violation of  clause
  (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, same may
  be  repudiatable  at  the instance of  bride  who  has  not
  completed  the  age of fifteen years at  the  time  of  her
  marriage  in accordance with clause (iv) of sub-section (2)
  of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  Clause (iv)
  of sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act,
  1955 reads thus,
          "(2)  A wife may also present a petition  for
          the  dissolution of her marriage by a  decree
          of divorce on the ground,--

          (i)  ***         ***       ***
(ii) ***       ***       ***
(iii)     ***       ***       ***
          (iv) that her marriage (whether consummated or not) was
            solemnized before she attained the age of fifteen years and
            she has repudiated the marriage after attaining that age but
            before attaining the age of eighteen years.

            Explanation.-This  clause  applies  whether
          the  marriage was solemnized before or  after
          the   commencement  of  the   Marriage   Laws
          (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976)."

  In  case of marriage of bride who has not attained the  age
  of  15 years at the time of her marriage, she has right  to
  repudiate  her  marriage,  even after  consummation,  after
  attaining  that  age but before attaining  the  age  of  18
  years.

12.  Dowry death is punishable under Section 304B of the IPC.
  Section 304B of the IPC reads as follows: -
          "304B. Dowry death.-(1) Where the death of  a
          woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury
          or   occurs   otherwise  than  under   normal
          circumstances  within  seven  years  of   her
          marriage and it is shown that soon before her
          death   she  was  subjected  to  cruelty   or
          harassment by her husband or any relative  of
          her  husband for, or in connection with,  any
          demand  for dowry, such death shall be called
          "dowry  death", and such husband or  relative
          shall be deemed to have caused her death.

            Explanation.-For the purpose of  this  sub-
          section, "dowry" shall have the same  meaning
          as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,
          1961 (28 of 1961).

            (2)  Whoever commits dowry death  shall  be
          punished  with imprisonment for a term  which
          shall  not be less than seven years but which
          may extend to imprisonment for life."

13.  As per Section 113A of the Act, abetment of suicide by a
  married woman may be presumed.  Section 113A of the Act reads  
  as follows: -
          "113A.  Presumption as to abetment of suicide
          by  a  married  woman.-When the  question  is
          whether the commission of suicide by a  woman
          had  been  abetted  by  her  husband  or  any
          relative of her husband and it is shown  that
          she had committed suicide within a period  of
          seven years from the date of her marriage and
          that  her  husband or such  relative  of  her
          husband  had  subjected her to  cruelty,  the
          court  may presume, having regard to all  the
          other  circumstances of the case,  that  such
          suicide had been abetted by her husband or by
          such relative of her husband.

                Explanation.-For the  purpose  of  this
          section,   "cruelty"  shall  have  the   same
          meaning  as  in  section 498A of  the  Indian
          Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860)."

14.   Penal  provision for dowry death under Section 304B  of
  the  IPC has been inserted by the legislature by Act 43  of
  1986 with effect from 19-11-1986.  this penal provision  is
  applicable  to  all sects and groups of society.   Form  of
  marriage required to be observed, customs and completion of
  marriage  are  different in different sects and  groups  of
  societies, no uniform code would be possible for all groups.
  In Muslim law, marriage takes effect only after consummation
  of marriage.  The word `marriage' has not been defined in the
  Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.

15.   The  word  `marriage' has been defined in  Black's  Law
  Dictionary, 7th Edition, 1999, as follows: -
          "1.     The legal union of a man and woman as
            husband and wife.  Although the common  law
            regarded  marriage as a civil contract,  it
            is   more  properly  the  civil  status  or
            relationship existing between a  man and  a
            woman who agree to and do live together  as
            spouses.    The  essentials  of   a   valid
            marriage  are  (1) parties legally  capable
            of   contracting   marriage,   (2)   mutual
            consent  or  agreement, and (3)  an  actual
            contracting in the form prescribed by law.

          2.The  act  or  ceremony so uniting  them;  a
            wedding."

16.    As  per  Christian  law,  marriage  as  understood  in
  Christendom is the "voluntary union for life of one man and
  one woman, to the exclusion of all other".

17.   As  per  inquest  report and  autopsy  report,  age  of
  deceased Kiran Gautam as on 1-1-2009 was about 22 years.  In 
  the  year 2000, the alleged year of marriage, she was  aged
  about  14-15  years and in the year 2002, on  the  date  of
  alleged Gouna, her age was about 16-17 years.  On the date of
  her  alleged  marriage, the bride was not in a position  to
  satisfy condition No.(iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage
  Act, 1955, considering her age between 14 and 15 years.

18.   Marriage  was  also repudiatable and revocable  at  the
  instance of bridge till attaining the age of 18 years.

19.   Statements of the witnesses recorded under Section  161
  of  the CrPC clearly reveal that marriage took place in the
  year  2000 and Gouna ceremony took place in the year  2002,
  thereafter,  deceased Kiran Gautam went to her  matrimonial
  house.  This shows that in the year 2002, Kiran Gautam went
  to her matrimonial house for the first time for discharging
  her marital obligations and she became capable of discharging
  her marital obligations only from 2002 and not from 2000.  In
  the  present  case, Gouna is not second time or  subsequent
  vidai of the bride from her paternal house.  But the material
  collected on behalf of the prosecution, prima facie, reveals
  that  in  the  present case, Gouna is first  time  vidai  /
  departure  of  the bride from her paternal  house  for  her
  matrimonial house to discharge her marital obligations  and
  prior  to  Gouna it was not possible for her, in accordance
  with her custom, to discharge her marital obligations or to
  unite with her husband.

20.   As per the definition of marriage given in Black's  Law
  Dictionary, 7th Edition, 1999, the essentials  of  a  valid
  marriage  are  (1) parties legally capable  of  contracting
  marriage, (2) mutual consent or agreement, and (3) an actual
  contracting in the form prescribed by law; and the  act  or
  ceremony so uniting them.

21.   In  the present case, Gouna ceremony is a ceremony  for
  uniting the bride and the bridegroom as a part of marriage.
  Therefore, in the present case, it appears from the material
  collected on behalf of the prosecution that Gouna  was  the
  essential ceremony for completion of marriage and after Gouna
  the bride would be able to discharge her marital obligations
  in accordance with the custom and marriage of the bride will
  be  treated as complete only after the Gouna ceremony.  The
  bride died in abnormal circumstances within seven years  of
  her  Gouna.  In the present case, the prosecution has  also
  collected  material  to satisfy other  ingredients  of  the
  offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC.  Complete
  marriage in accordance with custom is a question of fact and
  depends upon the custom of different groups and sects of the
  society, no straight jacket formula would be possible.

22.   The alleged marriage between the parties was not lawful
  marriage till attainment of the age of 18 years by the bride.

23.   As  held in Tota Basava's case (supra), Chhagan's  case
  (supra)  and  Baljeet's case (supra),  the  prosecution  is
  required  to show prima facie material that the bride  died
  within seven years of her marriage in abnormal circumstances,
  with other ingredients of the offence.

24.   For  framing charge under Section 304B of the IPC,  the
  prosecution is required to show prima facie material that the
  deceased died within seven years of her marriage.  As held in
  Satyabhan's  case  (supra), the date  of  marriage  is  the
  material date and not date of Gouna ceremony.  But in  that
  case, Gouna ceremony and its effect have not been discussed.
  In absence of any fact relating to Gouna and the facts of the
  present  case  that  at the time of marriage,  age  of  the
  deceased was below 16 years; the bride (deceased) was  even 
  not  competent  to give consent or valid marriage  was  not
  possible  in terms of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage  Act,
  1955; only after Gouna ceremony i.e. after two years of the
  alleged marriage, she went to the house of her husband  for
  discharging  her  marital obligations; Gouna  is  essential
  ceremony of marriage in the present case; and marriage  was
  not  valid  without Gouna ceremony, the case  of  Satyabhan
  (supra)  is distinguishable on facts to that of the present
  case.

25.   In  the present case, the bride died within seven years
  of her Gouna ceremony i.e. completion of her marriage.

26.   After  considering the material collected on behalf  of
  the prosecution, by framing charge under Section 304B of the
  IPC against the applicants, considering the crucial date of
  reckoning seven years from the date of Gouna, which is  the
  essential  ceremony for completion of marriage,  the  trial
  Court has not committed any illegality.

27.   Consequently, both the revisions are devoid  of  merit,
  same  are  liable  to  be dismissed  and  they  are  hereby
  dismissed.

                                -------------------------------------------------

                                    Bail Application No.623 of 2007

                                 -------------------------------------------------

                                     DATED: FEBRUARY 5, 2007


                                                 O R D E R


         Petitioners seek anticipatory bail on the allegation that they have been arrayed


as   accused   Nos.1   to  4  in  Crime  No.489/2006   of   Harippad   Police   Station   for   offences


punishable under secs.498A and 406 read with sec.34IPC.


         2.       The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that petitioners 1


to 3 alone  are  the  surviving  accused since  the  4th  petitioner who  was originally  the  4th


accused has since been deleted from the array of accused.  The marriage between the


1st  petitioner   and   Vineetha,   the   de   facto   complainant,   took   place   only   on   12.5.2006.


Within a short span of post-marital life there has been demand for more dowry resulting


in Vineetha leaving the matrimonial home and taking refuge in her own parental house.


Such being the position, I am not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the 1st  petitioner.


In the case of petitioners 2 and 3 who are accused Nos.2 and 3 I am inclined to grant


anticipatory bail.


         3.         Accordingly,   a   direction   is   issued   to   the   officer-in-charge   of   the   police


station concerned to release petitioners 2 and 3 on bail for a period of one month  in the


event   of   their   arrest   in   connection   with   the   above   case   on   each   of   them   executing   a


bond  for   Rs.   10,000/-   (Ten   thousand   only)   with  two   solvent   sureties   each   for   the   like


amount to the satisfaction of the said officer and subject to the following conditions:-


                  1.       The   2nd  petitioner   shall   report   before   the   Investigating   Officer

                           between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Wednesdays.




                    2.       Petitioners 2 and 3 shall make  themselves available for

                              interrogation as and when  required by the  Investigating Officer.


Bail A.No.623/2007                                  -:2:-





                  3.       Petitioners   2   and   3   shall   not   influence   or   intimidate   the

                           prosecution   witnesses   nor   shall   they   attempt   to   tamper   with   the

                           evidence for the prosecution.




                  4.       Petitioners 2 and 3 shall not commit any offence while on bail.




                  5.       Petitioners   2   and   3   shall   surrender   before   the   Magistrate

                           concerned and seek regular bail in the meanwhile.





If  petitioners 2 and 3  commit breach of any of the above conditions, the bail granted to


them shall be liable to be cancelled.


         4.   There  is no reason  why    the  1st  petitioner should not   surrender  before  the


magistrate concerned  and seek regular bail.  Accordingly, if the 1st petitioner surrenders


before   the   magistrate   and   files   an   application   for   regular   bail   within   two   weeks   from


today,   the   same   shall  be   considered   and   disposed   of   preferably  on   the   same   day  on


which it is filed.


         This application is disposed of as above.





                                                                         V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE

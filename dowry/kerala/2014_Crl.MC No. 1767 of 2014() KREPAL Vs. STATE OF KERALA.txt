                 Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
               ---------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 27th March, 2014

                            O R D E R


      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and

2 in S.C. 115/2013 on the file of the Assistant Sessions

Court, Chengannur         to quash the proceedings in view

of the settlement under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

    2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners

are accused in S.C.115/2013 pending before the

Assistant Sessions Court, Chengannur.                    A case was

registered as Crime           No. 639/2012 of Chengannur

Police Station on the basis of the statement given by the

defacto complainant i.e. 2nd respondent against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 323, 324,

308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, Annexure - A final report                     was

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                2

filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Chengannur        and      the learned     Magistrate had

committed the case to the Court of Sessions and after

committal, the Sessions Court, Alppuzha          has taken

cognizance of this case          as S.C.   115/2013   and

thereafter made over to the Assistant Sessions Court,

Chengannur for disposal.

      3.        Now the petitioners       and the defacto

complainant and other injured in the case have settled

the dispute and both the de facto complainant and the

injured do not want to prosecute the case. They were

neighbours and on account of the settlement, harmony

has been restored between them. No purpose will be

served by proceeding          with the case in view of the

settlement.      Since      some of the offences  are non-

compoundable in nature, they cannot apply before the

court below for compounding the case. So they have

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                       3

no option except to approach this Court seeking the

following reliefs:

            "To quash      Annexure -a  charge sheet in Crime No.

            639/2012 of Chengannur Police Station and all further

            proceedings pursuant to S.C. 115/2013 on the file of the

            Assistant Sessions Court, Chengannur against         the

            petitioners and

            ii) Grant such other relief to the petitioners as this

            Honourable Court thinks just and proper to meet the ends

            of justice in this case".



      4. The respondents 2 and 3, who are the de facto

complainant and                other injured in the case appeared

through counsel and submitted that they have settled

the matter due to the intervention of                     mediators and

local people           and        they also filed affidavits stating

these facts and on account of the settlement                        earlier

friendship has been restored between the parties.

      5.      Counsel for the petitioners                also submitted

that in view of settlement, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well.

      6.         On the other hand, the learned Public

Prosecutor, on instructions,               as directed by this Court,

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                4

submitted that there is no other case pending against

the petitioners and they have no criminal background.

But considering the fact that         the  offence under

Section 308 of Indian Penal Code has been committed,

it is not a fit case       to quash the proceedings and

opposed the application.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given            by 2nd respondent as de facto

complainant, a case was registered as Crime No.

639/2012 of Chengannur Police Station against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 323, 324,

and 308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code

and after investigation Annexure 1 final report has

been filed and after committal it was taken on file as

S.C. 115/2013 by the Sessions Court, Alappuzha and

now pending before the Assistant Sessions          Court,

Chengannur.

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                       5

      8.    It is also an admitted fact that the matter has

been now settled between                     the       petitioners and

respondents 2 and 3, who are the two injured persons

in the case.       It is true that the offence under Section

308 of Indian Penal Code has been incorporated, it is a

grave offence. But it cannot be said                      that it is an

incident happened affecting the public at large. But it

is a private dispute that resulted in the incident and

registration of the crime.

      9. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties and their relationship has been restored on

account of the             settlement due to intervention of

mediators and important personalities in the locality.

      10.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
      be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
      criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                        6

      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
      guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
      justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
      what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
      or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
      settled   their   dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
      However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
      have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
      Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
      like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
      even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
      settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
      proceedings involving such offences.       But the criminal cases
      having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
      the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
      of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
      the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
      words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
      or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
      criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
      its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.M.C. No. 1767 of 2014-B
                                7

      11. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter

has been settled between the parties and the de facto

complainant and other injured do not want to proceed

with the       prosecution    against the  petitioners, no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case and

the possibility of conviction is remote in such

circumstances. It         cannot be said to be an incident

affecting the        public at large as well.   The earlier

relationship between the parties has been restored on

account of the settlement.

      12. So considering the circumstances, this Court

feels that this is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote

the settlement and harmony that has been restored

between the parties on account of the settlement.

                                 8

      So the application is allowed            and further

proceedings in S.C.No.115/2013 (Crime No. 639/2012

Chengannur Police Station)           of  Assistant Sessions

Court, Chengannur           as against the petitioners   is

quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this Order to the

concerned Court immediately for necessary further

action.

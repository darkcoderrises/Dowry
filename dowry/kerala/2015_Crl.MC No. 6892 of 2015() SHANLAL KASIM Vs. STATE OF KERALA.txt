                     Crl.M.C. No. 6892 of 2015
                ---------------------------------------
             Dated this the 26th day of October, 2015

                             O R D E R

     The petitioners seek orders quashing the F.I.R and further

proceedings in Crime No. 546/2015 of the Ernakulam Town South

Police Station, registered under Section498-A IPC and Section 4 of

Dowry Prohibition Act, on the complaint of one Thasni Nazeer.

Orders are sought on the ground of amicable settlement of the

whole dispute between the accused and the de facto complainant

out of court. The de facto complainant Thasni Nazeer is the 2nd

respondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. She has filed affidavit to the effect

that she has settled the whole dispute with the accused, and she

has no grievance or complaint now. Her affidavit shows that the

whole matrimonial disputes stand resolved forever.        She has

joined her husband in matrimony in terms of the settlement

arrived at out of court, and she is very happy with her husband

and the small child born in their wedlock. In such a situation, it is

appropriate that the prosecution be quashed.

Crl.M.C.. No. 6892/2015                2


         In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held

that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High

Court can quash the prosecution; be it at the crime stage or at the

trial stage or even at the appellate or revision stage; if the parties

have really settled the whole dispute, or if continuance of

prosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, I find a real case of

settlement between the parties, and I also find that continuance

of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose other

than wasting the precious time of the court, when the case

ultimately comes before the court.

         In the result, this petition is allowed. The F.I.R and further

proceedings in Crime No. 546/2015 of the Ernakulam Town South

Police Station, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.

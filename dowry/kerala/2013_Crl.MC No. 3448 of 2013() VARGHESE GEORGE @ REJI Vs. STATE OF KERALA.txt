                Crl. M.C. No. 3448 of 2013
         --------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 19th day of August, 2013


                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.946/2001 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara, now

pending as LP No.61/2003, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No. 401/2001 of Mavelikkara Police

Station for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 294(b)

and 323 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all proceedings

against the petitioner in LP No.61/2003 in CC No.946/2001

pending on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Mavelikkara, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation raised by the prosecution against

the petitioner is that at about 2.30 pm on 22.10.2001 at

Punnamuttulaha junction, the accused caught hold of the

collar of the shirt of the de facto complainant and thereby

restrained him and also hit him with hands and thereby, the

accused committed the offences punishable under Sections

Crl. M.C. No. 3448 of 2013
                                  ..2..

341, 294(b) and 323 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioner is that

the entire dispute is settled with the 2nd respondent, who had

sworn into Annexure A2 affidavit.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the 2nd respondent.        I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that, as a result of mediation, the petitioner and the 2nd respondent

settled all outstanding disputes between them. It is also submitted

that in the light of the amicable settlement of disputes, the 2nd

respondent has compounded the alleged offence committed by the

petitioner, which is the subject matter of CC No.946/2001.

Therefore, the parties have decided to approach this Court

seeking invocation of the extraordinary powers vested in this

Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings

against the petitioner in CC No.946/2001. The 2nd respondent had

sworn Annexure A2 affidavit on 08.08.2013, swearing that he has

no further complaint against the petitioner and he does not want

to prosecute him any more.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received         from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

Crl. M.C. No. 3448 of 2013
                                  ..3..

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.       I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of

the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only under Sections 341, 294(b) and 323 of IPC, which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl. M.C. No. 3448 of 2013
                                          ..4..


                          "57.   The position that emerges from the above
              discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
              Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
              in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
              from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
              offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
              plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
              exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
              power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
              abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
              quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
              exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
              dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
              case and no category can be prescribed.."

It is further held as follows:-

              "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
              dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
              purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
              commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such
              like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
              relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
              is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
              resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
              Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
              of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
              possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
              of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
              prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
              not quashing the criminal case despite        full and complete
              settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the

view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably,

it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

Crl. M.C. No. 3448 of 2013
                                  ..5..

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out

of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not

have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure

A1 and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

L.P. No.61/2003 in C.C.No. 946/2001 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara.

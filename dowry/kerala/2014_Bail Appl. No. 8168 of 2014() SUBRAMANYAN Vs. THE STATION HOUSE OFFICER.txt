          Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.  Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.653/2014 of

Pattambi    Police      Station       registered        for    the   offence

punishable under Section 498A IPC.

      3.  The allegation against the petitioner is that he

tortured and harassed his wife, who is the de facto

complainant, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      4.  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.  The crime has been registered on the basis of a

private complaint filed by the de facto complainant before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Mattanchery,

BA.8186/2014
                                 : 2 :



which was referred to the police under Section 156(3)

Cr.P.C. It seems that the investigation of this case is

practically over. The custodial interrogation of the petitioner

is not required for the continued investigation of this case.

Being a matrimonial offence and considering the present

stage of the investigation, I am of the view that this is a fit

case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioner.

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

BA.8186/2014
                                  : 3 :



     on all Wednesdays and Saturdays, commencing

     from 26.11.2014 for a period of three months or till

     the filing of the final report in this case, whichever is

     earlier.


            (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.


            (iii) The    petitioner    shall   make   himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.


            (iv)  The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

              Dated this the 8th day of February, 2011

                                O R D E R

      Petitioners are accused in Crime No.24/11 of Yeroor Police

Station for offence punishable under Section 498A read with 34

of Indian Penal Code. That case was registered on the complaint

of respondent No.3, wife of petitioner No.1 alleging that

petitioners subjected her cruelty            demanding further dowry.

Petitioners seek to quash proceeding against them on the

strength of a settlement with respondent No.3.                Annexure-B is

the affidavit sworn by respondent No.3.

      2. I have heard learned counsel for petitioners, respondent

No.3 and the learned Public Prosecutor. Learned counsel for

respondent No.3 has confirmed fact of settlement.

      3. I have gone through the affidavit, Annexure-B in which

respondent No.3 has asserted that she has settled the case and

she has no further grievance in the matter. It is also stated that

no further action is necessary in the matter. Learned counsel

submits that pursuant to the agreement, petitioner No.1 and

   Crl.MC.391/11                  2

respondent No.3 have decided to separate. In the light of the

settlement, it is not necessary to pursue investigation. Hence, I

am inclined to allow this petition.

     Resultantly, this petition is allowed and Annexure-A FIR in

Crime No.24/11 of Yeroor Police Station and all proceeding taken

pursuant thereto against petitioners are quashed.

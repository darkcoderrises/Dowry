                     B.A No.4773 of 2013
       -------------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 9th day of July, 2013


                              ORDER




     Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.983 of 2013 of

Ottapalam Police Station.          They have filed the above

application seeking pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure for short, 'the Code'.

     2. The above crime was registered on a complaint filed

by the wife of first petitioner before the Magistrate and that

being referred to police for investigation and report under

Section 156(3) of the Code. Second and third petitioners are

the parents of first petitioner, husband.

     3. Allegation imputed is that petitioners, all of them,

harassed and treated cruelly the de facto complainant

B.A No.4773/2013               2




demanding dowry. She was assaulted by petitioners while

she was at the matrimonial home and, later, also while she

was at her home living separately from her husband, is her

case. Investigation of the crime is now in progress and, at

this stage, petitioners have filed the application seeking

anticipatory bail.

     4.      Learned counsel for petitioners submits that

marriage of the spouses took place on 11.11.2012 and on

account of their incompatibility to live together the wife, de

facto complainant, is now living at her home. An application

moved by first petitioner for restitution of conjugal rights is

pending before the Family Court, is the submission of

counsel.     Allegations imputed to prosecute petitioners for

matrimonial cruelty are false, is the further submission of

counsel to urge for granting the discretionary relief applied

for.

     5. Learned Public Prosecutor has made available the

case diary for my perusal. After looking into the case diary,

particularly the complaint filed by the wife, I find, arrest and

custodial interrogation of petitioners may not be required for

a fair investigation of the crime. Petitioners can be directed

to co-operate with investigation of the crime and they can

be granted pre-arrest bail safeguarding smooth completion

of investigation.




                  First petitioner is directed to appear
              before the Investigating Officer at 10:00
              a.m    on   15.07.2013,    and,  on   such
              appearance, after his interrogation and in
              the event of his arrest in the crime, he is
              directed to be released on bail on
              executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- with one
              solvent surety.
                   In the event of arrest of second and
              third petitioners in the crime, they are
              directed to be released on bail on
              executing bond for Rs.10,000/- each, with
              one solvent surety.

                   Petitioners,  all  of   them,  shall
              co-operate with investigation and report
              before Investigating Officer as and when
              their presence is demanded, for smooth
              completion of investigation.

         Petition is allowed.

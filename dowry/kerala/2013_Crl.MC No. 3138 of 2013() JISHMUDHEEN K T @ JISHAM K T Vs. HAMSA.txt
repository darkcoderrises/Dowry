          Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
        ---------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                                ORDER

     As the parties to the above MCs. are more or less the

same and all the dispute covered by the above MCs are

settled, these MCs are heard together and being disposed of

by this common order.

     2.   Crl.M.C.No.3138 of 2013 is preferred by the accused

in Crime No.158 of 2010 of Pattambi Police Station, which is a

case instituted upon the information furnished by the de facto

complainant, who is the first respondent, wherein alleged that

accused No.6 in Crime No.154 of 2009 of Pattambi Police

Station     and      others       sustained        injuries      whereas

Crl.M.C.Nos.3139 and 3140 of 2013 are preferred by the

accused in Crime No.154 of 2009 of Pattambi Police Station in

which the first respondent is one Jishamudheen, who is the de

facto complainant therein and who is the first accused in

Crime No.158 of 2010 of the same Police Station. In Crime

No.154 of 2009 of Pattambi Police Station covered by

Crl.M.C.Nos.3139 and 3140 of 2013 the offences alleged are

Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
                              :-2-:


under Sections 143, 147, 148 & 308 read with Section 149 of

IPC. The allegation in the above crime is that, the accused

therein attacked the de facto complainant based upon the

enmity connected with the incident occurred in the previous

year. Now, the case of the petitioners in the above case is

that, the matter is settled out of court. In Crl.M.C.No.3138 of

2013, according to the petitioners/accused, the matter is

settled with the first respondent, who is the de facto

complainant and other injured. Accordingly, respondents 1 to

4 filed affidavits dated 14/07/2013 before this Court. Similarly,

in Crl.M.Appln.Nos.3139 & and 3140 of 2013 according to the

petitioners, who are the accused in Crime No.154 of 2009 of

Pattambi Police Station, the matter is settled with the de facto

complainant, who is the first respondent in the above two MCs.

who sworn into an affidavit dated 14/7/2013 and thus, the

accused as well as the aggrieved persons have no grievance

each other.

     3. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the

above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
                                    :-3-:


324 & 308 read with Section 149 of IPC which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.                  It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
                              :-5-:


to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, Crl.M.C.No.3138 of 2013 is allowed,

quashing Annexures-A1 to A3 in Crime No.158 of 2010 of

Pattambi Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.324 of 2011 on the file of the

Assistant Sessions and Subordinate Judge's Court, Ottappalam.

        Crl.M.C.No.3139     of    2013  is  allowed,   quashing

Annexures-A1 & A2 in Crime No.154 of 2009 of Pattambi

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in S.C.No.15 of 2012 on the file of the Assistant

Sessions and Subordinate Judge's Court, Ottappalam.

        Crl.M.C.No.3140     of    2013  is  allowed,   quashing

Annexures-A1 & A2 in Crime No.154 of 2009 of Pattambi

Crl.M.C.Nos.3138, 3139 & 3140 of 2013
                              :-6-:


Police Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in S.C.No.608 of 2012 on the file of the Assistant

Sessions and Subordinate Judge's Court, Ottappalam.

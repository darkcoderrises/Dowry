                      Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 28th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This Criminal Miscellaneous Petition is filed by the sole

accused in Crime No.134/2014 of Rajapuram police station to

quash the proceedings on the basis of a settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioner is the accused

in Crime No.134/2014 of Rajapuram police station, which was

registered on the basis of a statement                      given by the second

respondent/defacto complainant, who is none other than the

brother of the petitioner. There was some dispute regarding

the property and on account of the same, some incident had

happened which resulted in registration of the crime. Now the

matter has been settled between the petitioner and the defacto

complainant due to intervention of mediators and family

members and on account of the settlement, the entire dispute

has been resolved       and       harmony has been                   brought in the

family. In view of the settlement, the second respondent does

not want to prosecute his brother, who is the sole accused in

Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014               2

the case.      No purpose will be served in proceeding with the

investigation as well on account of the settlement. Since it is

in the crime stage and some of the offences alleged are non

compoundable in nature, neither the court nor the police will

drop further proceedings. So they have no other remedy except

to approach this Court seeking the following relief:

                 In the above    circumstances it is most     humbly

          prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash

          Annexure-I FIR   in  Crime No.134/2014 of       Rajapuram

          police station now pending on the file of the Judicial First

          Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg       in the interest of

          justice.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

due to       intervention of family members               and     the family

relationship between the petitioner and the second respondent

has been restored on account of the same and he does not

want to prosecute his brother as well. He filed Annexure 2

affidavit stating these facts.

      4. The counsel for the petitioner            submitted that in view

of the settlement, no purpose will be served by allowing the

investigation to continue or the trial to be conducted in the

Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014          3

case.

      5. The Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as directed by

this Court submitted that except this case there is no other

case and the investigation is in the preliminary stage and

considering the offences alleged, she opposed the application.

      6. Heard both sides.

      7. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and the

second respondent are brothers and there was some property

dispute      between them. In connection with the same, some

incident had happened and on the basis of the statement given

by the second respondent, Annexure 1 First information Report

was registered against the petitioner as Crime No.134/2014 of

Rajapuram police station alleging offences under Sections

447 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code. Now the matter has

been settled between the parties due to intervention of family

members and well wishers         of both the parties. It is also

alleged in the affidavit filed by the second respondent that on

account of the settlement,      the    relationship between the

petitioner and the second respondent has been restored and

he does not want to prosecute the case against his brother on

account of the settlement. Considering the fact that it is a

Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014                  4

family dispute which resulted in the incident and now that has

been settled between the family members, there is no possibility

of any co-operation being obtained from the family members

in the matter of conducting investigation or ultimately final

report      is filed,       they will not        support the case of the

prosecution        as well.    Further it is not        a matter of       public

interest     and being a family dispute which resulted in the

registration of the crime and since it has been settled due to

intervention of       mediators, pendency of the crime should not

be a hurdle for the settlement and for restoration of peaceful

atmosphere in the family.

      8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

       "But   the   criminal   cases   having   overwhelmingly     and   pre-

       dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes

       of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

       financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or

       the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

       family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in

       nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this

       category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014                  5

       its view, because of the compromise between the offender and

       victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

       continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression

       and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

       quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and

       compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must

       consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

       justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of

       the criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

       law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

       wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

       appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to

       the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well

       within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that it is a family dispute between the

two brothers which resulted in the incident and registration of the

crime which has been settled due to intervention of mediators and

original harmony in the family has been restored on account of the

settlement and no possibility of conviction even if investigation is

allowed to continue following the final report ultimately and it

would be only wastage of judicial time, this Court feels that this is

a fit case where power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked     to quash the proceedings in order to promote settlement

Crl.M.C.No.2474 of 2014                6

and restoration of peace and harmony in the family.

        10. So, the application is allowed. Further proceedings in

Crime No.134/2014 of Rajapuram             police station    as against the

petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this            order to the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg so as to inform the

concerned      police   station for    necessary     further   action in this

regard.

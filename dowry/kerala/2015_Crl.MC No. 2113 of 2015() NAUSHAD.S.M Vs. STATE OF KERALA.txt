               Dated this the 8th day of April, 2015

                               O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime

No.759/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 323 and 498A of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 final report in

Crime No.759/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station as against

the petitioners and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.20/2014 pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's

Court, Kasaragod, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

Crl.M.C.2113/2015
                              : 2 :



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the de facto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute    between    the  petitioners  and    the   de  facto

complainant have been amicably settled and presently, the

de facto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners and, therefore, the proceedings against the

petitioners may be quashed.

      7.     The de facto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners and,    therefore,   all   further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

Crl.M.C.2113/2015
                                : 3 :



counsel. The learned counsel for the de facto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the de facto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     Through the settlement, the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

de facto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

FIR and Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.759/2012 of

Vidyanagar Police Station as against the petitioners and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.20/2014 pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod are

hereby quashed.

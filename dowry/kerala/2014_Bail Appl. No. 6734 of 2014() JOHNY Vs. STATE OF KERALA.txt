                  ----------------------------------------
                        B.A.No. 6734 of 2014
                  ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 16th day of September, 2014

                               O R D E R

           The petitioners are accused Nos.2 to 5 in Crime No.227 of

2014 of Santhanpara Police Station, Idukki District and as they are

apprehending arrest, they preferred this application for anticipatory

bail under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C.

     2. The prosecution allegation is that the first accused in the

above crime married the daughter of the de facto complainant on

2.5.2013 and thereafter, the accused started to harass her on various

aspects including demanding more dowry. It is also the allegation of

the prosecution that connected with the phone call received by the

deceased in the above crime, she was also harassed by the accused

and thus, when the crime was registered on 29.3.2014, the only

offence alleged against the accused is Section 498A and subsequently,

by report dated 2.4.2014, Section 304B is incorporated and thereafter,

B.A.No. 6734 of 2014

                                  :-2-:

on 5.4.2014, Section 306 I.P.C. read with Section 34 is also

incorporated.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

     4. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that though the

incident has occurred on 17.3.2014, there was no allegation against

the petitioners that they have committed any offence punishable under

Section 498A or 304B of I.P.C.        Learned counsel for the petitioners

has also pointed out that when the deceased received phone call from

strangers, the same was questioned and informed the brother of the

deceased by the second accused and except the above incident, no

other incident had happened. So, according to the learned counsel for

the petitioner, even if the said incident is accepted as true, the same is

only against the second accused and other accused are no way

responsible for any of the offence alleged by the prosecution.

     5.    The learned Public Prosecutor, while opposing the bail

B.A.No. 6734 of 2014

                                 :-3-:

application, pointed out that the first accused, who is the husband of

the deceased, is in abroad and is absconding. It is also pointed out by

the learned Public Prosecutor that initially, the crime was registered

only for the offence punishable under Section 498A and thereafter, by

filing two subsequent reports, Section 304B as well as Section 306 of

I.P.C. are incorporated and as the accused are absconding, the

prosecution could not proceed with the investigation. Thus, according

to the learned Public Prosecutor, the custody of the petitioner is

absolutely necessary to complete the investigation and in case

anticipatory bail is granted to the petitioners, the same will adversely

affect the prosecution case.

      6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that though the marriage between the first accused

and the deceased was solemnised on 2.5.2013, within seven years, the

deceased committed suicide and the investigation is in progress. In

such circumstances, according to me, this Court will not be justified in

B.A.No. 6734 of 2014

                                 :-4-:

granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners. In the result, I find no

merit in this application and accordingly the same is dismissed.

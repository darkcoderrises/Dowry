                          B.A No. 7132 of 2013
                 ------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 31st day of October, 2013


                               O R D E R


      Petitioners are accused, in Crime No.1695 of 2013 of the Fort

Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram for the offence punishable under

Section 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, apprehend arrest and

has filed this application.

      2.    It is alleged that the petitioners subjected the 3rd

respondent to cruelty demanding more ornaments and dowry and

alleging that she has extra marital relationship.          According to the

petitioners, the 3rd respondent has some affair. The petitioners have

produced call details of the mobile phone.

      3.    Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor, I am inclined to think that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is not required.

      Resultantly, this application is allowed as under:


      I) In case the 3rd petitioner is arrested in Crime No.1695 of

2013 of the Fort Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram she shall be

released on bail on her executing         bond for     Rs.15,000/- (Rupees

fifteen thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each before

the arresting officer, subject to the following conditions:

B.A No. 7132 of 2013          2

         a)    The   3rd  petitioner   shall  report    to  the

        investigating officer as and when directed for

        interrogation at all reasonable time and places.

        b)     The 3rd petitioner shall not interfere with the

        investigation, intimidate or influence the witnesses.

         II)   a)    Petitioners 1 and 2 are directed to

         surrender before the officer investigating       Crime

         No.1695 of 2013 of the Fort Police Station,

         Thiruvananthapuram on 7.11.2013 at 10 am for

         interrogation.

               b)    In case interrogation of the petitioners 1

         and 2 is not completed that day, the said officer can

         direct the petitioners 1 and 2 to appear before him

         on other date/dates and time which the petitioners 1

         and 2 shall comply.

               c)    In case the petitioners 1 and 2 are

         arrested, they shall be produced before the

         jurisdictional Magistrate the same day.

               d)    On such production, learned magistrate

         shall release the petitioners 1 and 2 on bail, on their

         executing bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees fifteen

         thousand only)each with two sureties each for the

B.A No. 7132 of 2013          3

         like sum each to the satisfaction of the learned

         magistrate and subject to the following conditions:

               i)    Petitioners 1 and 2 shall report to the

         officer investigating the case and and when required

         for interrogation.

               ii)   Petitioners 1 and 2 shall not interfere

         with the investigation, intimidate or influence the

         witnesses.

               III) It is made clear that in case any of the

         above conditions is violated, it is open to the

         Investigating Officer or the defacto complainant to

         seek cancellation of the bail granted to the

         petitioners hereby, by moving application before the

         learned magistrate as held in P.K. Shaji V. State of

         Kerala (AIR 2006 Supreme Court 100).

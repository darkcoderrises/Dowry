                  .................................................
                        B.ANo.2194 of 2015
                  ..................................................
              Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015.

                                O R D E R


     This is an application for regular bail filed by the first

accused in Crime No.1369/2014 of Varapuzha police                      station

under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the

accused had committed rape of the defacto complainant, who

was married to him under the provisions of the Special Marriage

Act, against her will and also cheated her by misappropriating

huge amount and demanded more dowry and physically caused

hurt by the petitioner and other accused persons and also took

some naked photographs            and       threatened her to submit for

demands otherwise it will be published and thereby all of them

have committed the offences punishable under sections 376(2)

(b), 420, 498 A of the Indian Penal Code and section 66(E) of

the Information Technology Act.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

B.ANo.2194 of 2015              2

the petitioner has not committed any offence and he is innocent

of the same. In fact both of them were working in Kerala

Water Authority and they were in love. They were conducted

marriage under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act and

due to some difference of opinion, they fell apart and misusing

the provisions of the Act, a false case has been foisted against

him, his parents and other relatives. The other accused were

already granted anticipatory bail by this Court.     Further, the

petitioner is in custody from 12.2.2015 onwards and final report

has not been filed so far. So he prayed for allowing           the

application.

      5. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor

on the ground that investigation is not over and if he is released

on bail, he is likely to influence the witnesses and abscond.

Perused the case diary file as well.

      6. It is seen from the records that the above case was

originally registered on the basis of the statement given by the

defacto complainant as Crime No.1369/2014 against the

petitioner, his parents, sister and    sister's husband   alleging

offences under section      498 A, 376 and 420 of the Indian

B.ANo.2194 of 2015                3

Penal Code.       Later, during investigation, it was revealed that

offence under section 66(E) of the Information Technology Act

was also committed. So that section was incorporated. It is

seen from Annexure-A7 order that sessions court has granted

anticipatory bail to accused 2 to 4 as per the order in

Crl.M.C.No.1830/2014 dated 10.10.2014 and the application for

anticipatory bail    filed by the present petitioner was dismissed

as per AnnexureA7 common order. Later he was arrested and

the bail application filed by him was dismissed by Annexure-

A8 order of the sessions Court. On going through the records,

it is seen that major portion of the investigation is over and

custody of the petitioner is not required any more in connection

with the investigation. I am not going into the question

regarding the genuineness of the allegations made and whether

the allegations are sufficient to attract the offence alleged as

it is matter for the court to consider and pass appropriate

findings on facts. Investigation is not over and it is not known

as to how much time for the investigating officer to submit the

final report in this case. If the court is satisfied that custody

of the petitioner is not required any more in connection with the

B.ANo.2194 of 2015                4

investigation,     this Court can grant bail to the petitioner.

Considering the over all circumstances of the case and also the

period of pre-trial investigation and the stage of investigation,

this Court feels that bail can be granted to the petitioner with

some stringent conditions. So, the application is allowed with

the following conditions.

      i. The petitioner shall be released on bail on executing a

bond for Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties for the like sum

each to the satisfaction of the    Judicial First Magistrate Court-

III, North Paravur.

      ii. The petitioner shall appear before the investigating

officer on all Mondays and Saturdays between 9 a.m and 10

a.m for a period of two months and thereafter on the last

Saturday of every month between the         same timings till the

final report is filed.

      iii.    The petitioner shall appear before the investigating

officer for the purpose of interrogation in connection with the

above crime as and when required in writing to do so till the

final report is filed.

      iv. The petitioner shall not intimidate or influence the

B.ANo.2194 of 2015                 5

witnesses.

      v. The petitioner shall not enter the jurisdiction of

Varapuzha police station except for the purpose of complying

conditions 2 and 3 without getting prior permission from

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur till the

final report is filed

      vi. The petitioner shall surrender his passport, if any,

before the Judicial First Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur

within one week from the date of release or if he is not having

any passport, file an affidavit to that effect before that court

within that time.

      vii. The petitioner   shall not leave        Ernakulam district

without getting prior permission either from the Judicial First

Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur or from the court to which

the case will be committed for trial till the disposal of the

case.

      With the above conditions, this application is allowed.

                             B.A. No.7172 of 2015
                          --------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 3rd day of December, 2015

                                       ORDER

               Application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

       2.    Accused persons are the husband and in-laws of the defacto

complainant. They are charged with offences punishable under Sections

498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Dowry

Prohibition Act in Crime No.1284 of 2015 of Tirur Police Station. They seek

pre-arrest bail.

       3.    First petitioner married the defacto complainant on 15.01.2015.

While they were residing in the family house, the accused persons

harassed her demanding money and ornaments is the allegation.

       4.    Heard both sides.

             Considering the nature of allegations, I find no need to have a

custodial interrogation in this case. Hence the following order:

             i.    Petitioners shall surrender before the investigating

officer within a period of two weeks and submit themselves for

interrogation.   Thereafter each one of them shall execute a bond for

`25,000/- (Rupees twentyfive thousand only) with two solvent sureties each

BA No.7172/2015                         2

for the like sum to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. In that event,

they shall be released on bail in Crime No.1284 of 2015 of Tirur Police

Station.

               ii.  The sureties shall produce documents to establish their

identity and solvency. The investigating officer shall not insist on the

solvency certificate, but other documents can also be perused to find out

whether the sureties are solvent or not.

               iii. Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer

as and when directed in writing and co-operate with the investigation.

               iv.  They shall not influence or intimidate the witnesses.

               In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the officer

concerned is free to arrest the petitioners as if no order is passed.




                                               A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

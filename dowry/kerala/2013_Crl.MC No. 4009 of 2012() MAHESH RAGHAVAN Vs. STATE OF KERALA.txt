                 -------------------------------
                Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013.


                         O R D E R


       The petitioner is the first accused and accused nos.2

and 3 are the parents of the 1st accused, whereas the 4th

accused is the brother, in Crime No.20/2012 of Cyber

Crime police station, Thiruvananthapuram.          The above

crime was registered on the basis of the complaint received

in the said police station on transmitting the same under

section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. from the court of Chief Judicial

Magistrate- Thiruvananthapuram.             Thus the offences

alleged against the petitioner and other accused are under

section 498 A r/w 34 of IPC and sections 66 E, 66 D and 67

of Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008.

     2.  As per the allegation, in the above crime, the

petitioner married the de facto complainant on 9.9.2009

and thereafter she was taken to Dubai, where the

                             2
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


petitioner was working and according to the de facto

complainant, she was harassed by the accused persons

demanding more dowry and it is also alleged that her nude

photographs were kept in the laptop of the petitioner and

he threatened that the same would be published among the

public and thus the accused has committed the above

offences.

      3. That being the position, the petitioner moved an

application for bail in the trial court and by Annexure I

order, bail was granted but certain conditions were

imposed, among which one of the conditions is to surrender

the passport of the petitioner before the court below.

According to the petitioner, the police had already taken

the passport into their custody while the petitioner was

arrested at the Air Port. Since, he had to rejoin duty in the

company, where he was working in abroad, before

8.12.2012, the petitioner approached the court below and

an application was filed under section 451 of Cr.P.C.,

                               3
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


seeking for an interim custody of the mobile phone and

passport, but the court below dismissed the same as per

Annexure II order stating that the investigation was not

completed.         Against the above order, the petitioner

preferred a petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. and by

Annexure III order, this Court disposed of the same without

prejudice to the right of the petitioner to seek release of

the passport, in the application already moved before the

Sessions court. Subsequently, by Annexure IV order, the

Sessions court dismissed his petition holding that no

modification with respect to the condition imposed in the

bail orders feasible at that stage. It is against the said

order, the petitioner preferred the present petition under

section 482 of Cr.P.C. and in which the prayer is to pass an

order to set aside Annexure IV order dated 22.12.2012 of

the court of Vacation Judge, (1st Additional Sessions Judge),

Thiruvananthapuram, in Crl.M.C.No.2946 of 2012, and to

direct the court below to release the passport of the

                               4
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


petitioner on such terms and conditions to be fixed by this

Court.

      4.     Originally, the de facto complainant was not a

party in the above proceedings but as per the order dated

1.1.2013 in Crl.M.C.No.4009/13, the de facto complainant

is impleaded as additional 2nd respondent. That being the

position, the additional 2nd respondent in the above

Crl.M.C. has preferred Crl.M.A.No.4814 of 2013 under

section 482 of Cr.P.C., with a prayer to set aside Annexure

R2(b) order, which is the interim order passed by this

Court on 1.1.2013, calling upon the accused to appear

before this Court and surrender his passport before this

Court and to cancel his bail bond, and also to take

necessary steps to impound the passport of the petitioner.

      5.    I have heard both the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the additional 2nd respondent and also the

learned Public Prosecutor for the State.

                              5
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


      6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

this Court by an interim order dated 1.1.2013 in the above

Crl.M.C., has dispensed with condition numbers 1 and 3,

which contained in Annexure I order of the learned

Magistrate, that imposed while granting bail to him, for the

time being, on condition the petitioner depositing an

amount of `1 lakh before the court of Chief Judicial

Magistrate, before his leaving. It is also observed that in

view of the pendency of various disputes, it is only proper

that the parties appear before the Mediation Centre in the

High Court to try for an amicable settlement. Accordingly,

the petitioner as well as the de facto complainant were

directed to appear before the Mediation Centre on

15.2.2013 at 11 a.m. positively. According to the order, it

was made clear that if the petitioner violates any of the

conditions as directed, he will not be entitled for the

benefit of that order.       The learned counsel for the

petitioner further submitted that the petitioner has

                             6
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


complied with the above direction and he had already

deposited the cash and appeared before the Kerala

Mediation Centre. According to the counsel, due to the

adament stand of the additional 2nd respondent, the matter

could not be settled.

      7. Learned counsel appearing for the additional 2nd

respondent vehemently submitted that the petitioner has

not complied with the conditions incorporated in the order

dated 1.1.2013 of this Court and therefore the above order

of this Court has to be set aside, and after securing the

presence of the petitioner before this Court, he is to be

directed to surrender his passport and his bail bond is also

liable to be cancelled.

      8. I have carefully considered the submissions made

by the counsel for the petitioner as well as the counsel for

the additional 2nd respondent and also the learned Public

Prosecutor.

                                7
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


      9. It is pertinent to note the basic fact that the above

Crl.M.C. is filed by the petitioner, who is one of the accused

in the crime referred above, aggrieved by the conditions

imposed on him while granting bail to the petitioner. Till

the filing of the above Crl.M.C., nobody has approached

this Court by filing any proper petition against granting

him bail or for cancellation of bail or challenging the

insufficiency of bail conditions or questioning the order

releasing passport.      Additional 2nd respondent filed the

above petition in the above M.C., filed by the petitioner, for

the relief sought for in this proceedings. So, according to

me, the present petition filed by the additional 2nd

respondent is only frivolous in nature, as part of the

frequent legal fighting and dispute between the petitioner

and the additional 2nd respondent who is none other than

the wife of the petitioner.

        10. It is true that in paragraph 5 of the above order

dated 1.1.2013, this Court has observed that :

                                   8
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


                   "Various disputes are pending between the parties
            evidently. Learned counsel for the de facto complainant
            submitted that all the education certificates of the de
            facto complainant are being possessed by the petitioner
            and are yet to be returned. The petitioner will return all
            those    documents    which   are   in  his   possession
            immediately on his return back to Dubai, at any rate,
            within a period of two weeks from today and for
            enabling him to travel out, the passport will be returned
            on execution of a bond by the petitioner undertaking to
            resubmit the passport back as and when directed by the
            court below or by this Court."

But it is relevant to note that the documents which claimed

to have belong to the additional 2nd respondent and alleged

to be in the possession of the petitioner, are not identified

by this Court in the above said order. In this juncture it is

relevant to note that, the learned counsel for the petitioner

has submitted that the petitioner is not having in

possession of any documents belong to the additional 2nd

respondent. Learned counsel has also submitted that the

petitioner has already filed an affidavit dated 2.1.2013

before this Court in support of the prayer in Crl.M.C.

stating the said fact.         So, with respect to the alleged

violation of the conditions incorporated in the order dated

                              9
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


1.1.2013, there is no absolute materials or evidence before

this Court and especially when at this stage, this Court is

not in a position to ascertain that, which documents are

within the custody of the petitioner and which are ordered

to be return within the stipulated time. The additional 2nd

respondent has no case that the petitioner has violated the

condition of depositing cash of `1 lakh in the court below

and he has not appeared before the Kerala Mediation

Center as directed in the said order. In this juncture it is

relevant to note that though the petitioner appeared before

the Mediation Centre, the Nodal Oficer of High Court

Mediation Centre, by his letter dated 22.5.2013, has

forwarded the report of the Mediator, Adv.Smt.Prabha

R.Menon, by which it is reported that the matter could not

be settled amicably. Therefore, according to me, the above

petition filed by the additional 2nd respondent is devoid of

any merit and the same is liable to be dismissed.

                             10
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


      11. Moreover, as I indicated earlier, the present M.C.

is filed by the petitioner with a prayer to delete the

conditions imposed while granting bail and accordingly,

this Court by order dated 1.1.2013 modified the condition

numbers 1, 3 and 7 that contained in Annexure 1 order and

the petitioner has complied with the condition therein and

thus he had got a relief as sought for in this M.C. As I

indicated earlier, as decided by this Court in the order

dated 1.1.2013, the parties though appeared before the

Mediation Centre, there was no fruitful turnout. It is also

relevant to note that various litigations are pending

between the parties in various courts. Therefore, if the

additional 2nd respondent is sticking on her prayer for

getting custody of the documents, she can move the

appropriate court with such prayer and it is for that court

to decide such question on merit and to pass appropriate

orders on it. So, according to me, no further orders are

necessary in the above M.C. and accordingly the same can

                               11
Crl.M.C.No.4009 of 2012


be closed.

         In the result, the order dated 1.1.2013 in the above

M.C. is absolute and accordingly the above Crl.M.C. is

disposed accordingly.

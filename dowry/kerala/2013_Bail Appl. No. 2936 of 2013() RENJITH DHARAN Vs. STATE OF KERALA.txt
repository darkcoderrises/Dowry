                  B.A. No. 2936 of 2013
                -----------------------------------
           Dated this the 12th day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R


     This is a petition filed under Section 438 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.                Petitioners are the

accused in Crime No.327 of 2013 of the Ochira Police

Station registered for the offences punishable under

Sections 447, 498 A and 323 read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.

     2.  The allegation against the petitioners is that

they   have   tortured      and      harassed      the defacto

complainant who is the wife of the first petitioner and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry and

gold ornaments after misappropriating her entire gold

ornaments and money. As the defacto complainant has

not heeded to the demand of the first petitioner to

B.A. No. 2936/13
                            -:2:-

procure more money from her house, she was being

physically tortured and harassed. It is alleged that,

every day she was being severely beaten by the first

petitioner. As she could not withstand the harassment,

she voluntarily went to her house by detaching her

relationship with the first petitioner. On 03.03.2013 at

8.30 p.m., the first petitioner went to her house, called

her out and beat, fisted and stamped her repeatedly

thereby causing injuries.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

and the learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the case

diary. The contents of the case diary prima facie reveal

the complicity of the first petitioner. The wound

certificate present among the records in the case diary

clearly reveals the injuries sustained to the defacto

complainant.    Considering the seriousness of the

allegations against the first petitioner and the present

stage of the investigation, I am satisfied that he is not

B.A. No. 2936/13
                            -:3:-

entitled to the discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

At the same time, there are no other specific

allegations against the 2nd petitioner and no specific

instances have been pointed out. Matters being so, I

am satisfied that anticipatory bail can be granted to the

2nd petitioner on conditions.

     In the result, this B.A. is allowed in part and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the 2nd petitioner is directed to

enlarge the 2nd petitioner on bail in the event of her

arrest on her executing a bond for `.25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty Five Thousand only) with two solvent sureties

for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and subject to the following terms

and conditions.

     (1) The 2nd petitioner shall report before the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

all Fridays and Tuesdays, commencing from 19.07.2013

B.A. No. 2936/13
                              -:4:-

for a period of three months or till the filing of the final

report of this case whichever is earlier.

      (2) The 2nd petitioner shall not tamper with the

evidence or influence witnesses.

      (3) The 2nd petitioner shall make herself available

for interrogation     as   and when required by           the

Investigating Officer.

      (4) The 2nd petitioner shall not involve in any offence

while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

      This Bail Application, so far as it relates to the the

first petitioner, stands dismissed.

                   Crl.R.P.No.1156 of 2005
         ----------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of October, 2015

                            ORDER

     The revision      petitioner, who is the appellant in

Crl.Appeal No.149/2001 of Additional District and Sessions

Judge   (Adhoc)    Fast   Track    Court-II,    Pathanamthitta,

challenges the judgment of conviction u/s.324, 326, 354 IPC.

He was the accused in C.C.No.190/1998 of Judicial First

Class Magistrate, Ranny for offence punishable u/s./447,

324, 326 and 354 IPC, he was convicted and sentenced to

undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year u/s.324 IPC,

rigorous imprisonment for one year u/s.354 IPC, rigorous

imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of 5,000/-

u/s.326 IPC, in default of payment of fine, simple

imprisonment for three months. Against that, he preferred

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005            2

the above appeal, which was dismissed by the appellate

Court.      Being aggrieved by that, the accused preferred

this revision petition.

      2.      The prosecution allegation against the revision

petitioner is that on 1.1.1998 at 8 a.m., the accused

committed criminal trespass in the residential compound of

PW1 and voluntarily caused hurt to her by caught hold of

her hair and beat with the hands of a tapping knife on her

back and pulled her down, thereafter he intimidated her to

fear of death and pelted stone to her, as a result, she

sustained injury on her right eye and also sustained a

fracture on the bone and lost the sight of her right eye.

On the basis of information, Vechoochira Police registered

Crime No.10/98 and after completing investigation, filed a

final report in the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Ranny.

      3.      To prove the offence, the prosecution examined

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005          3

PW1 to PW9 and marked Exts.P1 to P5. The incriminating

circumstances brought out in evidence were denied by the

accused, while questioning him.    He examined DW1 and

marked Exts.D1 to D3. The trial Court, after analysing the

evidence, convicted the accused.

      4.      When the matter came up for hearing, the

learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner

submitted that they have settled the matter out of Court

and filed Crl.M.A.No.172/2008 u/s.320 and 482 Cr.P.C.

The revision petitioner submitted that at the time of

settlement, the revision petitioner gave 1 lakh to PW1.

      5.      It   is true that the   offences   are   non-

compoundable offences, but in view of the decision of the

Apex Court in Gyan Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)], High Court can invoke inherent powers

u/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceedings, including

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005                4

non-compoundable offences, when the matter is settled by

the parties. Apex Court in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT 108) held as follows:-

                   "The position that emerges from the
             above discussion can be summarised thus: the
             power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
             proceeding or F.I.R or complaint in exercise of
             its  inherent   jurisdiction  is  distinct  and
             different from the power given to a criminal
             court for compounding the offences under
             S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
             plentitude with no statutory limitation but it
             has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
             engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
             ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
             process of any Court. In what cases power to
             quash the criminal proceeding or complaint of
             F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and
             victim have settled their dispute would depend
             on the facts and circumstances of each case and
             no category can be prescribed.         However,
             before exercise of such power, the High Court
             must have due regard to the nature and gravity
             of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
             mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
             dacoity etc, cannot be fittingly quashed even
             though the victim or victim's family and the
             offender have settled the dispute.         Such
             offences are not private in nature and have
             serious impact on society.       Similarly, any
             compromise between the victim and offender in
             relation to the offences under special statutes
             like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005                5

             offences committed by public servants while
             working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for
             any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
             involving such offences. But the criminal cases
             having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
             flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
             arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
             civil, partnership or such like transactions or
             the offences arising out of matrimony relating
             to dowry, etc, or the family disputes where the
             wrong is basically private or personal in nature
             and the parties have resolved their entire
             dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
             because of the compromise between the
             offender    and   victim,  the   possibility  of
             conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
             of criminal case would put accused to great
             oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
             would be caused to him by not quashing the
             criminal   case   despite   full and   complete
             settlement and compromise with the victim. In
             other words, the High Court must consider
             whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
             interest of justice to continue with the criminal
             proceeding or continuation of the criminal
             proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
             process    of   law  despite    settlement  and
             compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
             and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
             appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
             and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
             its   jurisdiction  to   quash    the   criminal
             proceeding."

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005           6

Hence, on the basis of compromise reached between the

parties, offence u/s.447, 354 IPC are compoundable

according to the Table of 320(1) (2) Cr.P.C.      When an

offence is compounded by the parties and no further

grievance subsists, this court can permit parties to

compound the case.          The offence u/s.324 is non-

compoundable offence after Amendment by Act 5 of 2009.

S.326 IPC is also non-compoundable.

      6.      Today, both parties are present. I have gone

through Crl.M.A.No.172/2008. On enquiry she stated that

she lost the sight of one eye and the amount given by the

accused is meagre one.       I am satisfied with the facts

stated by the victim. The revision petitioner is residing at

Erumeli, who is now aged 68 years and prays to set aside

the findings of the trial Court by invoking the revisional

jurisdiction.       Both parties have settled the matter.

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005          7

However, in view of the decision in Suresh and another v.

State of Haryana [(2015) 2 SCC 227], the victim is entitled


to get compensation and rehabilitation. The object and

purpose of Section 357A Cr.P.C. is to enable the court to

direct the State to pay compensation to the victim where

the compensation under Section 357 Cr.P.C. is not adequate

or where the case ended in acquittal or discharge and the

victim is required to be rehabilitated. In view of the above

decision, I am bound to order some compensation amount

to the victim invoking inherent jurisdiction since the victim

lost her eye sight. The revision petitioner outraged her

modesty and she sustained other injuries in the assault.

      7.      After settlement and quashing the conviction,

there is no provision for giving any compensation for any

loss or injury whether physical or pecuniary. Money will

not compensate the loss of eye sight and her reputation.

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005            8

In Mary Angel v. State of Tamil Nadu [1999 SCC (Cri) IL 96

Apex Court held that 482 Cr.P.C. could be invoked to award

cost. Accepting the above guidelines of the Apex Court,

while invoking inherent powers u/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash the

criminal proceedings, this Court has power to make such

orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order

under this Code. Compensation can be awarded by this

Court while compounding the offence invoking S.482 Cr.P.C.

      8.      In   the circumstances,   the  conviction and

sentence       for   offence  u/s.324   and   326    IPC in

C.C.No.190/1998 are quashed by invoking S.482 Cr.P.C.,

according to the following conditions:

      1)      The revision petitioner is directed to appear

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Ranny on

7.12.2015 and shall pay additional 2,00,000/- (Rupees

two lakh only) as compensation u/s.482 Cr.P.C. for the loss

Crl.R.P. No.1156/2005          9

of sight, outraging modesty and fracture sustained. If the

amount is deposited, it shall be disbursed to the victim.

      (2) If this amount is not paid within the stipulated

time, the revision petitioner has to undergo the sentence

passed by the trial Court and the order u/s.482 Cr.P.C. will

be treated as cancelled.

      Post on 15.12.2015 for reporting compliance.

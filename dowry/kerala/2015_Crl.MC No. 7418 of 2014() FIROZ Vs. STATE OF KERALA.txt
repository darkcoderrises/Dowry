                   Crl.M.C. No.7418 of 2014
            =======================
           Dated this the 2nd day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.601 of 2009 of the

Malappuram Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Sections 406, 323 and 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

           2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in

Crime No.601 of 2009 of the Malappuram Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.318 of 2010 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Malappuram,

quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A read with Section 34 IPC, by

demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

Crl.M.C. No.7418 of 2014
                                 2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints     against   the petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd     respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

Crl.M.C. No.7418 of 2014
                                  3

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.601 of 2009 of the Malappuram Police

Station    and     all  further proceedings     based   on  it,   in

C.C.No.318/2010 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Malappuram, are hereby quashed.

                                       ORDER

              Petition under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

       2.     Petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.1179 of 2015 of

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition

Act. First petitioner is the husband of the defacto complainant and other

petitioners are the parents of the first petitioner. It is alleged that after

marriage between the defacto complainant and the first petitioner on

18.07.2015 the petitioners harassed her for money and dowry.

       3.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       4.     Considering the nature of allegations, I am of the view that

custodial interrogation is not necessary in this matter. In the result, the

petition is allowed with the following directions:

              i.    Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer

within a period of two weeks and submit themselves for interrogation.

Thereafter each one of them shall execute a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees

twentyfive thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to

BA No.5381/2015                         2

the satisfaction of the investigating officer. In that event, they shall be

released on bail in Crime No.1179 of 2015 of Kadavanthra Police Station.

               ii.   Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer

as and when directed for the purpose of investigation in the matter.

               iii.  They shall not influence or intimidate the witnesses.

               In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the learned

Magistrate having jurisdiction is empowered to cancel the bail in

accordance with law without referring the matter to this Court.




                                               A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

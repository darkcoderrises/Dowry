                        Crl.M.C. No. 89 of 2015
             ..............................................................
                   Dated this the 11th day of March, 2015.


                             O R D E R




      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.581/2014 of the

Koyilandy Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report in Crime

No No.581/2014 of the Koyilandy Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C No.874/2014, pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Koyilandy, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the accused, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

Crl.M.C No.89 of 2015           2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.   The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.             She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.   When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

Crl.M.C No.89 of 2015            3

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

     In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed and Annexure-A Final

Report in Crime No No.581/2014 of the Koyilandy Police Station

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C No.874/2014,

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Koyilandy, are hereby quashed.

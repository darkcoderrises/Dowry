                  B.A.No.6621 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
     Dated this the 17th day of September, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The petitioners, who are accused nos.2 to 5 in Crime

No.842/14 of Manjeri Police Station, preferred this

application for anticipatory bail under section 438 of

Cr.P.C. as they are apprehending arrest.

     2. The prosecution allegation is that the 1st accused in

the above crime married the de facto complainant on

3.5.2014 and while the de facto complainant was residing

in her matrimonial home, the accused harassed her

demanding more dowry and finally they forcefully aborted

the fetus conceived by the de facto complainant and thus

according to the prosecution, the accused 5 in numbers

committed the offence punishable under sections 498A,

313 r/w 34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

B.A.No.6621 of 2014
                              2

the learned counsel for the additional 3rd respondent, who

is impleaded in this bail application vide separate order. I

have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently

submitted that the 1st accused, who is the husband of the

de facto complainant, gone abroad within the 26th day of his

marriage and the factum that the de facto complainant

conceived was confirmed only on 10.6.2014, before which

the 1st accused left abroad. It is also the submission of the

learned counsel for the petitioners that, on the basis of the

consultation with a physician on 13.6.2014, the de facto

complainant was volunteered to go to her parental home on

26.6.2014 and Annexure-A2 complaint was filed only on

9.8.2014 before the Circle Inspector of Manjeri Police

Station which was forwarded to the Sub Inspector of

Manjeri Police Station.     So, according to the learned

counsel, the complaint itself was filed, 2 months after the

de facto complainant left from her matrimonial home. It is

also pointed out by the learned counsel that even in

B.A.No.6621 of 2014
                              3

Annexure-A2 complaint, no specific overtact is alleged

against the petitioners. The learned counsel appearing for

the additional 3rd respondent submitted that when the de

facto complainant was residing in matrimonial home, all

the accused harassed her demanding more dowry, stating

that the 1st accused could have obtained more beautiful

bride etc. It is also the submission of the learned counsel

that the 1st accused along with other accused, forced the de

facto complainant to abort the fetus and thus, essential

ingredients under sections 318 and 498A of IPC are

attracted against the petitioners. While resisting the bail

application, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

the allegations raised against the petitioners are serious

and they forcibly administered the tablets on the de facto

complainant to abort the pregnancy. So, according to the

learned Public Prosecutor, the custodial interrogation of

the petitioners is absolutely necessary.

      5.      I have carefully considered the arguments

advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

B.A.No.6621 of 2014
                                4

learned      counsel   appearing    for   the  additional   3rd

respondent.        I have also gone through the materials

produced along with this bail application.

      6.    I have carefully perused Annexure-A2 complaint,

which was filed by the de facto complainant-who is an

advocate by profession. As rightly pointed out by the

learned counsel for the petitioners, the 1st accused-husband

of the de facto complainant left much before 10.6.2014, the

date on which the pregnancy of the de facto complainant

was confirmed. However, in Annexure-A2 complaint dated

9.8.2014, ie., it is specifically stated that on 19.6.2014, the

mother of the husband, his second sister and his father had

forcibly administered three tablets on the de facto

complainant, inspite of her objection and as a result of

which, on 20.6.2014 at about 11 a.m., there was profound

bleeding and pain and thereafter she was collapsed. It is

true, the de facto complainant is an advocate, but the said

fact is not sufficient to disbelieve her version about the

forcible administration of tablets upon her who was

B.A.No.6621 of 2014
                              5

pregnant at that time.     Thus, clear overtact is alleged

against the petitioners.

      7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, this Court will not be justified in

granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

      In the result, I find no merit in this petition and

accordingly the same is dismissed.

            ---------------------------------------
               Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014
           ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 24th day of June, 2014

                            ORDER



           This is an application filed by accused Nos.1 to 3 in

S.C. No. 404 of 2013 pending before the Court of Assistant

Sessions Judge, Kochi, to quash the proceedings on the basis

of settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

           2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No. 1583 of 2012 of

Mattancherry Police Station, which was registered on the basis

of a statement given by the de facto complainant, second

respondent, alleging that they have committed offences

punishable under Sections 323, 324, 341 and 308 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final

report was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Kochi, and it was taken on file as C.P. No. 12 of 2013

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014             2


and thereafter, it was committed to the Court of Sessions,

where it was taken on file as S.C. No. 404 of 2013 and

thereafter it was made over to Court of Assistant Sessions

Judge, Kochi, and it was now pending before that Court.

              3. Due to the intervention of well wishers of both

sides, the matter has been now settled between the parties and

the de facto complainant and other injured do not want to

prosecute the petitioners. In view of the settlement, there is no

possibility of conviction.          Since the offences are non

compoundable in nature, they could not file an application for

compounding before the concerned Court. So they have no

other option except to approach this Court seeking the

following relief.

        "To quash Annexure I Final Report and all further
        proceedings pursuant thereto, in the light of Annexures
        2 to 4, so as to secure the ends of justice."

              4.   Respondents 2 to 5, who are the de facto

complainant and other injured in the case appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of well wishers of

both parties and on account of the settlement, their old

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014          3


relationship has been restored and harmony has been brought

among the people of locality and they do not want to prosecute

the petitioners in view of the settlement. They also stated that

they have filed separate affidavits stating these facts.

              5.  Learned  counsel   for   the  petitioners also

submitted that in view of the settlement, no possibility of

conviction and keeping the case on file will only amount to

wastage of Judicial time.      So he prayed for allowing the

application.

              6.  Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court submitted that though there were some

petty cases against the petitioners, they ended in conviction by

payment of fine alone and except this case there is no other

case now pending against the petitioners, but opposed the

application on the ground that Section 308 of the Indian Penal

Code has been incorporated.

              7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant, Mattancherry Police has registered a case as

Crime No. 1583 of 2012 against the petitioners alleging

offences under Sections 323, 324, 341 and 308 read with

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014           4


Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It is also an admitted fact

that after investigation, final report was filed and it is now

pending as S.C. No. 404 of 2013 before Assistant Sessions

Court, Kochi. Now, the matter has been settled between the

parties which is evident from the affidavits filed by respondents

2 to 5. It is stated in the affidavits that due to the intervention

of well wishers of both parties, the matter has been settled and

they have no grievance against the petitioners and they have no

objection in quashing the proceedings as harmony has been

brought between them on account of settlement. Considering

the fact that the matter has been settled between the parties,

there is no possibility of conviction as well, even if the case is

allowed to prosecute as neither the de facto complainant nor

the witnesses and other injured persons, will support the case

of the prosecution and it will only amount to wastage of Judicial

time. Though Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code has been

incorporated, I am not going to the question at this stage as to

whether the allegations are sufficient to attract that offences or

not in view of the fact that the matter has been settled between

the parties. Further, it is settled law that if a crime has been

committed on account of some misunderstanding between the

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014              5


neighbouring members and due to the intervention of

mediators and well wishers, the disputes have been settled,

then Court must honour such settlement and for keeping the

harmony among them the pendency of the case should not be

a hurdle.

              8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:




             "The   position  that   emerges   from    the  above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High

      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or

      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

      and different from the power given to a criminal court for

      compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

      limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

      guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

      any Court.    In what cases power to quash the criminal

      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where

      the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of

      such power, the High Court must have due regard to the

      nature and gravity of the crime.      Heinous and serious

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014              6



      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have

      serious impact on society.      Similarly, any compromise

      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or

      the offences committed by public servants while working in

      that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the

      criminal   cases     having   overwhelmingly       and   pre-

      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,      partnership or

      such like transactions or the offences arising out of

      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes

      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this

      category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

      between the offender and victim, the possibility of

      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

      case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

      and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

      settlement and compromise with the victim.           In other

      words, the High Court must consider whether it would be

      unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

      the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

      despite settlement and compromise between the victim

      and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,

      it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if

      the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the

      High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2014            7



      criminal proceeding."

              9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and no purpose will be served by

keeping the case on file as conviction of such cases will be

remote, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the settlement

and harmony that has been resulted between the parties and

the pendency of this case could not be a hurdle for the same.

              So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

S.C. No. 404/2013 pending before the Assistant Sessions

Court, Kochi, (Crime No. 1583 of 2012 of Mattancherry Police

Station) as against the petitioners is quashed.           Office is

directed to communicate this order with the concerned Court

immediately for necessary further action in this regard.

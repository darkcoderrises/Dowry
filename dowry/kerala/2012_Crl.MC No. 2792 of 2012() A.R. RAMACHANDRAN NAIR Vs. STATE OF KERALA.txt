         Dated this the 28th day of September, 2012


                                 ORDER



     Petitioners are the accused in a pending case numbered as

C.C No.756 of 2010 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Ernakulam. They are being prosecuted for the offence

punishable under Section 498(A) r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police, Hill Palace

Police Station, Kochi. Crime in the aforesaid case was registered

on complaint of matrimonial cruelty and harassment by the in

laws and the close relatives of the husband, demanding dowry.

Several other proceedings also were pending before other forums

between the de facto complainant and her in laws and such cases

have been settled after mediation, is the submission of the

counsel for the petitioners, which is endorsed by the counsel

appearing for the third respondent/de facto complainant as well.

An affidavit has been also sworn to by the de facto complainant

asserting the aforesaid statement made by her counsel and also

Crl.M.C No.2792/2012              2




stating that in view of the settlement effected she is not any more

interested in prosecuting the petitioners.      Since the offence

imputed against the petitioners could be treated as personal

arising out of the disputes between the close relatives over one

or other problems connected with the matrimonial relationship of

the third respondent with her husband, and not affecting the

public at large, I find, in view of the settlement effected,

continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioners is

not necessary, more so not advisable. The apex court has held in

"Gian Singh Vs State of Punjab" (2012(4) KLT 108(SC))

that in cases of this nature invoking of Section 482 of the Code

for quashing the criminal proceedings will be justified even if the

offences imputed against the petitioners do not come under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.             Criminal

proceedings against the petitioners in C.C No.756 of 2012 on the

file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam

are quashed under Section 482 of the Code.

      Petition allowed.

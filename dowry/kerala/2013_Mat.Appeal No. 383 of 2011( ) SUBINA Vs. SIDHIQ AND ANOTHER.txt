           ----------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                             JUDGMENT

ANTONY DOMINIC,J.

     This appeal arises from the judgment and decree of the Family

Court, Nedumangad in O.P.No.60/2009.        The O.P. was filed by the

appellant herein for return of Rs.4 lakhs, 25 sovereigns of gold

ornaments and a rado watch worth Rs.10,000/- from the 1st

respondent.

     2.    The marriage between the appellant and the 1st respondent

was solemnized on 3.8.2008. According to the appellant, at the time

of marriage, the 1st respondent was given cash Rs.4 lakh as 'acharam'

and a rado watch worth Rs.10,000/-.

     3.    It is the case of the appellant that she was given 25

sovereigns of gold ornaments. It is stated that since the beginning of

her matrimonial life, the respondents treated her with cruelty of

various kinds and that in the meanwhile, apart from misappropriating

the cash and the rado watch, the 1st respondent also threatened and

extracted from the appellant 25 sovereigns of gold ornaments and

misappropriated it. Finally, the appellant had to leave the matrimonial

Mat. Appeal No.383/11                2

home on 4.9.2008 and accordingly she joined her parents with

whom she is now living. It was in these circumstances that the

appellant filed O.P.No.60/2009 before the Family Court for return of

gold, cash and the rado watch. She produced Exts.A1 to A5 and

also filed her proof affidavit substantiating her averments.

      4.     Admittedly, the respondents entered appearance before

the Family Court and thereafter, they remained absent and were

declared exparte and an exparte decree as prayed for by the

appellant was passed.      Subsequently, on an application filed by

them, the exparte decree was set aside and the respondents were

given an opportunity to contest the matter on merits. However,

again the respondents absented from the Court, as a result of

which, they were declared exparte. Thereafter, the Family Court

considered the case of the appellant and dismissed the claim

holding that, all that was available before the Family Court was the

unsubstantiated claim of the appellant. The Court also doubted the

conduct of the respondents in remaining exparte. It is aggrieved by

this judgment of the Family Court, the appeal has been filed by the

appellant wife.

      5.     We are also informed by the learned counsel for the

appellant that, subsequently, the appellant filed O.P.No.892/2011

Mat. Appeal No.383/11                3

before the Family Court, Nedumangad for divorce and that there

also an exparte decree of divorce was passed by the Family Court

on 1.6.2012. That decree also has become final.

       6.    We heard the learned counsel for the appellant and also

the learned counsel for the respondents.

       7.    According to the learned counsel for the appellant, in the

light of the fact that the appellant had tendered her evidence by

filing a proof affidavit and has also produced Exts.A1 to A5, as she

was not cross examined by the respondents, her claim should have

been accepted by the Family Court.

       8.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for the

respondents contended that there was no legally acceptable

evidence regarding the entrustment of the amount, gold or watch to

the 1st respondent and that therefore, the Family Court was justified

in dismissing the petition.

       9.    Having considered the rival submissions made at the

bar, we are of the view that the Family Court clearly erred in

dismissing the petition. It is the specific case of the appellant that

at the time of marriage, the 1st respondent was given 'acharam' of

Rs.1 lakh and Rs.3 lakh as dowry, apart from a rado watch worth

Rs.10,000/-. She also contended that she was given 25 sovereigns

Mat. Appeal No.383/11              4

of gold ornaments at the time of her marriage. In support of her

case, she had produced Ext.A1 application made by both parties and

their parents with their signatures to the Town Muslim Jama Ath,

Kochukarikkakam dated 25.7.2008. This documents mentions that

at the time of marriage, the 1st respondent was given 'acharam' of

Rs.1lakh, Rs.3 lakhs as dowry and the appellant was given 25

sovereigns     of   gold  ornaments.       The    entrustment    and

misappropriation have been narrated in the proof affidavit filed by

the appellant and in the proof affidavit, she has also stated that by

threatening her, the 1st respondent had extracted her 25 sovereigns

of gold ornaments. As already stated, the respondents remained

absent as a result of which, the appellant was not cross examined.

This, therefore, means that there was unchallenged evidence

adduced by the appellant to substantiate her case. In such a case,

we see no reason why the Family Court should not have accepted

the evidence adduced by the appellant.         If her evidence was

accepted, there was no reason to decline her prayer for a decree as

prayed for by her. Therefore, we are not inclined to agree with the

view taken by the Family Court and accordingly, we set aside the

decree passed by the Family Court dismissing O.P.No.60/2009.

      10.    The O.P. will stand decreed entitling the appellant to

Mat. Appeal No.383/11                5

realise Rs.1 lakh paid as 'acharam', Rs.3 lakhs as dowry and

Rs.10,000/- towards value of the rado watch.          She will also be

entitled to 7% interest from the date of petition till date of

realisation. She will also be entitled to realise 25 sovereigns of gold

ornaments from the respondents and on failure thereof, she will be

entitled to realise the value thereof at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per

sovereign. If the amount is not paid within six weeks from today,

the appellant will also be entitled to realise interest at the rate of

7% from today till date of realisation.

      The Mat. Appeal is disposed of as above.

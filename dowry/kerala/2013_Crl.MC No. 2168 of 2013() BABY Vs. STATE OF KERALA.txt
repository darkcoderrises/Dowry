                Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013
                -------------------------------
         Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013.


                        O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance  of   the  petitioners,     who     are accused   in

C.C.No562/12 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Parur, which is a case instituted upon the police report [in

Crime No. 234/12 of Binanipuram Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 326 r/w 34 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I charge in the

above calendar case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that, on

25.3.2012 at 6.45 p.m., due to enmity towards the de facto

complainant and others, the 1st accused had wrongfully

detained the de facto complainant and the 2nd accused had

dropped a granite piece on the left foot and thereby caused

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013


fracture of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th metatarsal bones of the left

foot and on pelting a small stone, had caused injury on

the right side of the head of the 3rd respondent and it is

also alleged that the accused acted with common

intention and with an intention to cause bodily harm.

Now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court, as evident from Annexures 5 and 6

affidavits filed by respondent nos.2 and 3 respectively.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the 2nd respondent/de facto complainant and 3rd

respondent/injured. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/de

facto complainant and 3rd respondent/injured, who on the

                               3
Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013


basis    of   specific  instruction received    from   the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who

are the de facto complainant and the       injured do not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

they have no grievance against the petitioners.

         6.      I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341,

326 r/w 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

                                   4
Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013


amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears

to me that the de facto complainant and the injured have

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in

the light of the settlement arrived by them.                 In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of
         its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised     in accord    with    the   guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any Court. In what cases power to
         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or
         F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend
         on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having

                                 5
Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013


         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising       from   commercial,      financial,
         mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
         disputes where the wrong is basically private
         or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category
         of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim,
         the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would
         put accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to him
         by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with
         the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved  in   the   present     case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

                               6
Crl.M.C.No.2168 of 2013


prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - 1 charge and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No562/12 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Parur, in Crime No.       of

234/12 of Binanipuram Police Station.

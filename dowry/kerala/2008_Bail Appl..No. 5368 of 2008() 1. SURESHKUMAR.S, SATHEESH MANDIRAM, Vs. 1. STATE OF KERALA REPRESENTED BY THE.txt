                     B.A.No. 5368 of 2008

            Dated this the 29th October, 2008

                            O R D E R

      This petition is for anticipatory bail.

      2. The alleged offence is under Sections 498(A) read with

34 of the Indian Penal Code. According to prosecution, first

accused married de facto complainant and after the marriage,

first accused, his parents and his mother's sister, who are

accused 2 to 4, allegedly harassed the de facto complainant by

demanding more money and dowry. The allegations is that

gold ornaments and money given at the time of marriage were

misappropriated.

      3. Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that     de

facto complainant filed a petition as O.P.No.485/2008 before

the Family Court, Kottarakkara for return of gold ornaments

and money. She is not willing to come and reside with the

husband and hence, he is moving for a divorce. The matter is

being mediated into and the case is posted for counseling to

7.11.2008. In the meantime, if petitioner is arrested and

detained in custody, it will cause irreparable injury and loss

   BA.5368/08                   2

and the chances for settlement will have fizzled out, it is

submitted. It is also stated that there are no allegations

against accused 2 to 4, except vague and general allegations.

     4. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that specific

allegations are made against first accused. He was allegedly

harassing de facto complainant demanding more money.

     5. On hearing both sides, I find that anticipatory bail can

be granted on conditions. Hence, the following order is passed:

               Petitioners shall surrender before the

       Magistrate Court concerned within seven days

       from today and they shall be released on bail on

       their executing bond for Rs.25,000/- each with two

       solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

       satisfaction of the learned Magistrate, on the

       following conditions:

             i)  Petitioners  shall  report   before   the

                  investigating officer within seven days

                  from the date of their release and co-

                  operate with the investigation.

             ii)  Petitioners  shall  report   before  the

                  investigating  officer  as   and   when

                  directed.

  BA.5368/08                    3

            iii) Petitioners shall not commit any offence

                  while on bail or influence or intimidate

                  any witness.

            iv) First petitioner shall produce a fixed

                  deposit receipt in the name of de facto

                  complainant     for   an     amount     of

                  Rs.50,000/- within seven days from the

                  date of this order before the Magistrate

                  Court concerned. This condition is

                  applicable only to the first petitioner.

    Petition is allowed.

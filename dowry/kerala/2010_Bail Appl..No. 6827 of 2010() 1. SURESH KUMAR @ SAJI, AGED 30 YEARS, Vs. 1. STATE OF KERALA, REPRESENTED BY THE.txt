                     ..................................
             Bail Application No. 6827 of 2010
            .....................................................
             Dated: 27th day of October, 2010

                                 ORDER

     Petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime No.769/2010 of

Thenmala Police Station for an offence punishable under Section

306 IPC, seeks his enlargement on bail.             The occurrence took

place on 04.10.2010. The petitioner was arrested on 19.10.2010.

     2. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application

contending inter-alia that the petitioner, who was masquerading

as a true lover of the 26 year old Rejani and who was carrying on

with her, later backed out from his promise to marry her and

demanded dowry. The jilted lover put an end to her life by setting

herself ablaze.

     3.     Having regard to the gravity of the offences, nature of

the allegations levelled against the petitioner, the relative

conduct of the parties, the extent of the injury sustained, the

propensities of the petitioner, the sentiments of the near relatives

of the victim and the other facts and circumstances of the case, I

am of the view that if the petitioner is released on bail, he will

definitely influence and intimidate the prosecution              witnesses.

                                    2


There is also the likelihood of       the petitioner making himself

scarce and fleeing from justice. I am, therefore, not inclined to

grant bail to the petitioner at this stage.



       This petition is accordingly dismissed.

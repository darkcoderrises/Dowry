                     V.K.MOHANAN, J.
            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. No. 2799 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 9th day of July, 2013

                            ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in C.C.No.343/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kannur which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 639/2012 of

Kannur Town Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 420 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A FIR

and B Final Report in Crime No.639/12 of Kannur Town Police

Station and the proceedings in C.C.No.2343/2012 on the file

of Court of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur, as

the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that the first

respondent who is the defacto complainant cheated on

23/1/2011 after receiving Rs.75,000/- by the petitioner

accused proposing that he will construct and hand over three

country boat for digging sand within months for a total sum of

Rs.1,20,000/- but he withdraw from the promise. Accordingly

it is alleged that petitioner cheated the 1st respondent. And

thus the petitioner has committed the offence punishable

Crl.M.C. No. 2799 of 2013
                                2

under Section 420 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court. The first respondent,

defacto complainant is sworn into Annexure-2 affidavit.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.             Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against her.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

Crl.M.C. No. 2799 of 2013
                                     3

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Section 420 of IPC, which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me that the

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:         the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

Crl.M.C. No. 2799 of 2013
                                      4

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........   But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite           full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

Crl.M.C. No. 2799 of 2013
                                5

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures-A & B and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in C.C.No.2343/2012 on the file of Court of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur,and all further

proceedings thereto.

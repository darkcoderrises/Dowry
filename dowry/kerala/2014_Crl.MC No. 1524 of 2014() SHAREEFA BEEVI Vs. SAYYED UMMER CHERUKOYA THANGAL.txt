    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1524 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 12th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 4 in

C.C.No.245/13     pending   before    the Judicial  First   Class

Magistrate Court, Malappuram, to quash the proceedings in

view of the settlement arrived at between the parties under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C.No.245/13 on the file of the Judicial

First  Class   Magistrate   Court,   Malappuram,    which    was

originated on the basis of Crime No.460/09 of Malappuram

Police Station registered on the basis of the statement given

by the first respondent alleging offences under Sections. 465,

468, 471, 406, 420, 120(B) read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code.     The first petitioner and first respondent are

husband and wife. The property having an extent of 34.37

cents comprised in Re-Survey No.22/7,6,8 of Kuruva Amsom

Desom belong to first respondent as per sale deed No.2769/08

of Makkara Parambu Sub Registrar Office registered on

13.09.2006. When the first respondent was employed abroad

Crl.M.C.No.1524 of 2014       :  2 :

from 07.09.2006 to 04.05.2009, according to the prosecution,

the petitioners created forged document and committed breach

of trust and created a forged sale deed on 19.02.2007 as

document No.755/01/2007 transferring the same in favour of

first petitioner who is the first wife of the first respondent.

Now, the matter has been settled between the parties. In view

of the settlement, no purpose will be served by allowing the

prosecution to continue. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature, they cannot file an application for

compounding before the concerned magistrate court. So, they

have no other option but to approach this court seeking the

following relief:

           "To quash Annexure A First Information Report and

     Annexure    B   final report   and   further    proceedings in

     C.C.No.245/2013 on the file of Court of Judicial 1st Class

     Magistrate, Malappuram in the interests of justice."



      3.     First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and he has no

objection in allowing the application.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that there is no other case

except this case against the petitioners and there is no criminal

Crl.M.C.No.1524 of 2014      :  3 :

background but opposed the application for quashing.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

complaint given by first respondent, the Malappuram police

has registered Annexure A case as Crime No.460/2009 against

the petitioners alleging offences under Sections.465, 468, 471,

406, 420, 120(b) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code

and after investigation, Annexure B final report was filed

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram,

and it was taken on file as C.C.No.245/13 and it is pending

before that court. In the meantime, parties have settled the

dispute and the first respondent had executed a fresh

assignment deed in favour of the first petitioner ratifying the

earlier assignment alleged to have been fabricated by the

petitioners and the first respondent has filed an affidavit to

that effect. Since it is a case of pure civil dispute in respect of

the property which has been settled between the parties on

account of the intervention of family members and it is also a

dispute between husband and wife and their relatives.          No

purpose will be served by allowing the prosecution to continue

in view of the settlement.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

Crl.M.C.No.1524 of 2014          :   4 :


            "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
    be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
    criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
    inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
    given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
    S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
    statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
    guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
    justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
    what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
    or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
    settled   their   dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
    circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
    However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
    have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
    Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
    like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
    even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
    settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
    have serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
    offences committed by public servants while working in that
    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
    proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
    having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
    on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
    the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
    partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
    of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
    where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
    the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
    of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
    view, because of the compromise between the offender and
    victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
    continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
    oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
    caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
    complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
    words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
    or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
    and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
    whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
    criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
    question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
    its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.M.C.No.1524 of 2014     :  5 :

         7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the dispute involves

a property transaction and the matter has been settled

between the parties amicably due to the intervention of family

members and there is no possibility of any conviction being

entered, if the trial is allowed to continue in view of the

settlement, this court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the settlement

entered into between the parties which resulted in restoration

of harmony in the family.

       So, the application is allowed.      Further proceedings in

C.C.No.245/13 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Malappuram, (Crime No.460/09 of Malappuram Police

Station) as against the petitioners is quashed.           Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court for

necessary further action.

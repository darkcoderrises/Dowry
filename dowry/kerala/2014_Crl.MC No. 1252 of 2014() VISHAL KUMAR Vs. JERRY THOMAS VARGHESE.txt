    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014
    ==============================
       Dated this, the 14th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1 and 2 in

C.C.No.382/10 (Crime No.778/10 of Aranmula Police Station)

now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

No-I, Pathanamthitta, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

the settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are the

accused persons in Crime No.778/10 of Aranmula Police

Station which was registered on the basis of the statement

given by first respondent as de facto complainant alleging

offences under Sections.323, 324 and 341 read with Section

34 of Indian Penal Code and after investigation, Annexure A

final report has been filed which was taken on file as

C.C.No.382/10 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-I, Pathanamthitta.      There were several incidents

occurred while they were students in the campus and this is

one such incident. Now, the matter has been settled between

the students involved in the case. No purpose will be served

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014         :  2 :

by proceeding with the case in view of the settlement. Since

some of the offences alleged are non-compoundable in nature,

they could not file application for compounding before the

court below. So, they have no other option except to approach

this court seeking the following relief.

            "To allow this criminal miscellaneous case and quash

      Annexure A final report in Crime No.778/2010 of Aranmula

      Police Station and proceedings pursuant to the same, now

      pending as C.C.No.382/2010 on the file of the Judicial First

      Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta, so as to secure

      the interest of justice."

      3.     First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the incident happened at the time when they

were     students      of     Mount    Zion    Engineering       College,

Kadammanitta and now the difference of opinion between

them have been settled and now they have become friends

and he does not want to proceed against the petitioners and

he has no objection in quashing the proceedings and the first

respondent has filed Annexure B affidavit state these facts.

The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that though

there were three cases against the first petitioner, one of such

case    was     quashed       by  this   court    as   per    order    in

Crl.M.C.No.5077/13 and only another case is pending in which

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014     :  3 :

the de facto complainant is not available. So, he could not

settle that case as well.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,

submitted that the petitioners have involved in several crimes

and one more crime namely Crime No.341/12 of Aranmula

Police Station is still pending and so he opposed the

application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioners and first

respondent were students of Mount Zion Engineering College,

Kadammanitta, at the time when the alleged incident

happened. It is also an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by first respondent Crime No.778/10 of

Aranmula Police Station was registered and after investigation,

Annexure A final report was field and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.382/10 and now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-I, Pathanamthitta. It is also in a way

admitted by the Counsel for the petitioners and the first

respondent that, apart from this case, there were two other

cases registered against the petitioners and others in respect

of some incident happened in the college campus and one such

case namely Crime No.175/12 of Aranmula Police Station

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014       : 4 :

which later taken on file as C.C.No.825/12 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-I, Pathanamthitta was

settled     and     that  was    quashed    as   per   order    in

Crl.M.C.No.5077/13 dated 4.11.2013 by this court and they

have produced the copy of the order of that judgment for

perusal of this court as well. It is also in a way admitted that

another case as Crime No.341/12 of same Police Station is

pending against the first petitioner alone which was also a case

where the incident occurred while he was a student of the

same college.

      6.     It is quite unfortunate that student community now

a days are involving in criminal activities at the instigation of

political bosses without knowing the consequences of their act

that it is likely to affect their future.       It is also quite

unfortunate that       student community now a days who are

involving such activities are not understanding the pain that is

being taken by the parents for providing them good eduction.

They are going to college, involve in such activities on the

anticipation that they will become political bosses of tomorrow.

But, unfortunately, they are not reaching their goal as well.

But, only involved in criminal offences which affect their future.

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014        :   5 :

But, considering the fact that these incidents happened on

account of some political motivation that has been created in

the young minds without knowing the consequences and now

they have completed the course and realized their fault of

involving in such crimes on the protects of some political

motivation and they want to reform themselves and settle

there in life and the pendency of these cases should not be a

hurdle for their future, only on that the humanitarian ground,

the courts will have to take a lenient view in such cases and

pardon them for the act committed by them during their

student days without knowing the consequences that they are

now facing.

      7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
      the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
      wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard
      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014           :  6 :

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society.         Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or
      the offences committed by public servants while working in
      that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the
      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,       partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is
      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal   proceeding    or    continuation  of  the  criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law
      despite settlement and compromise between the victim and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer
      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."



      8.      In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and these incidents have happened

at the time when they were students and now they realize and

they feel that pendency of these cases is likely to affect their

Crl.M.C.No.1252 of 2014     :  7 :

future and no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties

and the student relationship and friendship between the

students have been restored on account of the settlement, this

court feels that it s a fit case the power under Seton 482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote the harmony that has been restored

between the student community and to protect their interest of

getting settled in their life by getting good employment, for

which, this should not be a hurdle.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.382/10 (Crime No.778/10 of Aranmula Police Station)

is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court for further necessary action.

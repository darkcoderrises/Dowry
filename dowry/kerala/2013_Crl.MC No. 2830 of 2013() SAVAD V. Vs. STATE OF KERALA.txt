                      V.K.MOHANAN, J.
            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. No. 2830 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                           ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in C.C.No.201/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri which is a case

instituted upon the police report for the offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 326, 427 r/w Section 149

of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 FIR and

Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.825/2008 of Manjeri

Police    Station,    Malappuram       District   pending    as

C.C.No.201/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Manjeri, as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that towards

the animosity with the defacto complainant, the accused on

19/10/2008 at 3.30 p.m., formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly with deadly weapons at Kuthukallu in Manjeri to

commit rioting and accused blocked the Motor Bike bearing

registration No. KL 11 9594 riden by the dafacto complainant,

wrongfully restrained him and caused voluntarily grievous hurt

by beating with iron rod on his head and hand. It is further

Crl.M.C. No. 2830 of 2013
                                2

alleged that accused also committed mischief by destroying

the Motor Bike. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the

disputes between the petitioner and the defacto complainant is

settled out of court and they enter into an agreement settling

the matter. Second respondent, defacto complainant has

sworn into Annexure-A4 affidavit.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent.     I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

Crl.M.C. No. 2830 of 2013
                                3

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 326,

427 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

Crl.M.C. No. 2830 of 2013
                                      4

                  "57.  The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........   But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

Crl.M.C. No. 2830 of 2013
                                    5

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite         full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

                               6

Annexurea-A1 and A2        and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No. 201/2012 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri and all further proceedings

thereto.

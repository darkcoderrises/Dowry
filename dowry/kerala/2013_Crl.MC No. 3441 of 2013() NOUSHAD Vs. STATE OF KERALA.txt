               ---------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
               ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 16th day of August, 2013.


                             O R D E R




                 The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No. 42/2012 in C.C.No

507/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pattambi

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime No.

42/2012 of Chalissery Police Station] for the offences punishable

under Section 498 (A) read with Sec.34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure A2 final report and all proceedings in C.C

No.507/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pattambi

as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.      The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner

herein married the de facto complainant, who is the second

respondent herein on 20.01.2008 in accordance with the religious

customs and rights prevailing among the muslims and while she

was residing in the matrimonial home, she was subjected to

harrasment demanding more dowry and thereby accused five in

numbers have committed the offences punishable under Section

498 A read with 34 of Indian Penal Code. Nows the case of the

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                  2

petitioner is that while the above case is pending, the dispute both

matrimonial and criminal are settled amicably and the first

petitioner as well as the second respondent are residing together

and leading a peaceful marital life. Thus, the second respondent

has sworn into an affidavit dated 06.08.2013.and now, the case of

the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.       Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received     from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                  3

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.      I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of

the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Section 498 (A) read with Sec.34 of I.P.C which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.

It is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that the the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex

Court, in the decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and

Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD

817(SC)], has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                    4

                 "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial

          disputes have been on considerable increase in

          recent times resulting in filing of complaints

          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only

          against the husband but also against the

          relatives of the husband. The question is when

          such matters are resolved either by the wife

          agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by

          mutual settlement of other pending disputes for

          which both the sides approached the High Court

          and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal

          proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife

          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether

          the prayer can be declined on the sole ground

          that since the offences are non-compoundable

          under Section 320 of the Code, it would be

          impermissible for the court to quash the

          criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                 8. It is not in dispute that in the case on

          hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal

          complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC

          and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                   5

          Act, 1961, with the help and intervention of

          family members, friends and well-wishers, the

          parties concerned have amicably settled their

          differences         and       executed         a

          compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the

          appellants filed the said compromise before the

          Trial Court with a request to place the same on

          record and to drop the criminal proceedings

          against the appellants herein. It is also not in

          dispute that in additional to the mutual

          settlement     arrived  at   by   the    parties,

          respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

          stating that she did not wish to pursue the

          criminal proceedings against the appellants and

          fully supported the contents of the settlement

          deed. It is the grievance of the appellants that

          no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of

          the parties but also the High Court failed toe

          exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of

          the Code only on the ground that the criminal

          proceedings relate to the offences punishable

          under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                   6

          non-compoundable in nature."

                 "12.   In our view, it is the duty of the

          Courts to      encourage genuine settlements of

          matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the

          same are on considerable increase. Even if the

          offences are non-compoundable, if they relate

          to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

          satisfied that the parties have settled the same

          amicably and without any       pressure, we hold

          that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,

          Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to

          the exercise of power of quashing of FIR,

          complaint      or   the   subsequent     criminal

          proceedings.

                    13.   There has been an outburst of

          matrimonial disputes in recent times.        The

          institution of marriage occupies an important

          place and it has an important role to play in the

          society.     Therefore, every effort should be

          made in the interest of the individuals in order

          to enable them to settle down in life and live

          peacefully.    If the parties ponder over their

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                   7

          defaults and terminate their disputes amicably

          by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out

          in a Court of law, in order to do complete

          justice in the matrimonial matters, the Courts

          should be less hesitant in exercising its

          extraordinary jurisdiction.  It is trite to state

          that the power under Section 482 should be

          exercised sparingly and with circumspection

          only when the Court is convinced, on the basis

          of material on record, that allowing the

          proceedings to continue would be an abuse of

          the process of the Court or that the ends of

          justice require that the proceedings ought to be

          quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C.        The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case as

well.

          8.    According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view

of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

Crl.M.C. No. 3441 OF 2013
                                    8

the above decision will be squarely applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in

the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings.          Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -

A2 final report and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 507 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pattambi.

                      P.BHAVADASAN, J.
              ---------------------------------------
              Bail Application No.1779 OF 2013
              ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 23rd day of March, 2013.


                            O R D E R


     The petitioner is 1st accused in Crime No.338/2013 of

Vatakara Police Station who is alleged to have committed the

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A of the Indian

Penal Code. The allegation against the petitioner is that he used

to harass the de facto complainant demanding more dowry and

thereby committed the offence. The petitioner would say that he

is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the matter.     He

seeks pre-arrest bail.

     2.   Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition and

pointed out that the investigation is at an infant stage.

     3. After having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner,

the learned Public Prosecutor and after having perused the

records, the claim of the petitioner that he is innocent cannot be

accepted.

     4.   Considering the nature of the allegations against the

B.A.No.1779/2013                  2


petitioner, the manner in which the offece was committed and

also the fact that the investigation is at an infant stage, it is felt

that this is not a fit case where extra ordinary jurisdiction needs

to be exercised in favour of the petitioner.        Therefore, the

application is to be dismissed and I do so.

        However, if the petitioner is so advised, he may surrender

before the Investigating Officer on or before 01.04.2013 who,

after interrogation, shall produce him before the Magistrate court

concerned who, on an application of bail being moved by the

petitioner, shall dispose of the same in accordance with law,

keeping in view the fact that the accused Nos.2 to 4 have already

been released on bail, preferably on the same day of surrender.

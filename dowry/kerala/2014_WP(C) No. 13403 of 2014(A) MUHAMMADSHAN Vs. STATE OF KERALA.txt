                                      JUDGMENT


RAMACHANDRA MENON, J.

      Petitioner has approached this Court with the following

prayers:

      (a) issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,
      order or direction directing the third respondent not to
      harass the petitioner and his family members.

      (b) issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,
      order or direction directing the second respondent to dispose
      of Ext.P3 representation within a time limit to be prescribed
      by this honourable Court.

      (c) pass any other appropriate writ, order or direction which
      this honourable Court may deem fit to issue and the
      petitioner may pray from time to time.

      2. The case of the petitioner is that the marriage between the

petitioner and the daughter of fourth respondent was proposed to be

conducted on 27.4.2014 and in connection with the marriage the

petitioner had made all necessary arrangements. Later, the fourth

respondent retreated from the commitment, alleging that the

W.P.(C)No.13403 OF 2014
                                    : 2 :




petitioner's family did not have the requisite social status and also that

the food served on 'Nikkah' function was not upto standard.             The

petitioner issued Ext.P2 lawyer notice and took steps to file a suit for

damages. According to the petitioner, the third respondent is harassing

the petitioner and his family under the influence of fourth respondent

to see that the petitioner does not take any legal action against the

fourth respondent and his family. Hence this writ petition.

       3. Learned Government Pleader, on instruction, submits that the

fourth respondent has filed a complaint before the third respondent in

respect of the offence committed by the petitioner in claiming dowry for

contracting the marriage. Crime No.684/2014 has been registered by

the Pandalam Police under the relevant provisions of law and the

investigation is going on. It is stated that there is absolutely no instance

of harassment of the petitioner or his family members.

       4. In the above circumstances, this Court finds that this is not a fit

case to call for interference. The submission made by the learned

Government Pleader that police will not cause any harassment and that

they are only proceeding with the investigation of the crime is recorded.

W.P.(C)No.13403 OF 2014
                                   : 3 :




It is open to the petitioner to approach competent civil court, if at all

any civil right has been infringed.

       Writ petition is dismissed.

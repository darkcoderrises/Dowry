          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 20th day of March, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

accused in Crime No.126/2012 of Museum Police Station,

for quashing further proceedings thereon, on the basis of

the settlement arrived at between the parties under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called

the `Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.126/2012

of Museum Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, which was


registered on the basis of a complaint given by the 3rd

respondent, alleging offences under Section 323 and 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.                     The allegation was that on

27.01.2012 the petitioners have abused the defacto-

complainant, removed the articles belonging to the defacto-

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                             2

complainant who belongs to Scheduled Caste and working

as Security guard in the apartment, in which the petitioners

are residing by calling his caste name and prevented him

from doing his employment in that flat as security and

declared that they will not allow him to do his work and

thereby they have committed the above said offence. In

respect of this incident, there were other litigations also,

pending before the Consumer Redressal Forum and other

Civil Courts and due to the intervention of well-wishers, all


the cases have been settled. The 3rd respondent has no

intention to proceed with this case also, in view of the fact

that, the mis-understanding has been resolved and he has

been permitted to work in the flat in an amicable manner.

Since it is in the crime stage, neither the police nor the

court will allow compounding.    Further the offences are

non-compoundable in nature as well and no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case. So, the petitioners have

no other remedy, except to approach this court, seeking

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                                   3

following relief:

            "Hence it is prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
      to allow this criminal miscellaneous case and quash Annexure-I
      proceedings Crime No.126/2012 of Museum Police Station,
      pending on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,
      Thiruvananthapuram."


            3.    The 3rd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and good relationship has been restored on

account of the settlement. So, he does not want to proceed

with the prosecution and he had also filed Annexure-3

affidavit stating these facts.

            4.    The     learned       Public     Prosecutor      on

instructions as directed by this court submitted that, there

is another case also pending against the first petitioner

apart from this case and opposed the application.

            5.    The counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

the other case mentioned against the first petitioner is also

settled and they have filed Crl.M.C.No.1622/2014 to quash

that proceedings, which is also pending before this court

and coming up for hearing today.

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                                 4


            6.    It is an admitted fact that, the 3rd respondent

is working as a security guard in the flat in which the

petitioners are residing. It is true that, there was some mis-


understanding arose between the 3rd respondent and the

petitioners and other residents of the complex, regarding


the continuance of the 3rd respondent, as security in that

complex and the cases mentioned above have arisen on

account of that mis-understanding. Apart from this case,

there are other cases arose between the flat owners and the

builder and all those cases were settled between the

parties, evidenced by Annexure-2 agreement.             It is true

that, the offence alleged is of grave nature and is covered

by a special statute, which has been enacted to protect the

interest of persons belonging to that category of persons.

But at the same time, if the incident happened on account of

some mis-understanding and those mis-understanding has

been resolved due to settlement and both parties have

restored their relationship and want to have smooth and

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                                     5

happy atmosphere and living situation in the complex where

they are living, then the pendency of this case should not be

a hurdle for promoting such aspect, especially when the

person affected had himself come before this court and

stated that, it was due to some mis-understanding that the

cases have been filed and that words of the victim have to

be honoured for the purpose of promoting the settlement

that has been arrived at, which will promote harmony in the


complex, where the petitioners are living and the 3rd

respondent is working as a security.

            7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.    In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an no

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                                       6

      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the matter has

been settled between the parties and on account of the

settlement, the relationship has been restored and peaceful

Crl.M.C. No.1622 of 2014
                                7

atmosphere has been brought among the residents of the

residential complex, where the petitioners are residing and


the 3rd respondent is working as security. Taking this an

exceptional case, though the offence alleged is covered by a

special statute intended to protect the interest of persons

belonging to that category of persons mentioned in the

statute, this court feels that the power under Section 482 of

the `Code' has to be invoked to quash the proceedings, as

no purpose will be served by allowing the case to continue,

in view of the settlement, as even the defacto-complainant

will not co-operate with the investigation and if ultimately

final report is filed, he will not support the prosecution at

the time of trial as well. So the application is allowed and

further proceedings in Crime No.126/2012 of Museum

Police Station, filed before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram, as against the

petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate

this order to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,

Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, for taking necessary

further action in this regard.

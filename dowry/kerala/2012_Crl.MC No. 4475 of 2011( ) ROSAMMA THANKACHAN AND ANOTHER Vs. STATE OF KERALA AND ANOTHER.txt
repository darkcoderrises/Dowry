          -------------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 13th day of September, 2012


                                ORDER



     Petitioners are accused numbers 4 and 5 in a pending case

numbered as C.C No.641 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Ambalappuzha.                  They are being

prosecuted with another (A1) for the offences punishable under

Sections 107, 108, 351, 352, 358, 498A, 403, 323 and 506 r/w

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code on a report filed by the Sub

Inspector of Police, Ambalappuzha.



     2.   Annexure A2 is a copy of the final report in the crime

registered on a compliant filed by the second respondent before

the judicial Magistrate and referred to police for investigation

under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for

short, 'the Code'. After completion of the investigation, five

accused persons including the present petitioners arraying them

as A4 and A5, were indicted of offences as indicated above.

Second respondent/de facto complainant is the wife of the first

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011             2



accused and the other accused are his close relatives.        As

against two among the accused arrayed in the report, A2 and

A3, criminal proceedings against them on the basis of such

report had been quashed by this court vide Annexure 4 order.

A4 is the sister of A1 and A5, son of A4.        They seek for

quashing the criminal proceedings against them invoking the

inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of the Code

contending that the continuation of such proceedings against

them is an abuse of process of the court.



      3. I heard the counsel on both sides. Adverting to the

complaint filed before the Magistrate, copy of which is

produced as Annexure A1, the learned counsel contended that

the allegations imputed therein are grossly insufficient to

implicate these petitioners, A4 and A5, for any of the offences

alleged against them. It is further contended that whatever

circumstances taken note of by this court in favour of A2 and

A3 are applicable in the case of the present petitioners also, to

quash the criminal proceedings against them in the case. The

imputations made in Annexure A1 complaint, it is stated, are so

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011             3



vague and that they do not constitute sufficient grounds to

proceed against these petitioners for the grave offences

imputed against them.        Per contra, the learned counsel

appearing for the second respondent pointing out the

allegations raised in Annexure A1 complaint contended that

specific imputations have been made implicating these

petitioners in abetting and more so in assisting the first

accused, A1, her husband, to inflict serious injury both

physically and mentally on her to satisfy his demand for dowry.

Circumstances presented in the case disclose the joint

culpability of these petitioners with the main culprit, husband,

in the commission of the offences involved, which have been so

found after a full pledged investigation by the police, is the

further submission of the counsel to contend that the exercise

of inherent jurisdiction as canvassed for in the petition is not

called for, to quash the proceedings against the petitioners.

Petitioners are free to canvass whatever defences available to

them in the trial when cognizance of the offences against them

on the police report laid had been taken by the Magistrate, is

the further submission.

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011               4



      4. After going through the allegations set out in Annexure

A1 complaint and also Annexure A2 final report filed by the

police after investigation, I find considerable force in the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioners

that the criminal proceedings launched against the petitioners

on the allegations imputed that they are jointly culpable with

the first accused, husband of the second respondent, in

inflicting matrimonial cruelty and various other criminal acts

against her, are vague and inscrutable and continuation of the

criminal proceedings against them in the given facts of the

case would be nothing, but, an abuse of process of the court. In

Annexure A1 complaint imputations made against these

petitioners are to the effect that the fourth accused

accommodated her brother, first accused, and his wife, second

respondent, in her house for a few days. Fourth accused is

stated to be residing 15 Kms. away from the matrimonial house

of the second respondent.        While such accommodation was

provided, when a birthday function of the child of the second

respondent took place, fourth accused made some comments

and, later, in the night, first accused assaulted his wife, second

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011            5



respondent, is the allegation imputed with an addition that

such assault was abetted by the fourth accused. If that be the

allegation against the fourth accused, I do not find anything

worth mentioning in the complaint to rope in the fifth accused

as jointly culpable for having committed any criminal act

against the second respondent. So far as the allegation in the

complaint to implicate the fourth accused, it is noticed that no

scrap of paper had been produced to show that the de facto

complainant suffered any injury at the hands of her husband on

account of the assault allegedly made on her in the incident,

which is    stated to have occurred in the house of fourth

accused. She filed the complaint long after such incident is

also borne out by the complaint.     Allegation set out in the

complaint would also indicate that after the alleged incident

there were talks for resolving the matrimonial disputes

between the spouses, first accused in the crime and second

respondent, but, such steps were not fruitful. The material

averments made in the petition would disclose that even if any

objectionable act was done by the fourth accused prior to such

settlement talks, the de facto complainant was prepared to

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011             6



condone the same to have a peaceful matrimonial life with her

husband. In that back drop, when the allegations made out in

the complaint are looked into, I find, this is not a fit case where

the second respondent would be justified in setting forth the

law against the fourth accused and her son with a case that

she had abetted the first accused in assaulting her.          Other

allegations made out in the complaint to implicate the fourth

accused are also found to be too vague which do not require

any reference at all. Needless to point out in a matrimonial

proceeding initiated by the wife against her husband and his

close relatives, prudence and caution demands scrutiny of such

allegations      to   examine      whether      the       aggrieved

person/complainant is justified in proceeding against the

relatives of the husband. Naturally, in view of the surcharged

atmosphere arising from the matrimonial disputes there may

be a tendency to implicate the close relatives of the husband

as well. Unless sufficient particulars are given in the complaint

justifying the involvement of the relatives, a prima facie view

that the relatives of the husband are also jointly culpable with

him in committing any criminal act of harassment or cruelty

Crl.M.C No.4475/2011            7



against the wife to proceed against them will not be justified.

The petitioners are also entitled to have the case proceeded

against them quashed applying the same yardsticks followed

by this court in passing Annexure A4 order in favour of two

other accused, A2 and A3 in the case.           The criminal

proceedings against A4 and A5 in C.C No.641/2010 on the file

of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ambalappuzha are

quashed under Section 482 of the Code.

      Petition is allowed.

                  Crl.M.C. No. 3258 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 26th day of June, 2014

                           O R D E R

     This is an application filed by accused nos. 1 to 5 in

C.C. No. 2506/2013 pending before Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha, to quash the proceedings on

the basis of the settlement under section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused nos. 1 to 5 in Crime No.828/2013 of

Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha District on the basis

of the statement given by the de facto complainant - the

second respondent, alleging offences under sections 143,

147, 148, 452 and 324 r/w 149 of Indian Penal Code. After

investigation, final report has been filed and the case is now

taken on file as C.C. 2506/2013 and pending before Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Allapuzha. Petitioners 1 to 5

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                              -2-



and respondents 2 and 3 are close relatives and neighbours.

In fact, there was some misunderstanding in respect of the

marriage of the daughter of the first accused with the son of

the de facto complainant and that resulted in the

unfortunate incident.     Now, all the disputes have been

settled and the marriage has been accepted by both parties

and they are living happily now. In view of the settlement,

there is no possibility of conviction and since some of the

offences are non compoundable in nature, they could not

file application before the concerned court for recording

compounding.       So the petitioners have no other remedy

except to approach this court seeking the following reliefs

            "For these and other grounds that may

            be urged at the time of hearing, this

            Hon'ble Court may be pleased to allow

            this petition and quash all further

            proceedings in      C.C. No.2506/2013

            (Crime No.828/2013 of Mannancherry

            Police Station, Alappuzha District), on

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                               -3-



            the files of learned Judicial First Class

            Magistrate's Court-I, Alappuzha, so as to

            secure the ends of justice."

      3.    Respondents 2 and 3 appeared before this Court

through counsel and submitted that the matter has been

settled between the parties and now the marriage between

the son of the de facto complainant and the daughter of the

first accused was accepted by the family members and they

are now living together and harmony has been restored

between them. So they do not want to prosecute the case

any longer. They also stated that they have filed affidavit

stating these facts.

      4.    The    counsel for the petitioners also submitted

that in view of the settlement there is no possibility of

conviction and he also prayed for allowing the application.

      5.    Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners, but considering the nature of the

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                               -4-



offences alleged, opposed the application.

      6.    It is an admitted fact that petitioners 1 to 5 and

respondents 2 and 3 are close relatives and neighbours. It

is also an admitted fact that the son of the de facto

complainant married the daughter of the first accused,

which caused some misunderstanding between these two

families and resulted in an incident causing injury to the de

facto complainant and another.       So, on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant, Crime

No.828/2013 of Mannancherry Police Station was registered

against the petitioners alleging offences under sections 143,

147, 148, 452 and 324 r/w 149 of Indian Penal Code and

after investigation, final report was filed and it is now

pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Alappuzha as C.C.2506/2013.        Now the matter has been

settled between the parties.

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                                  -5-



      7.    The de facto complainant and other injured, who

were arrayed as respondents 2 and 3, appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled and

the marriage between the son of the de facto complainant

and the daughter of the first accused was accepted by both

families and old relationship between them has been

restored on account of the settlement. So, in view of the

settlement there is no possibility of conviction as well, as

neither the de facto complainant nor their witnesses will

support the case of the prosecution.

      8.    Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
     from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
     the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
     wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
     exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
     power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
     abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                                    -6-



     quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
     exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
     dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of
     each case and no category can be prescribed. However,
     before exercise of such power, the High Court must have
     due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous
     and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like
     murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
     even though the victim or victim's family and the offender
     have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in
     nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any
     compromise between the victim and offender in relation to
     the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
     Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
     servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
     for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving
     such    offences.       But   the    criminal   cases    having
     overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
     different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
     the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
     civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences
     arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the
     family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
     personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
     entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court may
     quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
     compromise      between     the  offender   and    victim,  the
     possibility   of  conviction   is  remote    and    bleak  and
     continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
     oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
     caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
     and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
     In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
     would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
     continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
     criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process
     of law despite settlement and compromise between the
     victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
     justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and
     if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                                 -7-



     High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the
     criminal proceeding."



      9.    It has been held that in a case where the incident

occurred due to some misunderstanding between the

neighbours      and   family    members         which     resulted  in

registration of the crime and filing of the final report and

ultimately if the entire dispute is resolved due to mediation

and interference of family members and well wishers of both

parties, then the Court must always honour such settlement

and promote harmony that has been restored among the

neighbours and family members and in such cases even

though     some    non    compoundable          offence    has    been

committed, the Court must invoke section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings and promote

settlement and harmony that has been restored among the

family members

      10. In view of the dictum laid in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the incident itself has

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                               -8-



happened on account of misunderstanding caused in

connection with the marriage of the son of the de facto

complainant with the daughter of the first accused and that

dispute has been now resolved and they are now residing

happily and on account of the settlement there is no

possibility of conviction, this Court feels that it is a fit case

where power under section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings in

order to promote the settlement, which resulted in harmony

among the family members of petitioner's son and

respondents 2 and 3 and the pendency of this case should

not be a hurdle for the same.

      11. So the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C. 2506/2013 (Crime No.828/2013 of Mannancherry

Police Station) pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Alappuzha as against the petitioners is quashed.

Crl.M.C. No. 3258/2014
                             -9-




      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

                     ----------------------------------------
                        Crl.M.C.No. 3511 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                    The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime No.51/2008 of

Venjarammoodu Police Station, now pending as S.C.No. 669/2011 of the

Assistant Sessions Court, Nedumangadu for the offences punishable under

Sections 342,324,308 od I.P.C. and Section 9 of the Explosive Substance

Act with a prayer to quash the entire proceedings in S.C.No.669/2011 on

the file of Assistant Sessions Court, Nedumangadu and the entire

proceedings initiated against the petitioner pursuant to it as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case against the accused is that

on 2.2.2008 at 10 p.m. he attacked the first respondent and caused hurt to

his body near Pallimon devi temple, Anachal, Thiruvananthapuram district

and now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court,

Crl.M.C.No.3511 of 2013


                                      :-2-:

since the petitioner and the first respondent are neighbours and the entire

incident originated connected with the family dispute.              The first

respondent has sworn into Annexure A2 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the first

respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

Crl.M.C.No.3511 of 2013


                                        :-3-:

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

342,324,308 od I.P.C. and Section 9 of the Explosive Substance Act which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From

the submission made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me

that the      de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.             In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

Crl.M.C.No.3511 of 2013


                                           :-4-:

           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.No.3511 of 2013


                                     :-5-:

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.         Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing the entire

proceedings in S.C.No.669/2011 on the file of Assistant Sessions Court,

Nedumangadu and the entire proceedings initiated against the petitioner

pursuant to it.

                                                                      sd/-

                                                                   Judge

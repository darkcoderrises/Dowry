               Dated this the 12th May, 2015

                            O R D E R

     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.336/14 of

Thumba Police Station, registered under Section 309 IPC.

Later Section 304B read with 34 IPC was incorporated.

First petitioner is the husband of the deceased. The other

petitioners are his close relatives. The allegation is that

the petitioners subjected the deceased to cruelty

demanding dowry and it caused her to commit suicide.

     Heard.

     The dying declaration recorded by the learned

Magistrate has been produced as Annexure-VII. The

declarant told the Magistrate that she poured kerosene

over herself and set herself on fire with intent to frighten

her husband, the first petitioner. There is no whisper

about any of the petitioners subjecting her to cruelty. The

prosecution is yet to collect evidence to prove commission

   BA.2542/15                   2

of offences by the petitioners. So, I am inclined to grant

bail to the petitioner.

      In the result, this application is allowed.

      i)    The petitioners shall be released on bail

            after interrogation on their executing a

            bond for 25,000/- (Rupees twentyfive

            thousand only) each with two solvent

            sureties each for the like sum if they are

            arrested by the Police in connection with

            this case.

      ii)   They shall appear before the Investigating

            Officer for interrogation if they are so

            required by the Investigating Officer in

            writing.

      iii)   They shall not destroy or tamper with

            evidence.

      iv)   In case of violation of any of the above

            conditions,   the   learned     Magistrate is

            empowered      to    cancel     the  bail in

            accordance with the law.

                         B.A.No.2763 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 6th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This is an application for               anticipatory bail filed         by

accused    1 and 2 in Crime No.377/2014 of Nilambur Police

station under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the

first  accused married the defacto complainant on 15.9.2013

and thereafter they were residing together as husband and wife

in the house of the accused and while so, they have ill treaded

her demanding more dowry and also manhandled her when

she refused to hand over the gold ornaments and thereby they

have committed the offences punishable under Sections 498 A,

323 read with Section 34 of the Indian penal Code.

      3. The counsel for the petitioners                       submitted that the

petitioners have not        committed any offence                    and they are

innocent of the same and they have been falsely implicated in

the case. In fact the 1st petitioner is a Government servant and

even on the earlier occasion, the defacto complainant had left

the house and on the basis of the mediation, they started living

B.A.No.2763 of 2014             2

together and in order to harass the petitioners, she had filed a

false complaint now. He prayed for allowing the application.

      4. The application was opposed by the learned       Public

Prosecutor on the ground that     investigation is not over and

even earlier there was some manhandling and after mediation

she came back and started living together and the medical

certificate   will go   to show that both the      accused have

assaulted her demanding dowry.

      5. Heard both sides and perused the records.

       6. It is seen from the records that the above case was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the defacto

complainant, who is non other than the wife of the first

petitioner and daughter-in-law of the second petitioner alleging

offences under Section 498 A and 323 read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code. It is true that her statement was

recorded from the hospital and the wound certificate of the

defacto complainant shows that she complained of pain on the

lower abdomen and the cause of injury was shown as repeated

assault by the husband and mother in law relating to dowry.

She was brought to the hospital by her mother. It is true that

dowry harassment must be viewed by the courts very seriously.

But at the same time, if any of the spouses were sent to jail on

the basis of the allegations of commission of offence under

Section 498 A, then the possibility of settlement in future will

be affected.     Further     considering the nature of    allegations

made, custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not required

as well.      So considering the broad aspect of the matrimonial

dispute, this Court feels that anticipatory bail can be granted to

the the petitioners with some stringent conditions. So the

application is allowed with the following conditions.

       i. If the petitioners are arrested in connection with Crime

No. 377/2014 of Nilambur police station, then the respondent is

directed to release the petitioners on bail on executing a bond

for Rs.25,000/- each with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum      to the satisfaction of the    arresting officer/respondent/

investigating officer as the case may be.

       ii. The petitioners shall appear before the investigating

officer three consecutive days between 9 am and 12 noon for

the purpose of interrogation in connection with the above crime

immediately after such arrest and release and thereafter as

and when required by him for this purpose in writing to do so

till the final report is filed.

     iii. The petitioners shall appear before the investigating

officer on the last Saturday of every month between 9 am and

10 am till the final report is filed.

     iv. The petitioners shall not intimidate or influence the

witnesses.

     v. The petitioners shall co-operate with the investigation of

the case as well.

     vi. If the petitioners surrender before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Nilambur and move for regular bail,

then the learned Magistrate is directed to release the petitioners

on bail on the same conditions as stated above.

     With the above conditions, this petition is allowed.

                 Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.398

of 2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chittur,

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No. 243/2008 of Kozhinjampara Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of I.P.C.,

with a prayer to quash all further proceedings in

C.C.No.398/2008 pending before the JFCM court, Chittur,

arisen out of Crime No.243/2008, as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner who is a temple priest approached the 2nd

respondent and his wife and offered to conduct various

'poojas' for fulfilling their dreams to have a baby and

obtained `38,000/- and 6 sovereigns of gold ornaments for

that purpose. But the 2nd respondent and his wife did not

get back the ornaments from the petitioner, after the

                               2
Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013


poojas, as assured by the petitioner. Now, the petitioner

had returned the entire amount to the 2nd respondent and

the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of

court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case.       Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from them has submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainants do not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioner and

they have no grievance against him.

         6.    I    have carefully  considered    the   above

                              3
Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013


submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under sections 406 and

420 of IPC, which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.      From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to me

that the the de facto complainants have no further

grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

                                4
Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013


in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)],

in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:      the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but
         it has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i)
         to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
         In what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend
         on the facts and circumstances of each
         case and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having
         overwhelmingly       and   pre-dominatingly
         civil flavour stand on different footing for
         the purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences      arising   from   commercial,
         financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
         such like transactions or the offences
         arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where
         the wrong is basically private or personal
         in nature and the parties have resolved
         their entire dispute. In this category of
         cases, High Court may quash criminal

                                 5
Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013


         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is
         remote and bleak and continuation of
         criminal case would put accused to great
         oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not
         quashing the criminal case despite     full
         and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. I am of the view that, as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding in the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

                               6
Crl.M.C.No.2178 of 2013


granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - 1 and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in C.C.No. 398 of 2008 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Chittur.

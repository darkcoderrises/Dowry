    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014
    ==============================
      Dated this, the 18th day of February, 2014.


                           O R D E R

      This is an application filed by accused Nos.6 and 7 in

S.C.No.37/14 on the file of the Additional Sessions Judge,

Wynad to quash the proceedings as against them under

Section 428 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement given by first respondent herein as CW1, Sulthan

Bathery police has registered a case as Crime No.1050/12

alleging offences under Sections.143, 144, 147, 148, 324, 308

read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code against the

petitioners and others.    After investigation, final report was

filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No-I,

Sulthan Bathery, where it was taken on file as C.P.No.37/13.

Thereafter, it was committed to Sessions Court, Wynad, where

it was taken on file as S.C.No.37/14 and it was made over to

Additional Sessions Court, Wynad for disposal and it is pending

before that court now. No offence under Section 308 is

attracted in this case. None of the injured have sustained any

injury of grave nature so as to attract the offence under

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014         :  2 :

Section 308 of Indian Penal Code. Further, the petitioners

have been selected for Army and Police Department

respectively, pendency of this case will affect their future

prospects. So, due to the intervention of respective persons

and mediators, the de facto complainant and other injured

persons have settled the dispute as far as the petitioners are

concerned.       The incident occurred as an aftermath of an

incident occurred in the Co-operative College in connection

with Arts Festival conducted in that college. Now, they are

repenting for their act and unless the case against them is

quashed recording the compositions they will be put to serious

action. There is no public interest involved as well. So, they

have no other option but to approach this court seeking the

following relief:

                "i)     To quash Annexure 1 Final Report in SC 37/14

   on the file of the Additional Sessions Judge, Wynad, in the

   interest of justice."

      3.     CWs 1 to 3 who were shown as respondents 1 to 3

appeared through counsel and also filed Annexure A2 to A4

affidavits stating that considering the peculiar circumstances

in which the petitioners are placed and non-quashing of the

case against them will affect their future, they have decided to

forgive them and settle the matter as far as the petitioners

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014      :   3 :

are concerned. They have no objection in quashing the

proceedings as against the petitioners.

      4.     The Govt.Pleader on instructions submitted that

except this case, the petitioners have not involved in any

other case and they have no criminal background as well.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that incident happened at the

time when the petitioners were students of Co-operative

College, Sulthan Bathery.       It is also an admitted fact in

connection with the incident, a crime was registered as crime

No.1050/12 of Sulthan Bathey Police Station on the basis of

the statement given by the first respondent herein alleging

commission of offences under Sections.143, 144, 147, 148,

324, 308 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and after

completion of investigation and filing final report, the case is

now pending before Additional Sessions Court, Kalpatta as

S.C.No.37/14 and the present petitioners were arrayed as

accused Nos. 6 and 7 in that case. It is true that the offences

alleged are grave in nature. I am not at this stage going to

the question as to whether the offence under Section 308 of

Indian Penal Code will be attracted or not. But, going through

the allegations and the overt act alleged against the

petitioners in the incident, it appears that the allegations

against the petitioners are not of grave nature. Further, CWs

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014           :   4 :

1 to 3 who are injured persons including the de facto

complainant who are shown as respondents 1 to 3 in this

petition have shown magnanimity in forgiving the wrongful act

of the petitioners considering the fact that they have got

employment opportunity in Army and Police Department

respectively. Continuation of this case may affect their future

as well.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion

     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in

     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

     the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

     offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

     plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

     in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

     secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

     process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the

     criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised

     where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

     depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

     category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such

     power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and

     gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

     depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot

     be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family

     and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are

     not private in nature and have serious impact on society.

     Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014            :  5 :

     relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention

     of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants

     while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis

     for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But

     the   criminal    cases    having   overwhelmingly     and    pre-

     dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

     purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

     commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such

     like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

     relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong

     is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

     resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

     Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of

     the compromise between the offender and victim, the

     possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

     criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

     prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

     quashing    the   criminal    case despite   full  and   complete

     settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

     the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

     contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

     proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would

     tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

     compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to

     secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

     put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

     affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction

     to quash the criminal proceeding."



       7.    In the above decision, it has been observed by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court that High Courts should not normally

invoke Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of

grave offences involving public interest.                   This incident

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014      :   6 :

happened on account of some political affiliation of the

petitioners in student politics while they were studying in Co-

operative College. It is high time to repeat that students are

now     involving      in such    criminal  activities, without

understanding the consequences of the same and as to how it

is likely to affect their future, on account of some instigation

and enthusiasm given by the political parties. By the time

they realize their folly, it has become too late for them as

well. This is one such example. Now they realize their folly

and that has been magnanimously forgiven by the injured

persons as well considering the fact that this will affect their

future and prevent from getting employment in the

departments mentioned above. Though, this court is not

expected to invoke the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure in a piece meal manner for quashing the

proceedings against some of the accused persons alone,

considering the peculiar circumstances in this case that these

two petitioners have been selected in the Army and Police

Department and they are awaiting postings and pendency of

this case may affect their future and also considering the

circumstances that even the injured persons have come

forward     magnanimously     by   forgiving the    wrong  acts

committed by the petitioners considering their future, I feel

Crl.M.C.No.1160 of 2014      :  7 :

that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code

of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked so as to give them an

opportunity to settle down in life and not to promote them as

criminals in future. By getting employment, they may lead a

peaceful and normal life. Further, since the injured persons

have settled their dispute with the present petitioners, no

purpose will be served by continuing this case as against the

petitioners as there is no likelihood of any conviction being

entered into against the petitioners also. So, I feel that it is a

fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings

as against the petitioners alone.

      So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

S.C.No.37/14 (Crime No.1050/2012 of Sulthan Bathery police

station) as against the petitioners is quashed.        Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

immediately for further action.

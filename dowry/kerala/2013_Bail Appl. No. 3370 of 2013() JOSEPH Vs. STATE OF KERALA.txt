               Dated this the 12th day of June, 2013

                               O R D E R
                               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners         are      the       accused         in   Crime

No.579/2013 of Koratty Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 read with

Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 4th petitioner, by demanding more dowry

and also by complaining that she is not fair.

     4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The

crime has been registered on the basis of a private

complaint filed by the de facto complainant before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Chalakudy, which

BA.No.3370/2013
                                : 2 :



was referred to the police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. The

contents of the CD reveal that the investigation of this case

is practically over. The de facto complainant has also

approached the Family Court, Irinjalakkuda for nullity of

marriage. Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case and the present stage of the investigation, I do not

think that the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is

required for the continued investigation of this case. Matters

being so, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on

each of them executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty

five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

BA.No.3370/2013
                                : 3 :



            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

     a.m.     on   all Wednesdays         and  Saturdays,

     commencing from 19-06-2013 for a period of

     three months or till the filing of the final report in

     this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with

     the evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

     available for interrogation as and when required

     by the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

                      Crl.M.C.No. 2611 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 27th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.No.336 of 2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry          which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 105 of 2013 of

Kunnathunadu Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 448,323,294(b) read with 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure A1 Final Report in Crime No. 105/13 of Kunnathunadu

Police Station which is now numbered as C.C.No.336/13 of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry as the matter is settled out

of court.

         2.    The allegation against the petitioners/accused in the

above case is that they illegally trespassed into the house of the de

Crl.M.C.No.2611 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

facto complainant who is the second respondent and caused

voluntarily hurt to the de facto complainant and other injured persons,

who are respondents 3 and 4 and thereby committed the offences

punishable under Sections 448,323,294(b) read with 34 of I.P.C. and

now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

respondents 2 to 4, who are the de facto complainant and the injured.

I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.            To prove the

settlement arrived between the parties, the petitioners produced

Annexure A2 agreement and also produced Annexure A3 joint

statement and Annexures A4 to A6 affidavits.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2611 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

         5. The learned counsel for respondents 2 to 4, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondents submitted

that the above respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the

injured do not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

they have no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 448,323,294(b) read with 34 of I.P.C., which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

Crl.M.C.No.2611 of 2013

                                         :-4-:

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto complainant and other

injured persons have no further grievance against the petitioners/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture,

it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

Crl.M.C.No.2611 of 2013

                                                :-5-:

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

             case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

             injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

             despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in

the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in

Crl.M.C.No.2611 of 2013

                                  :-6-:

the present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure A1

Final Report in Crime No. 105/13 of Kunnathunadu Police Station

which is now numbered as C.C.No.336/13 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolencherry.

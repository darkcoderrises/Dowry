            CRL.M.C. Nos. 161 and 162 of 2015
            ...............................................................
             Dated this the 26th day of October, 2015

                                   O R D E R


      Petitioners are challenging Annexure-1 orders in both

the Crl.M.Cs. Petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.161/2015 is the father

of the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.162/2015. Through Annexure-

1 orders, proceedings have been initiated against the

petitioners under Section 107 Cr.P.C. by the learned Sub

Divisional Magistrate, Fort Kochi through M.C.Nos.281/14

and 282/14.

      2.    It is alleged that Crime No.1418/2013 was

registered     against         the      petitioners         for     the    offences

punishable under Sections 294(b) and 332 IPC read with

Section 34 IPC.             They have allegedly restrained and

obstructed the Income Tax officials, while a raid was being

CRL.M.C.Nos.161 & 162 of 2015
                                 -: 2 :-



conducted at the house of the petitioners. The amounts

seized in the said raid was handed over to the petitioners for

keeping it in safe custody. It is alleged that the said amount

was taken away by the petitioners thereby committing

criminal breach of trust, for which Crime No.1474/2013 of

the Thrikkakara Police Station was registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 461, 462 and 406 IPC

read with Section 34 IPC.

      3.     It is alleged that petitioners had tortured and

harassed CW3 by demanding dowry and has caused bodily

harm to the father of CW3, for which Crime No.250/2014 of

the Thrikkakara Police Station was registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 323 IPC read

with Section 34 IPC. The earlier two crimes are presently

pending trial.

      4.    The above cases are the only cases registered

against the petitioners. There is nothing to believe that there

is reasonable apprehension on the part of the police or

CRL.M.C.Nos.161 & 162 of 2015
                                 -: 3 :-



satisfaction on the part of the learned Sub Divisional

Magistrate that there is likelihood of breach of the peace or

commission of offence against public tranquility, from the

part of the petitioners. Annexures-1 proceedings have been

initiated only on the basis of the registration of the above

crimes against the petitioners. Annexure-1 orders do not

reveal any sufficient reason to have an apprehension that

there is likelihood of breach of the peace or commission of

offence against public tranquility by the petitioners. Matters

being so, Annexure-1 orders in both these Crl.M.Cs. are

liable to be quashed.

       In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed and

Annexure-1 orders in M.C.Nos.281/14 and 282/14 of the

Sub Divisional Magistrate's Court, Fort Kochi, are hereby

quashed.

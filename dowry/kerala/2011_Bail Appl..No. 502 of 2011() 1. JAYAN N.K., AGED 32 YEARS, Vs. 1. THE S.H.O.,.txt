             Bail Application No.502 of 2011
         ---------------------------------------------------
       Dated this the 27th day of January, 2011

                              ORDER

     The petitioner, who is accused No.1 in Crime No.503

of 2010 of Pazhayangadi Police Station for offences

punishable under Sections 498-A & 306 read with Section

34 I.P.C., seeks his enlargement on bail. The occurrence

took place on 01/12/2010. The petitioner was surrendered

on 13/01/2011.

     2.    The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the

application contending inter alia that petitioner who is the

husband of the deceased who committed suicide in the

matrimonial home on 01/12/2010 after the marriage on

06/09/2009 unable to endure the matrimonial cruelty on

account of dowry demand, has been absconding ever since

her death and it was only on the direction of this Court that

he surrendered before the Magistrate on 13/01/2011 and

was remanded to custody.

B.A.No.502/2011
                               2


      3.    Having regard to the gravity of the offences,

nature of the allegations levelled against the petitioner, the

relative conduct of the parties, the propensities of the

petitioner, the sentiments of the near relatives of the victim

and the other facts and circumstances of the case, I am of

the view that if the petitioner is released on bail, he will

definitely   influence   and   intimidate   the    prosecution

witnesses.    There is also the likelihood of the petitioner

making himself scarce and fleeing from justice. I am,

therefore, not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this

stage.

      This petition is accordingly dismissed.

                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 12th day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The petitioners are respectively accused nos.1 to 4

in Crime No.853/14 of Eloor Police Station.                They

approached    this    Court     seeking      anticipatory   bail

apprehending arrest in the above crime.

    2. The prosecution allegation is that the 1st petitioner

who is the 1st accused married one Dhanya of 3.5.2008

which was an arranged marriage.               According to the

prosecution, before and after the marriage, the petitioners/

accused demanded more dowry, even though the marriage

was fixed after settling the demanded dowry.           It is the

further case of the prosecution that after the marriage, the

wife of the 1st petitioner was subjected to cruelty both

physically and mentally demanding more dowry and thus

according to the prosecution, the accused 4 in numbers

B.A.No.5821 of 2014
                             2

have committed the offences punishable under section

498A, 324, r/w 34 of IPC and also committed offences

punishable under section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. Both the counsel for the petitioners as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the 1st petitioner

herein, who is the 1st accused in the above crime and

husband of the de facto complainant has been arrested

during the pendency of the above bail application and he is

subsequently released. In view of the above submission,

the above bail application with respect to the 1st petitioner

became infructuous and accordingly the bail application

with respect to the 1st petitioner is dismissed as

infructuous.

      5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are parents of the 1st

petitioner ; whereas the 4th petitioner is his brother and

they are implicated by the de facto complainant in the

B.A.No.5821 of 2014
                                3

above crime only to harass the petitioners and as such no

specific overtact is alleged against them. According to the

learned counsel, as the 1st accused released on bail after

his arrest, the other petitioners are entitled to get the relief

as sought for.      The learned Public Prosecutor has also

submitted that no specific overtact is alleged against the

remaining petitioners.     Having regard to the facts and

circumstances involved in the case, I am of the view that,

this petition can be allowed subject to terms.

      In the result, this bail application with respect to the

1st petitioner is dismissed as infructuous.     As far as the

petitioner nos.2 to 4 are concerned, there will be a

direction that in the event of arrest of these petitioners

connected with Crime No.853/14 of Eloor Police Station,

they shall be released on bail on each of them executing a

bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the

like amount to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer

in the above crime and on the following other conditions :

                                  4

             1. The 4th petitioner is directed to report before the
             Investigating Officer in the above Crime between 10
             and 11 a.m. on every Second Saturdays.

             2. The petitioner nos.2 and 3 are directed to report
             before the Investigating Officer as and when
             required.

            investigation and they shall not interfere with the
            same or attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper
            the evidence.

                 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - -
             Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                   ORDER

       Petition filed under Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

       2. The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.650/2014

of Balusseri Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A, 406 and 507 of the Indian Penal Code read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A(b) of

Information Technology Act.

       3.   The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed his wife, who is the de-facto complainant

herein, and treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry and

gold ornaments after misappropriating her 45 soverings of gold

ornaments and the amount received from the parents of the de-

facto complainant. He has harassed her by demanding an amount

of 30,00,000/- more. It is alleged that he has shared the nude

B.A.8336 of 2014                 2

photographs of the de-facto complainant, through whatsapp to

other persons, including the family members of the de-facto

complainant.

       4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

       5. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

de-facto complainant had illicit relationship and by chance, the

petitioner got a video clipping sent to him from one of his friends

and he could realise that the lady in the video clipping is none

other than the de-facto complainant, who is his wife. In order to

make aware of that fact to the family members of the de-facto

complainant, he forwarded it to the family members of the de-facto

complainant. The said contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioner is primafacie not believable.    It seems that he had

wilfully and deliberately defamed the de-facto complainant by

sending her nude photographs through whatsapp to other persons.

B.A.8336 of 2014                     3

The allegations are very grave and serious. The investigation is

not over. The other persons involved in the incident are yet to be

identified. Considering the serious allegations against the

petitioner and the present stage of investigation, I am satisfied that

this is not a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioner.

        In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

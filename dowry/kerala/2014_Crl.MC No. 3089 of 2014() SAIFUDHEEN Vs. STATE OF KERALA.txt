                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.3089 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 27th day of June, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by the accused

in  C.C.No.33/11 pending before                  the       Judicial   First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Kollam to quash the proceedings on the

basis of a settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners were

arrayed as accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.925/10 of Kollam West

police station registered on the basis of the statement given by

the   second     accused/defacto complainant alleging offences

under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) and 506(ii) read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was

filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.33/2011 and pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam.                  In

the meantime, the matter has been settled between the parties.

On account of the settlement, there is no possibility of

conviction. Since some of the offences are not compoundable

in nature, they could not file application before the court. So

Crl.M.C.No.3089 of 2014                  2

the petitioners have no other remedy except to approach this

Court seeking the following relief:

                      For these reasons, that may be allowed to be

               urged at the time of hearing, it is most respectfully

               prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash

               Annexure-B Final      report/charge   sheet in  Crime

               No.925/2010 of Kollam West Police Station as it is an

               abuse    of   process  of court   and  all subsequent

               proceedings pursuant to C.C.No.33/2011 on the file of

               the Judicial Magistrate Court-II, Kollam and pass such

               other order, as is   deemed fit, to secure the ends of

               justice in this case.

      3. The second respondent appeared though counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he has no objection in quashing the proceedings and he

filed affidavit stating these facts.

      4. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and

so, he prayed for allowing the application.

         5. The learned             Public Prosecutor, on institutions,

submitted that there is no other case against the petitioners,

but opposed the application on the ground that grave offences

have been incorporated.

      6. It is an admitted fact that the petitioners were arrayed

Crl.M.C.No.3089 of 2014             3

as accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.925/10 of Kollam West police

station on the basis of a statement given by the                second

respondent alleging offence under Sections 323, 324, 294(b)

and 506(ii) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It

is also an admitted fact that after investigation, Annexure-B

final report was filed and it is now pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam as C.C.No.33/2011. In

the mean time, the mater has been settled between the parties

due to intervention of well wishers of both parties. It is seen

from the statement that they are neighbours and on account of

the settlement, their relationship has been restored. Since the

matter has been        settled between the parties, no purpose will

be served by proceeding with the case as conviction in such

cases will be remote        as they will not support the case of the

prosecution and it will be only        wastage of     judicial time to

proceed with the case.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

          pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

Crl.M.C.No.3089 of 2014              4

          offences     arising   from   commercial,     financial

          mercantile,     civil,  partnership   or   such    like

          transactions    or    the offences   arising   out   of

          matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

          settlement and compromise with the victim.           In

          other words, the High Court must consider whether

          it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

          justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or

          continuation of the criminal proceedings would

          tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

          settlement and compromise between the victim and

          wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of

          justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

Crl.M.C.No.3089 of 2014               5

          an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is

          in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

          jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

       8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that it is a             dispute between the

neighbours, which resulted in registration of the crime and the

same has been settled between parties and no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case, this Court feels that it is a

fit case where power under Section 482 of the Code can be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote settlement and

harmony that has been restored on account of the settlement

and pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the same.

        9. So the application is allowed. Further proceedings in

C.C.No.33/2011 (Crime No.925/2010 of Kollam                West police

station) pending       against      the petitioners before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam is hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order               to the

concerned court immediately.

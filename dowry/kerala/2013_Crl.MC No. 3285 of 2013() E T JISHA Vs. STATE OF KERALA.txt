                       V.K.MOHANAN, J.
             ----------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 7th day of August, 2013

                            O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused in C.C.No.175/2008 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-V, Kozhikode which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.246/2006 of

Nallalam Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure-A2 final report in C.C.No.175 of 2008 on the

files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-V, Kozhikode

invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the

petitioner/accused may be acquitted as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2. The allegation against the accused in the complaint

is that she borrowed Rs.30,000/- from the de facto

complainant agreeing to return it in 3 months and when

demanded later she issued a cheque dated 20.3.2006 drawn

on the Catholic Syrian Bank forging her signature and this

Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013        2

cheque when presented for collection was returned for the

reason 'drawers signature differs' and thus cheated the

complainant and committed forgery and that in spite of a

notice demanding payment she has not discharged the liability.

Thus according to the prosecution the petitioner/accused has

committing the offences punishable under Sections 420, 465,

467, 468 and 471 of IPC. Now the case                    of the

petitioner/accused is that the entire dispute is settled with the

2nd respondent who is the de facto complainant. Accordingly,

the 2nd respondent de facto complainant has sworn into

Annexure -A4 affidavit. Annexure-A3 receipt is produced to

show that the de facto complainant has received the amount in

terms of the settlement.

             3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

             4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.             Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013             3

process of law and proceedings.

             5.      The learned counsel for the second respondent,

who on the basis of specific instruction received          from the

respondent, submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against her.

             6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

             7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 420, 465, 467, 468

and 471 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved.         It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013              4

second respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                      "57. The position that emerges from
             the above discussion can be summarised
             thus:      the power of the High Court in
             quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
             complaint     in   exercise  of   its  inherent
             jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
             power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
             compounding the offences under S.320 of
             the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
             plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
             has to be exercised in accord with the
             guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
             secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
             abuse of the process of any Court. In what
             cases      power    to  quash    the    criminal
             proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
             exercised where the offender and victim
             have settled their dispute would depend on
             the facts and circumstances of each case
             and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

             "......... But the criminal cases having
             overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
             flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes      of  quashing,  particularly   the
             offences       arising    from     commercial,

Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013             5

             financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
             such like transactions or the offences
             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
             is basically private or personal in nature
             and the parties have resolved their entire
             dispute.     In this category of cases, High
             Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
             its     view,  because  of   the compromise
             between the offender and victim, the
             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
             and continuation of criminal case would put
             accused to great oppression and prejudice
             and extreme injustice would be caused to
             him by not quashing the criminal case
             despite     full and complete settlement and
             compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter

is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

Crl.M.C.No. 3285 of 2013         6

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

             In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A2 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.175/2008 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-V, Kozhikode.

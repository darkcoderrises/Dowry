            Dated this the 26th day of September, 2008


                                  O R D E R

      This petition is for anticipatory bail.

      2.   The alleged offences are under Sections 498(A) and 34

IPC.   According to prosecution, first petitioner and the defacto

complainant were married on 27.4.2008 and they lived together as

husband and wife. The defacto complainant was residing in the

house of the elder brother of the first accused. The first accused

was having illicit relationship with the second accused who is none

other than the wife of his elder brother. He started demanding

dowry and money also and the defacto complainant was even

assaulted by the first accused. She was harassed by the second

accused and her parents also.

      3.   Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the

petitioners are innocent of the allegations made. Petitioners 2 to 4

are residing separately from the first accused. Petitioners 3 and 4

are the parents of the second accused. The allegations are false, it

is submitted.

      4.   This petition is opposed.               Learned public prosecutor

submitted that there are clear allegations of mental and physical

harassment at the hands of the accused nos.1 and 2. The defacto

BA No.4815/08                      2



complainant was assaulted on 11.7.2008 and she was hospitalised

and she had sustained injuries. She had lodged the complaint on

the very next day. However, learned public prosecutor submitted

that the third and the fourth petitioners are deleted from the array

of the accused. This submission is recorded.

      5.    On hearing both sides, I find that the marriage lasted

only for less than three months. As far as the third and the fourth

accused are concerned, prayer for anticipatory bail has become

infructuous. The nature of allegations made against first accused

are serious in nature. Hence, I am not inclined to grant

anticipatory bail.

      6.    The crime was registered as early as on 12.7.2008 and

the first and the second accused have not been available for arrest.

For the purpose of investigation, their presence will be required.

      7.    Hence, I direct accused nos. 1 and 2 to surrender

before the Investigating Officer or appear before the Magistrate

Court concerned within seven days from today.

      With this direction, this petition is dismissed.

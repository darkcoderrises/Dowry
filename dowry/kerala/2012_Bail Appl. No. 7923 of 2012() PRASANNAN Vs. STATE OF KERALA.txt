            Dated this the 31st day of October 2012

                                   Order

            This petition is filed under Section 438 of Cr.PC.,

seeking anticipatory bail. The petitioners are the accused in

Crime No.834/12 of Konni Police Station for having committed

the offences punishable under Sections 406, 498A r/w 34 IPC.

The marriage between the first petitioner and the defacto

complainant was solemnized on 20.01.2008 and a baby boy

was born to them in the wedlock.              The allegation against the

petitioners is that they harassed and tortured the defacto

complainant demanding more dowry.

            2. After having gone though the petition and heard

the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public

Prosecutor and also having gone through the CD, it is felt that

this is a fit case warranting exercise of the extra ordinary

jurisdiction of this court under Section 438 of Cr.PC.

Accordingly, this application is allowed as follows :

BA 7923/12                          2

1. The petitioners shall surrender before the Investigating

   Officer on or before 08.11.2012, who, after interrogation,

   shall produce them before the JFCM concerned.

2. On applications being filed by the petitioners before the

   JFCM concerned, they shall be released on bail on each of

   them executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten

   Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

   sum each to the satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

3. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

   sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts produced by

   the sureties before granting bail to the petitioners.

4. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer

   as and when required by him, till final report is filed.

5. The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

6. If any of the conditions is violated, the bail granted shall

   stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied

   of the said fact, may take such steps as are available to him

   in law.

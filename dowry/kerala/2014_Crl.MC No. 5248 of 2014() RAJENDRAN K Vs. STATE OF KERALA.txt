                Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 18th day of September, 2014.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in

S.C.No.140 of 2003 of the court of Assistant Sessions Judge

(Addl.), Palakkad, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.572 of 2000 of Palakkad Town South

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Section

306 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the proceedings in the

above sessions case, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.  The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner had sexually molested deceased Shobhika, who

is the wife of the 2nd respondent and daughter of the 3rd

respondent herein and had forbade the deceased from

divulging the same to others. It is also alleged that, on

Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                               2

16.3.2000, the petitioner had tried to embrace and kiss the

deceased, which was witnessed by her husband and

thereupon the deceased had mentally broken down and had

committed suicide by hanging to death and thereby the

petitioner/accused had committed the offence as alleged by

the prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, which

is the subject matter of the above case, as per Annexure A3

affidavit executed by the 2nd respondent and Annexure A4

affidavit executed by the 3rd respondent.     Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                                3

         5.      The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, do not intends to proceed any further against

the petitioner and they have no grievance against him.

         6.        I  have carefully considered   the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 306 of

I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved.     It is pertinent to note that

Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                                    4

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.        From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to me

that the parties to the dispute have no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                                   5

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

Crl.M.C.No.5248 of 2014
                                6

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioner in

S.C.No.140 of 2003 of the court of Assistant Sessions Judge

(Addl.), Palakkad, pursuant to Crime No.572 of 2000 of

Palakkad Town South Police Station.

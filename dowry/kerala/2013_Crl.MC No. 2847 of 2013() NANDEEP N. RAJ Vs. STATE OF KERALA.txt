            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. No. 2847 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 11th day of July, 2013

                            ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.279/2011 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Aluva which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 1313/2011 of

Kalamassery Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 323, 427 and 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure A1 FIR dated 2/7/2011, registered by

Kalamasserry Police and Annexure A2, the charge sheet dated

6/7/2011, pending before th Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Aluva, the matter is settled out of court.

         2.      The prosecution case allegation is that on

1/7/2011 at 7.20 p.m., the petitioners herein who were the

members of Democratic Youth Federation of India and

Students Federation of India, being aware of the fact that they

were rendering into an unlawful assembly, used force and

violence and attacked the respondents 2 to 4 who were

members of the Youth Congress and Kerala Students Union

and thereby caused injury to them. The incident happened at

Crl.M.C. No. 2847 of 2013
                                 2

H.M.T Kavala at Kalamasserry and thus it is alleged that the

accused committed the offences punishable under Sections 143,

147, 323, 427 and 149 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioners are

that the matter is settled subsequently with the defacto

complainant, second respondent and the injured, respondents 3 and

4. Second respondent, defacto complainant is sworn into affidavit

Annexure-A3 and Annexures-4 and 5 affidavit are sworn into

respondents 3 and 4, who are injured.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

the second respondent.      I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.      Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received     from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

Crl.M.C. No. 2847 of 2013
                                       3

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.           I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.            In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Sections 143, 147, 323, 427 and 149 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.      It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that the

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the above

Crl.M.C. No. 2847 of 2013
                                         4

          discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

          High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

          and different from the power given to a criminal court for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

          Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

          ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

          any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

          the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

          depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

          no category can be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly

          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

          offences arising from commercial, financial,mercandile,

          civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

          family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

          quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

          compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

          continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

          oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

          caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

          full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

Crl.M.C. No. 2847 of 2013
                                    5

          According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the

event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexures-

A1 and A2           and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.279/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Aluva and all further proceedings thereto.

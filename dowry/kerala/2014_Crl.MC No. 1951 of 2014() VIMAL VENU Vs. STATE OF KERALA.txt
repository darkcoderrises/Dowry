          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 4th day of April, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in S.C.No.128/2013

pending     before            the         Principal              Sessions       Court,

Thiruvananthapuram, to quash the proceedings on the basis

of settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in S.C.No.128/2013

pending     before            the         Principal              Sessions       Court,

Thiruvananthapuram. The case was originated on the basis

of a statement given by the defacto-complainant/ 2nd

respondent herein, as Crime No.999/2010 of Aryanad Police

Station of Thiruvananthapuram District, alleging offences

under Section 341, 506(1) read with Section 34 of the

Crl.M.C. No.1951 of 2014
                                2

Indian Penal Code.       After investigation, final report was

filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Nedumangad. Since the 3rd respondent herein was a child at

the time of incident and he also sustained injuries in the

case and by virtue of the establishment of Principal

Sessions Court as Special Court for trying cases involving

Child and Child Right Act as per Section 25 of the

Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, this

case     was    committed    to  Principal   Sessions   Court,

Thiurvananthapuram, and taken on file as S.C.No.128/2013

and it is pending before that court. Now the matter has

been settled between the parties. The alleged child has

become major now. The petitioners are neighbours and the

matter has been settled between the parties due to the

intervention of mediators and the relationship has been

restored. The child who became major also has no

grievance now. The offences alleged are not that grave in

nature as well. No injury has been caused to any of the

Crl.M.C. No.1951 of 2014
                                   3

victims in the incident.         In view of the settlement, no

purpose will be served by proceeding the case as well.

Since the case is pending before the Sessions Court,

compounding will not be permitted by that court. So they

have no other option, except to approach this court, seeking

the following relief:

            1. Quash Annexure-A, Final Report and all further
      proceedings pending against the petitioners pursuant to
      SC 128/2013 before the Principal Sessions Court,
      Thiruvananthapuram      arising     out    from     Crime
      No.999/2010      of  the    Aryanad     Police     Station,
      Thiruvananthapuram District.

            2. Grant such other relief deemed fit to this Hon'ble
      Court.

            3.    Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through

counsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled

between the parties and they do not want to prosecute the

case due to the mediation settlement on account of the

intervention of well-wishers and family members and the

relationship between them has been restored. They have

filed Annexure-B and C affidavits, stating these facts. The

counsel for the petitioner submitted that, in view of the

Crl.M.C. No.1951 of 2014
                                 4

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and so, they

prayed for allowing the application.

            4.    Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions as

directed by this court, submitted that, except this case

there is no other case against the petitioners, but opposed

the application.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, a crime was

registered as Crime No.999/2010 of Aryanad Police Station

of Thiruvananthapuram District, under Section 341, 506(1)

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, as against

the petitioners. The 3rd respondent was a minor at the time

of incident. He was also present along with the defacto-

complainant at the relevant time. Since both were

wrongfully restrained and alleged to have been threatened,

the crime was registered. After investigation, Annexure-A

final report was filed and it was taken on file by the learned

magistrate originally as C.C.No.540/2012. Later, when the

Crl.M.C. No.1951 of 2014
                              5

Principal Sessions Court has been designated as Special

Court for the trial of the cases involving Child or Child

Rights under Section 25 of the Commission for Protection of

Child Rights Act, 2005, this case was committed to the

Principal Sessions Court, where it was taken on file as

S.C.No.128/2013. Now the child has become major. The

matter has been settled between the parties and they have

filed Annexure-B and C affidavits stating that, due to the

intervention of mediators, the matter has been settled.

Further, except the fact that, they have wrongfully

restrained and threatened, no bodily injury has been

caused, even as per the prosecution case. The petitioners

and the respondents 2 and 3 are neighbours and on account

of the settlement, their relationship has been restored. No

possibility for conviction as well in such cases, as they will

not support the case of the prosecution in view of the

settlement and allowing the prosecution to continue will

only a futile attempt and it will be wastage of judicial time

as well.

            6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed.   However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of
      the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity
      or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.      Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
      the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
      from commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
      the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

Crl.M.C. No.1951 of 2014
                                       7

      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
      and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it would
      be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with
      the criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal
      proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law
      despite settlement and compromise between the victim and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the
      answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
      Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."


            7.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the matter has

been settled between the parties and their old relationship

has been restored on account of the settlement and there is

no possibility of conviction in view of the settlement, this

court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the 'Code' can be invoked to quash the

proceedings, as no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the case and it will be only a wastage of judicial time

and also to promote the settlement that has been arrived at

between the parties and restoration of their original

relationship. So the application is allowed and the further

                                 8

proceedings in S.C. 128/2013 pending before Principal

Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram (Crime No.999/2010

of Aryanad Police Station) against the petitioner is quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary further action in

this matter.

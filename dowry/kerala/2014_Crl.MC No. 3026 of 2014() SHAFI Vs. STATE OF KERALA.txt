                  =================
                 CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014
              =====================
              Dated this the 12th day of June, 2014

                             ORDER
                            ----------

      This is an application filed by the accused persons in

CC.No.918 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court,       No-II, Perinthalmanna to quash the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Melatur police

station in Crime No.171 of 2013 of that police station which

was registered on the basis of the statement given by the

second respondent as defacto complainant alleging offences

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324 and r/w 149 of the Indian

Penal Code. After investigation final report was filed and it was

taken on file as CC.No.918 of 2013 pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, No.II Perinthalmanna.           The

petitioners and the defacto complainant were friends and due

to the intervention of mediators and well wishers, the matters

has been settled between the parties and the defacto

complainant and injured who were shown as respondents 2 to 4

do not want to prosecute the case any longer as their

relationship has been restored. Since some of the offences are

CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014            2

non compoundable in nature, they could not file the application

before the Court below. So they have no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief:-

      To quash Annexure-A and all further proceedings in CC.No.918 of

      2013 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna,


      Malappuram District.

       3.   Respondents 2 to 4 who are the defacto complainant

and the injured in the case appeared through counsel and submitted

that the matter has been settled between the parties and they do

not want to prosecute the petitioenrs who are their friends and the

incident happened due to some misunderstanding and now their

relationship has been restored. They have filed affidavits stating

these facts.

       4.   Counsel for the petitioner also submitted in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and so they prayed

for allowing the application.

       5.   The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case against

the petitioners but opposed the application on the ground that

dangerous weapons were used in the commission of the crime.

       6.   It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent as defacto complainant Crime

No.171 of 2013 of Melatur police station was registered by hat

CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014            3

police officials against the petitioners alleging offences under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 324 and r/w 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

It is also an admitted fact that after investigation, final report was

filed and it is now pending as CC.No.918 of 2013 pending before

the judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Perinthalmanna. It

is alleged in the petition and also the affidavits filed by the

respondents 2 and 4 that they were friends and incident happened

due to some misunderstanding and now the matter has been

settled between them on account of intervention of well wishers of

both parties. On account of the settlement, there is no possibility

of conviction as they will not support the case of the prosecution

even if trial is allowed to continue. Further it cannot be said that it

is a incident of public interest but it is a incident happened between

friends due to some misunderstanding which due to the

intervention of mediators later settled and their relationship has

been restored?

       In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab

[2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion

      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in

      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014              4

     exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

     power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

     abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

     quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

     exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

     dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each

     case and no category can be prescribed.      However, before

     exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard

     to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

     offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

     dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

     victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

     dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have

     serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise

     between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

     under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

     offences committed by public servants while working in that

     capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

     criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the

     criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

     civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of

     quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

     financial,  mercantile,   civil,   partnership or   such   like

     transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating

     to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is

     basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

     resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

     Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

     of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

     possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

     of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

     prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by

     not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014             5

      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding

      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

      settlement   and   compromise      between    the  victim  and

      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer

      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

      be well within its jurisdiction      to quash the criminal

      proceeding."

      7.     In view of the dictum laid on in the above decision and

also considering the fact that it is a dispute due to misunderstanding

between friends that resulted in incident which later settled due to

the intervention of well wishers of both parties and their relationship

has been restored to the original position and                possibility of

conviction in such cases is remote and allowing the case to continue

will only amount to wastage of judicial time, this Court feels that it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Criminal

Procedure Code has to be invoked to quash the proceedings in order

to promote the settlement and restoration of friendship between

the parties and pendency of this case should not be hurdle for the

same.

      So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.918 of 2013 (Crime No.171 of 2013 of Melatur police

station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

CRL.M.C.NO.3026 OF 2014         6

No-II, Perinthalmanna as against the petitioners is quashed.




      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

Court, immediately.

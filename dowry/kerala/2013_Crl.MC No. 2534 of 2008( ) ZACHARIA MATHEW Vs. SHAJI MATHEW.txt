              ---------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.Nos.2534 OF 2008 &
                    2547 & 2548 OF 2011
              ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 29th day of August, 2013.


                            O R D E R


      As common issue arises for consideration in these petitions,

these petitions are being disposed of by a common order.

      2.  The main issue that arises for consideration in these

petitions is whether the compromise entered into between the

brothers, one of them being the de facto complainant and others

accused, can be accepted and the proceedings can be directed to

be closed or quashed as the case may be putting an end to the

entire proceedings as against the respective accused persons.

      3. It is true that on an earlier occasion, by Annexure R2

order produced in Crl.M.C.Nos.2547 and 2548 of 2011, this Court

had occasion to consider the very same plea and it was found

that though the proceedings arose on a private complaint, crimes

alleged to have been committed were in fact against society and

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases    2


it will be a sending of wrong message to accept the compromise.

Accordingly, the earlier petitions filed by the respective parties

were dismissed.

       4. The petitioners, drawing inspiration from the decision in

Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another ((2012) 10

Supreme Court Cases 303), have now filed the petitions pointing

out that the disputes between the parties in the respective cases

have been settled and the amounts due to the respective public

institutions have been paid and the debts discharged. It is also

pointed out that no more disputes survive between the parties to

be settled and that the de facto complainant does not wish to

prosecute the matter further. Under the above circumstances, it

is pointed out that in the light of the above decision, it is only fit,

proper and just that the proceedings herein be given a quietus to

and the parties are relieved of the burden of facing trial and such

other proceedings. It is almost certain that such an exercise will

only be a futile one.

       5. Learned Standing Counsel appearing for the CBI very

vehemently opposed the petitions pointing out that the

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases      3


compromise is between brothers. One of them is the de facto

complainant.         The investigation was taken over by CBI under

orders of this Court on petitions moved by the de facto

complainant and considerable amount of money and time has

been spent by them in the matter. Learned Standing Counsel

also pointed out that it could not be said theoretically that the

disputes are of private nature as the money involved is public

money.        The fact remains that the offences are committed

against the society as such and therefore, the principles laid

down in the decision relied on by the learned counsel for the

petitioners cannot be accepted. Learned Standing Counsel also

pointed out that in view of Annexure R2 order, a reconsideration

of the present orders is necessary.

      6. After having heard the learned counsel for the respective

parties, it is felt that it could not strictly be said that the matter is

not between brothers and it is a public or social issue. No doubt

true that the funds of the public institutions were siphoned off by

the process adopted by the accused persons.               But, the real

sufferer was one of the brothers whose signature etc. are alleged

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases    4


to have been forged. It is also true that it is on the petitions filed

by the de facto complainant that investigation was taken over by

CBI. It could not be disputed that much money and time were

spent by the CBI to find out the so called forgery etc. which gave

rise to the crime now registered against the accused persons.

But the fact remains that the dispute was essentially between

brothers. It is also significant to notice that may be due to the

commendable investigation done by the CBI, public money was

saved and the parties settled the matter and satisfied the debt

due to each of the financial institutions.

      7. It is pointed out that the parties namely, brothers have

settled all their differences and disputes and the de facto

complainant does not wish to proceed with the matter. In the

light of the said stand taken by the de facto complainant, even

though there may be materials against the petitioners now, the

chance of a successful trial is rather weak and in all probabilities,

it will be an exercise in futility especially when the de facto

complainant has shown his disinterest in prosecuting the matter

further.

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases        5


      8.     It will be useful at this point of time to refer to the

relevant portion of the decision in Gian Singh vs. State of

Punjab and another ((2012) 10 Supreme Court Cases 303)

which reads as follows:

                      "61. The position that emerges from the above

              discussion can be summarised thus: the power of

              the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or

              FIR     or complaint in exercise      of its inherent

              jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

              given to a criminal court for compounding the

              offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent

              power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

              limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

              the guideline engrafted in such power viz.:(i) to

              secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of

              the process of any court. In what cases power to

              quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR

              may be exercised where the offender and the victim

              have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

              and circumstances of each case and no category can

              be prescribed.     However, before exercise of such

              power, the High Court must have due regard to the

              nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

              offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,

              rape, dacoity etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even

              though the victim or victim's family and the offender

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases           6


              have settled the dispute.         Such offences are not

              private in nature and have a serious impact on

              society.       Similarly, any compromise between the

              victim and the offender in relation to the offences

              under     special     statutes like the   Prevention  of

              Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

              servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot

              provide for any basis for quashing the criminal

              proceedings involving such offences.           But the

              criminal       cases     having   overwhelmingly    and

              predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different

              footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

              offences        arising   from   commercial,   financial,

              mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions

              or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to

              dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is

              basically private or personal in nature and the parties

              have resolved their entire dispute. In this category

              of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal

              proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

              between the offender and the victim, the possibility

              of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

              the criminal case would put the accused to great

              oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

              would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

              case despite full and complete settlement and

              compromise with the victim.         In other words, the

              High Court must consider whether it would be unfair

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases       7


              or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

              the criminal proceeding or continuation of the

              criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of

              process of law despite settlement and compromise

              between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether

              to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that

              the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

              to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the

              High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

              quash the criminal proceeding".

      9. Going by the principles laid down in the said decision, it

could not strictly be said that the offences made mention of in

the petitions fall within the ambit of prohibited category. True,

public money is certainly involved. But, it is more in the nature

of a dispute between the two brothers and there is no case as of

now that due to the settlement, any loss has been caused to be

financial institution from which money was borrowed on the basis

of the so called objectionable documents.

      10. Since the brothers have chosen to settle the matters

between them, in order to give a quietus to all the issues and to

put an end to the litigations, it is felt that in the light of the

decision referred to above, it will be proper for this Court to

Crl.M.C.No.2534/08 & conn.cases    8


extend reliefs to the parties to enable them to lead a harmonious

and peaceful life. This is not to say that the acts are justified but

only to mention that since the de facto complainant himself has

come forward with showing inclination to put an end to the

disputes and has stated that he is disinterested in pursuing the

matter further, certainly it will be a waste of time and money to

let the proceedings continue.

      11. In the result, all further proceedings in C.C.Nos.36 and

71 of 2008 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam shall

stand quashed and the accused shall stand discharged.

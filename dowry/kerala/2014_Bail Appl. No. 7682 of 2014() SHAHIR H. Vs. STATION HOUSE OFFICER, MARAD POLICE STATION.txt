                  ---------------------------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of October, 2014


                              ORDER

      Petitioners are accused Nos.1 & 2 in Crime No.395 of

2014 of Marad Police Station, Kozhikode district registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 406 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.     The de facto complainant, is the wife of the first

petitioner. The second petitioner herein is the mother of the

first petitioner.

      3.     The gist of the allegation is that after the marriage

between the de facto complainant and the first petitioner, the

petitioners had inflicted mental and physical cruelty on her and

demanded more dowry and dis-appropriated her property, gold

ornaments and money.

      4.     Smt.K.Meera, the learned counsel for the petitioners

submits that the petitioners are innocent and the allegations

are falsely implicated on them merely due to differences of

opinion in the matrimonial home. The prayer raised by the

learned counsel for the petitioners is that, the pre-arrest bail

may be allowed in this case and that the petitioners are

B.A.NO.7682 of 2014
                                   2

prepared to comply with any conditions that are found

necessary by this Court in order to protect the interest of the

prosecution.

      5.    The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions

submitted the details of the registration of the instant crime

and about the offences involved and also submitted that crime

has been registered on the first information lodged by the lady

de facto complainant, who is the wife of the first petitioner and

the daughter-in-law of the second petitioner. The learned Public

Prosecutor would further submits that in case this Court is

inclined to grant pre-arrest bail, then the same may be

restricted with necessary conditions and safeguards to protect

the bonafide interest of the prosecution.

      6.    Having heard the submissions of the              learned

counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor

and on valuation of the facts and circumstances of the case,

this Court is inclined to allow the plea of pre-arrest bail in this

case such order necessarily safeguards to protect the bonafide

interest of the prosecution.

      7.    Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of the arrest

of the petitioners herein in connection with the above said crime,

they shall be released on bail on their executing a bond for Rs.

                                        3

35,000/- (rupees thirty five thousand only) each with two solvent

sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the

investigating officer in the above crime and subject to the

following conditions:

(i)      The petitioners shall surrender their passport, if any, before the
         jurisdictional Magistrate concerned within 3 days from the
         execution of the bail bond before the Investigating Officer and if
         they are not holder of passport, then they shall file an affidavit to
         that effect in the said court. If the petitioners require their passport
         in connection with their travel abroad, then they are free to
         approach the court below concerned for the release of the same
         and for necessary permission in that regard. In case such an
         application is filed, the trial court or the jurisdictional Magistrate
         concerned, as the case may be, is free to consider the same on
         merits and to pass appropriate orders thereon, taking necessary
         guidance from the principles laid down in the decision of this
         Court in the case Asok Kumar v. State of Kerala, reported in 2009
         (2) KLT 712, notwithstanding the aforementioned conditions
         imposed by this Court.

(ii)     The petitioners shall not involve in any criminal offence of similar
         nature or graver in nature.

(iii)    The petitioners shall co-operate with the investigation and report
         before the investigating officer as and when required.

(iv)     The petitioners shall not influence the witnesses or shall not
         tamper or attempt to tamper evidence in any manner whatsoever.
       If the petitioners violate any of the conditions as ordered
above, then the bail granted to them is liable to be cancelled.

      With the above said directions, this Bail Application stands

finally disposed of.

                     B.A. No.7712 of 2013
              ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 8th day of January, 2014.

                            O R D E R

      The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.815 of

2013 of Varkala Police Station, who is alleged to have

committed offence punishable under Section 304(B) read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. The wife of the petitioner, namely Lisha Ravi Raj, aged

33 at the relevant time committed suicide by hanging on

03.10.2013 at about 4 pm. The couple have a child aged 2 =

years.

      3. The allegation is that the petitioner and the members

of his family used to ill-treat the victim complaining about lack

of beauty and demanding more dowry. Unable to bear the

torture any more, it is alleged that she had committed suicide.

      4. The petitioner would point out that the allegations are

totally false and cooked up for the purpose of the case. The

petitioner drew the attention of this Court to the First

Information Statement, which is furnished by the father-in-law

of the petitioner in which there is no allegation about the

harassment or cruelty or ill-treatment demanding more dowry.

B.A. No.7712 of 2013             2


It come much later. The petitioner would say that in fact on

most of the occasions the victim was staying with her father

and it is inconceivable, if as a matter of fact there was ill-

treatment on the victim by the petitioner as now alleged, that

the father has no information about it and he has not

mentioned it at the time of furnishing the First Information

Statement. The subsequent statement of harassment is clearly

an afterthought and with oblique motive.

      5. The complainant has been impleaded as the 2nd

respondent and he has entered appearance through a counsel

and filed a Counter Affidavit asserting what he has stated in

the complaint subsequently given.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition and

pointed out that the allegations are of serious nature.

      7. After having     heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner, the learned counsel for the second respondent and

the learned Public Prosecutor and also after having perused the

records, though it may not be possible to say that the

allegations are totally false, there is some substance in the

grievance raised by the petitioner. One cannot omit to notice

that the marriage was on 19.04.2010 and the death of the

B.A. No.7712 of 2013                  3


victim was on 03.10.2013. The marriage subsisted for three

years. If as a matter of fact, there was ill-treatment

demanding more dowry or any other harassment as now

claimed by the 2nd respondent, surely he would have known

about it, because during the three years, on most of the

occasions the victim was staying with the 2nd respondent in his

house. A deeper probe into the veracity of the allegations is

not warranted at this point of time.

      8. Considering the nature of allegations against the

petitioner and the various circumstances brought out by the

petitioner, it is felt that it is a fit case where the extraordinary

jurisdiction of this Court needs to be exercised in favour of the

petitioner.

      Therefore, this application is allowed on the following

conditions:

      i)     The    petitioner     shall   surrender   before    the

             Investigating Officer on or before 15.01.2014 who,

             after interrogation, shall produce him before the

             Court concerned, which court, on application for bail

             being moved by the petitioner, shall release him on

             bail on his executing bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/-

             (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only) with two

B.A. No.7712 of 2013               4


             solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

             satisfaction of the Court concerned.

      ii)    The Court concerned shall ensure the identity of the

             sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts

             produced by them.

      iii)   The petitioner shall report before the Investigating

             Officer on every Wednesday between 9 a.m and

             10 a.m until further orders.

      iv)    The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to

             tamper with the evidence or influence or try to

             influence the witness.

      v)     If any of the conditions is violated, the bail granted

             to the petitioner shall stand cancelled and the Court

             concerned, on being satisfied of the said fact, may

             take such steps as are available to it in law.

            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. No. 2072 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 24th day of June, 2013

                             ORDER

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482

of Cr.P.C by the sole accused against whom L.P.No.59/2008 is

pending in the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam.

and this petition is filed with a prayer to quash all proceedings

pending against him as the matter is settled out of court.

                 2.    In fact L.P.No.59/2008 was originated

from Crime No.261/2003 Kundara Police Station wherein the

allegation is that the accused Nos.1 and 2 had partnership firm

at  Perumbuzhacherry       and    on  30/4/2000    the   accused

approached CW1, who is the defacto complainant and the first

respondent in the above M.C., and induced her to deposit

amount in the firm as fixed deposit, assuring her that the

amount would be returned later with interest at 15% per

annum. Thus according to the prosecution he deposited a sum

of Rs.1 lakh on 30/4/2000 for a period of 2 years, which was

matured on 30/4/2002 but no amount was given as undertaken

by the petitioners and therefore they have committed the

Crl.M.C. No. 2072 of 2013
                                 2

offence punishable under Section 420 and r/w Section 34 of

IPC.

             3.   The police on completing the investigation in

the above crime preferred a report based upon which

cognizance was taken against the accused and instituted as

C.C.No.1391/2003. Trial in the above case was proceeded

against the second accused alone as the petitioner, who is the

first accused was not available, which resulted in the judgment

dated 18/8/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kollam, convicting the accused who faced the prosecution.

Against the said conviction and sentence, the said accused has

filed an appeal as Criminal Appeal No.562/2007, which was

disposed by the learned Judge of the Court of Additional

Sessions Judge, Kollam as per Annexure-2 judgment whereby

the said accused is acquitted. On the above set of facts the

prayer of the petitioner is that he also may be exonerated from

all the proceedings pending against him particularly on the

strength of the Annexure-2 judgment of the Lower Appellate

Court as well as in the light of the Compounding Petition,

Crl.M.A.4285/2013 filed before this Court.

             4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

Crl.M.C. No. 2072 of 2013
                                    3

the counsel appearing for the first respondent.

         5.          It is crystal clear that the disputes between

the present petitioner, who is the first accused in the above

crime is settled out of court as evident by the affidavit filed by

the first respondent defacto complainant and in the light of the

Crl.M.A.No.4285/2013. It is also relevant to note that as per

Annexure-2 judgment, the lower appellate court has already

recorded the amicable settlement arrived into between the

second accused and defacto complainant. If that be so,

according to me, the continuation of the proceedings against

the petitioner is resulted in abuse of process of Court.

 In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-

               "57. The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR

         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

         distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under

         S.320 of the Code.      Inherent power is of wide

         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

         exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in

Crl.M.C. No. 2072 of 2013
                                       4

         such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)

         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In

         what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or

         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the

         offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case

         and no category can be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But     the     criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences arising out of

          matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and

          bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

          settlement and compromise with the victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

Crl.M.C. No. 2072 of 2013
                                 5

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled

the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be

sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court

and proceedings.         Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -I and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in L.P.No.59/2008 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kollam and all further proceedings thereto.

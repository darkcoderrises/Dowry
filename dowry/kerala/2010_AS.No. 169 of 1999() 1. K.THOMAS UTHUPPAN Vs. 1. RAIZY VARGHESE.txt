    This  appeal      is     preferred        against  the

judgment and decree passed by the Subordinate

Judge, Pathanamthita in O.S.133/92.            The suit is

one for realisation of the amount due to the

plaintiff from the defendants.               The plaintiff

was married by the 2nd defendant and at the time

of fixation of the marriage it is contended that

Rs.50,000/- was granted as the paternal share

and subsequently at the time of the marriage 7

sovereigns of gold were given out of which 4

sovereigns  has    been      misappropriated       by  the

husband.  It is also contended that a divorce

proceedings is pending as O.P.24/91.

    2.  On the other hand the defendants would

contend that no amount has been entrusted to the

A.S. 169 OF 1999
                          -2-

first defendant and no amount was received and

that the 2nd defendant has not misappropriated

any gold ornaments and further that the petition

filed     by    the wife  for  divorce  has   been

dismissed.

      3.   In this case PWs.1 to 3 and DWs.1 and 2

were    examined   and Ext.B1  was  marked.    The

Independent evidence available in the matter is

that of PW2 and PW3. One of these witnesses is a

Parishioner      who  has   participated  in   the

engagement and it is strongly contended that

since the engagement register maintained by the

Church does not contain these particulars it has

to be stated that no such amount has been given.

But the witness had deposed that after the

introduction of Dowry Prohibition Act, at the

time of engagement no such endorsements were

made and therefore absence of an entry in Ext.B1

A.S. 169 OF 1999
                           -3-

does not militate against the plaintiff.    Father

of the plaintiff also was examined and he had

clearly deposed that the engagement was done at

their residence and it was from the engagement

room the amount was given and received by the

father     of   the   2nd defendant  namely  first

defendant.      The Court below on an analysis of

the materials found that it appears to be the

correct      version  and   the  evidence  of  the

defendants are not acceptable.       It has to be

remembered that it is only a customary practice

among the Christians in Kerala to give such

amount at the time of engagement or at the time

of    marriage    and  there  cannot  be  an entry

regarding all these things.        It is also the

evidence of one of the witnesses that he had

participated in the engagement ceremony and had

advanced      Rs.25,000/- to  the   father of  the

A.S. 169 OF 1999
                           -4-

plaintiff for the purpose of making Rs.50,000/-

and therefore his evidence also goes in support

of the contention of the plaintiff.       So I find

that the Court below has analyzed the evidence

in the correct perspective and had arrived at a

decision and granted a decree in favour of the

plaintiff.       I   do not   find   any  ground to

interfere with the said decision and therefore

the appeal lacks merit and the same is dismissed

but without costs.

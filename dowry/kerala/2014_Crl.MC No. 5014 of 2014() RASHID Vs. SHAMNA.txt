                 ..........................................................
                       Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014
                 .........................................................
             Dated this the 1st day of September, 2014.


                                    O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner who is the accused in                S.C. No. 473/2014 on the file of

the IV Addl. Sessions Court, Kozhikode which was a case instituted

upon a police report in Crime No. 230/2013 of Koduvally Police

Station for offences punishable under Sections 354 and 511 of Sec.

376 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in the above Case,                     as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that the de facto

complainant and the accused were in love while they were doing

their   plus two course.           When the marriage of                     the de facto

complainant was to be fixed, she requested the accused to marry

her. But he told her his inability to maintain her. Therefore, the

Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014

                                :-2-:

de facto complainant got married with one Rasheed. Thereafter

also their relationship continued.    Her husband somehow came to

know about the illegal relationship, he divorced her on 1-2-2013.

On 25-5-2013, the petitioner took the girl on his motor bike to her

house and from there he caught hold of her, pushed her and made

her to lie on a bed and committed rape on her.      Now, the case of

the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of Court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the first   respondent/de facto complainant. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.            Therefore, continuation of the

proceedings in the above case        is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from her, submitted that the

above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend

Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014

                                :-3-:

to proceed any further against the petitioner       and she has no

grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition. In the given facts and

circumstances of the case,     and especially,   in the light of the

settlement arrived      at between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case

are only under Sections 354 and 511 of 376 of IPC which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for

the first respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014

                                      :-4-:

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57.     The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
          in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
          from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
          offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
          of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal
          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
          offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
          the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
          be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
          commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
          criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014

                                   :-5-:

         between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
         remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
         would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

         8.    According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid down in the above decision is applicable in the present

case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decision cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

Crl.M.C.No. 5014 of 2014

                                   :-6-:

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed,        all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in S.C. No.

473/2014 on the file of the IV Addl. Sessions Court, Kozhikode

are quashed.                  .

      Dated this the 1st day of September,2014.

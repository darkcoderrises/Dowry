     ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014
     ==============================
          Dated this, the 03rd day of April, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1 to 4 in

C.C.No.577/13 pending before Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,

Kasargod to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C.No.577/13 pending

before Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasargod. Annexure-

A1 crime was registered on the basis of the statement given by

second respondent as Crime No.372/13 of Vidyanagar Police

station against the petitioners and others alleging offences

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 506(ii) read with

Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.           After investigation,

Annexure-A2 final report was filed only against the present

petitioners for the offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 506

(ii) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and it was taken

on file as C.C.No.577/13 by the learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Kasargod and it is pending before that court. In

Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014      :   2 :

the meantime, the matter has been settled between the parties

due to the intervention of mediators.           In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction. Since some of

the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

file applications for compounding before the court below. So,

they have no other option except to approach this court

seeking the following relief.

            "To quash Annexure-A2 final report and all further

      proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.372/2013 of

      Vidyanagar police station, which is now pending as

      C.C.No.577/2013 on the file of the Learned Chief Judicial

      Magistrate's Court, Kasargod as against the petitioners,

      so as to secure the ends of justice."

      3.     Respondents 2 and 3 who are the de facto

complainant and other injured in the case appeared through

Counsel and submitted that, the petitioners and respondents 2

and 3 were friends and due to some misunderstanding the

incident happened and they have settled the dispute now due

to the intervention of mediators and family members and their

friendship has been restored on account of the settlement and

they do not want the prosecute the petitioners. They also filed

Annexure 3 and 4 affidavits sating these facts. The Counsel for

the petitioners also submitted that in view of the settlement

Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014     :  3 :

possibility of conviction is remote and so they prayed for

allowing the application.

      4.     The learned public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioners and they have no criminal background

but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the first respondent as de facto

complainant, Annexure A1 First Information Report was

registered as Crime No.372/13 of Vidyanagar Police Station

originally alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

323, 324, 506(ii) read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code

against the six named persons and other identifiable persons.

After investigation, Annexure A2 final report was filed against

the present petitioners alone for the offences under Sections

341, 323, 324, 506(ii) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code along and the case was taken on file as C.C.N.577/13

and pending before Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasargod.

It is seen from Annexure A3 and A4 affidavits filed by

respondents 2 and 3 that petitioners and respondents 2 and 3

were     friends     and incident  happened   due    to  some

Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014        :  4 :

misunderstanding between them and due to the intervention of

mediators and family members of both the parties, they have

resolved their dispute and their friendship has been restored on

account of the settlement and they do not want to prosecute

the the petitioners. In view of the settlement, the possibility of

conviction is remote as even if the prosecution is allowed to

continue, they will not support the case of the prosecution and

this will amount to only wastage of judicial time.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or
      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and

Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014         :  5 :

      have serious impact on society.             Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the decision cited

(supra), and also considering the fact that the incident

occurred due to some misunderstanding between friends and

that has been settled between the parties and on account of

the settlement, the friendship has been restored and possibility

Crl.M.C.No.1820 of 2014     :  6 :

of conviction is remote in view the settlement, this court feels

that it is a fit case were the power under section 482 of Code

of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote the restoration and friendship between

the parties due to the settlement and the pendency of this case

should not be a hurdle for their friendship.

      So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.577/13 (Crime No.372/13 of Vidyanagar Police Station)

pending before Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasargod as

against the petitioners is quashed.       Office is directed to

communicate this order to the concerned court immediately.

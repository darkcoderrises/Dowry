                   Crl. M.C. No.3850 OF 2012
               ---------------------------------------
          Dated this the 10th day of January, 2013.


                             O R D E R


      The petitioners are seeking to quash the proceedings in

C.C.No.91/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court_II, Haripad. Annexure-A1 is the final report in the said

case. The offences alleged are under Sections 406, 420, 498A

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 4 and 5

of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

      2. The 1st petitioner and the 3rd respondent are husband

and wife, 2nd petitioner is the mother of the 1st petitioner, 3rd and

4th petitioners are the sisters of the 1st petitioner and the

petitioners 5 to 8 are the relatives of the 1st petitioner. The

marriage between the 1st petitioner and the 3rd respondent was

held on 07.06.2009.       It appears that the parties fell apart

thereafter. The 1st petitioner is a Doctor by profession and there

is no issue in the wedlock. It is stated that all the disputes have

been settled between the parties. Annexure-A2 is a copy of the

agreement dated 31.10.2011 and the respondents 2 and 3 have

Crl.M.C.No.3850/2012             2


also filed affidavits as per Annexures-A3 and A4.           The 1st

petitioner and the 3rd respondent filed a joint petition for divorce

on mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act

and the same has been allowed by the court.

      3. Heard both sides and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is

evident from the pleadings that the parties have been settled

their disputes and the respondents 2 and 3 have stated in their

affidavits that they do not want to proceed with the criminal case.

In a matter like this where a case arose purely out of a private

dispute between the parties, this Court will be justified in

exercising the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Now that all the

disputes have been settled and the parties have divorced

themselves, there will not be any purpose in proceeding with the

criminal case also.

      The       Crl.M.C is allowed   and   the    proceedings     in

C.C.No.91/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Haripad will stand quashed.

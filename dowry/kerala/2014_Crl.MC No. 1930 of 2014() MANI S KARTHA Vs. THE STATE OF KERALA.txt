    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 02nd day of April, 2014.




                          O R D E R

      This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No.737/07 of Peroorkada Police

Station to quash the proceedings in view of the settlement

arrived at between the petitioners and the de facto complainant

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

working as Software Engineers under the 4th respondent

Company during 2006-07. While so, due to some differences

of opinion among the petitioners and 4th respondent Company,

the 4th respondent filed a private complaint before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate No-II, Trivandrum against the petitioners

alleging commission of offences under Sections 379, 120(B),

406, 420 and Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 43,

65 and 72 of the Information Technology Act. Now, the entire

matter between them has been settled and Annexure-B

agreement was entered into whereby they have decided to

settle all issues between them and also to withdraw the

criminal cases pending against them. On the basis of the

Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014        :  2 :

complaint given by the second petitioner, another crime was

registered as Crime No.259/08 of Peroorkada Police Station

against the 4th respondent and its Directors and that was also

allowed to be withdrawn for which purpose Crl.M.C.No.1931/14

was filed. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility for

conviction and no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the investigation as well. It is purely a civil dispute regarding

copy right of a software created. Since it is in the crime stage,

neither the court, nor the investigating officer will drop the

further proceedings. So, They have no other option to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

            "To call for the records leading to Annexure A FIR

      in Crime No.723/2007 of Peroorkada Police Station,

      Thiruvananthapuram and quash the same."

       3.    Fourth respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and they do not want to prosecute the case. They have

entered into Annexure B agreement in respect of all disputes.

The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of

the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction even if

ultimately final report was filed and it is purely a civil dispute

which has been settled between them.

Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014    :  3 :

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, except this case, there is

no other case but, opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

private complaint filed by the fourth respondent against the

petitioners before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II

Trivandrum,       which was   forwarded   to   the   police  for

investigation under Section 156(3) of Code of Criminal

Procedure on the basis of which Annexure A First Information

Report was registered as Crime No.723/07 of Peroorkada

Police Station against the petitioners alleging offences under

Sections 379, 120(B), 406, 420 read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code and Sections 43, 65 and 72 of Information

Technology Act. The investigation is still in progress. In the

meantime, the petitioners have settled their disputes with the

4th respondent Company evidenced by Annexure B agreement.

On going through the allegations in the complaint and also

Annexure-B agreement, it is seen that the cases were

registered on the basis of some dispute regarding the

ownership of some software created while the petitioners were

working under the 4th respondent Company. Now, the matter

Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014        :  4 :

has been settled between the parties.                There was an

arbitration case also filed in respect of the same dispute which

was also agreed to be withdrawn as per the agreement. So,

considering all these aspects, it cannot be said to be a crime

affecting the public interest as such but, purely a civil dispute

in respect of copy right regarding the software created, which

later settled between the parties by entering into Annexure B

agreement. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility

for conviction even if final report is ultimately filed and it was

allowed to proceed with the trial.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and

Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014         :  5 :

      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have   serious    impact on    society.     Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and considering the fact that a copy right dispute in

Crl.M.C.No.1930 of 2014     : 6 :

respect of software which resulted in registering of crimes by

both parties having been settled due to the intervention of well

wishers of both sides and no possibility of conviction being

entered into even if ultimately final report is filed in the

matter, this court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings.

      In the result, the petition is allowed and further

proceedings in Crime No.737/07 of Peroorkada Police Station

against the petitioners is hereby quashed. Office is directed to

communicate this order to the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court. No-II, Trivandrum to be informed to the concerned

police station for necessary further action in this regard.

                       B.A. No. 4257 of 2014

               ----------------------------------------------

             Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014


                                 ORDER

      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      Petitioners are accused in Crime No. 276/2014 of

Vellarikundu Police Station. The de facto-complainant is the first

petitioner's wife. The other petitioners are her parents-in-law.

The petitioners are alleged to have subjected her to cruelty

physical and mental demanding more dowry and threatened her.

They are thus alleged to have committed the offences under

Sections 323, 498(A) and 506 I.P.C.

      2. Heard.

      3.  The first petitioner is the husband of the de facto-

complainant and the other petitioners are his parents.           The

marriage between the de facto-complainant and the first

petitioner was solemnized in November 2012. The prosecution

has no case that the petitioners committed any act of serious

physical violence to the de facto-complainant. It appears that

reconciliation is not impossible. If the petitioners happen to be

detained, reunion may become impossible. So I am inclined to

grant their prayer.

       In the result, this application is allowed.

                 with two solvent sureties each for the like sum

                 if they are arrested by the Police in connection

                 with this case.

        2.      They shall appear before the Investigating

                 Officer for interrogation if they are so

                 required by him in writing.

        3.       They shall not destroy or tamper with

                 evidence.

        4.       They shall not harass the defacto-complainant

                 or her relatives.

        5.       This order is not applicable if the petitioners

                 choose to surrender before the Magistrate

                 concerned and in such case the learned

                 Magistrate may take appropriate action in

                 accordance with the law.

            Dated this the     day of February, 2013

                            JUDGMENT
P.D.Rajan,J.

      Appellants are respondents 1 and 2 in O.P.No.118/2006 of

the Family Court, Kottarakkara and the respondent is the

petitioner in the above O.P., which was filed for realising Rs.2

lakhs and 101 sovereigns of gold or its market value at the rate

of Rs.5,93,880/-. The lower court decreed the suit in part and

aggrieved by that order, the appellants preferred this appeal.

The brief facts are as follows:

      2.   On 6.12.2004,      the first   appellant   married the

respondent at Panikkath Auditorium as per hindu religious rites

and both of them resided together at their matrimonial house. At

the time of marriage, 101 sovereigns of gold ornaments were

given to the respondent and Rs.2 lakhs entrusted with the 2nd

appellant. The gold ornaments were subsequently entrusted to

the 1st appellant's mother. They were misappropriated without

Mat Appeal No.14/2008              2

the knowledge and consent of the respondent and they

purchased a vehicle in the name of the 2nd appellant's name.

While residing together, the 1st appellant demanded more

amount as dowry and ill-treated the respondent both mentally

and physically.      Their relationship became strained and the

respondent was evicted from her matrimonial home and the

mediation and settlement were also failed.        In the above

circumstances, the respondent approached the court below for

getting gold and money.

     3.     In the court below, the respondent's husband (1st

appellant) denied the above facts, inter alia he contended that

the respondent gave only 54 sovereigns of gold ornaments at

the time of marriage and also gave 6 sovereigns of gold as

chain and ring and total gold ornaments worth only 60

sovereigns. On 23.11.2005 at 4.30 p.m., the respondent left

her matrimonial home with 30 sovereigns and on 21.11.2004,

the amount of Rs.2 lakhs agreed, was not given to the

appellants. There is no misappropriation of gold ornaments

and the purchase of the vehicle was with his money.         All

Mat Appeal No.14/2008            3

properties of the parents of the respondent were sold earlier

and this petition was filed only to extract money from the

appellants.

     4.     Both     parties adduced  oral  and   documentary

evidence in the court below.       The respondent's evidence

consists of PW1 to PW4 and Exts.A1 to A4.           Appellants'

evidence consists of the oral testimony of CPW1 to CPW4 and

Exts.B1 to B3.       The learned lower court, after sifting and

weighing the evidence on record, decreed the suit in part

directing the appellants to return 2 lakh rupees and 556.490

grams of gold ornaments to the respondent within two months

from that day, failing which the respondent can realise its

value of Rs.4,08,267/- from the appellants and their assets.

Aggrieved by that, the appellants preferred this appeal.

     5.     The learned counsel appearing for the appellants

contended that the lower court has not properly appreciated

the evidence on record and without considering the legal

principles the case was decreed.       No evidence has been

adduced by the respondent to substantiate her pleadings. The

Mat Appeal No.14/2008             4

respondent has failed to prove that she gave 101 sovereigns of

gold ornaments at the time of marriage. Ext.A1, photograph is

not sufficient to prove her claim. Ext.A1 shows that the gold

ornaments are not more than 54 sovereigns. The evidence of

PW1 is inconsistent with the evidence of PW2. Exts.B1 to B3

are sufficient to prove the contention advanced by the

appellant. In the absence of specific evidence regarding the

claim, the appellants pray to set aside the lower court order.

     6.     The learned counsel appearing for the respondent

strongly resisted the above contention and contended that the

evidence of PW1 to PW4 and Exts.A1 to A4 are sufficient to

prove the case.      The lower court considered all the legal

principles and the suit was decreed on the basis of evidence.

No reasons are highlighted by the appellants to interfere with

the impugned order of the lower court.

     7.     In the light of the above arguments, the only point

arises for consideration is as to whether the respondent has

proved that she gave 101 sovereigns of gold ornaments and

Rs.2 lakhs at the time of marriage and if so, the judgment and

Mat Appeal No.14/2008            5

decree passed by the lower court is sustainable in law.

      8.    There is no dispute regarding the marriage between

the 1st appellant and the respondent, which was solemnised on

6-12-2004 at Painkkath Auditorium, Bharanikkavu as per

hindu religious rites.    The specific case of the respondent

(petitioner in the lower court) was that, at the time of her

marriage, 101 sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs. 2 lakhs

were given to the appellants. To substantiate that contention,

she was examined as PW1 in the lower court and in cross

examination nothing has been brought out by the appellants to

discredit the respondent's evidence, which was supported by

PW2 to PW4. She also produced Exts.A1 to A4 in the court

below to prove the marriage and the quantity of gold

ornaments at the time of marriage. But, the appellants totally

denied the above contention and examined CPW1 to CPW4.

      9.    We are not reiterating the oral testimony of PWs 1

to 4. It is clear from the evidence of PW1 that she purchased

the gold ornaments from Puthoor Pranavam Jewellery. At the

time of her sister's marriage 80 sovereigns of gold were given

Mat Appeal No.14/2008            6

by her parents and she is ready and willing to bring the

photographs. PW1 and her family are living upon the income

derived from agriculture including rubber plantation, but, she

is unable to calculate the actual income derived from it. Even

after detailed cross examination, nothing has been brought out

to discredit the evidence of PW1.     But, at the time of cross

examination of CPW1, he admitted that he gave 101

sovereigns of gold ornaments at the time of his sister's

marriage. He admitted this status of his family at the time of

marriage equal to that of PW1(      


             status         category             .)        This

presume that when a marriage is solemnized by the parties

belonging to equal status, they will maintain the dignity of the

family at the time of marriage. This amounts to an implied

admission made by the appellants with regard to the money

and family status at the time of marriage and this admission is

the best evidence against the appellants. What is admitted by

the appellants to be true must be presumed to true unless the

contrary is shown. Even though CPws 1 to 4 are examined in

Mat Appeal No.14/2008           7

the court below, we are of the opinion that the evidence of

CPW1 and CPW2 are inconsistent about the quantity of gold.

The admission made by the appellants at the time of cross

examination can be used as evidence against them when

strengthens and makes the respondent's case more probable.

      10. The facts tendered by the witnesses were analysed

by the learned Family Court and there is legal reason to reject

the portion of the claim of PW1 in the absence of documentary

evidence to prove the quantity of gold. The mere admission of

a fact made by a party at the time of cross examination is a

good proof against him.        The evidence given by him

throughout his cross examination must be appreciated as a

whole and certain portions of it cannot be appreciated

unconnected with other part of his statement. What he had

stated spontaneously cannot be split up as stated by the

counsel appearing for the appellants. No other reasons are

highlighted before us to conclude that the lower court erred in

appreciating the evidence.

      11. Therefore, the decree and judgment passed by the

Mat Appeal No.14/2008            8

lower court are only to be confirmed.

     In the result, the finding of the lower court is confirmed.

We do not find any merit in this appeal and accordingly, the

same is dismissed.

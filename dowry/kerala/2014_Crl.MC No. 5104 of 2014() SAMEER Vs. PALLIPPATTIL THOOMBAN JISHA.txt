                   -----------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014
                 ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of October, 2014.

                            O R D E R



      The petitioner is the 5th accused in Crime No.185/2009 of

Kottakkal Police Station registered for offence under Secs.143,

147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 506(1) and 452 r/w 149 IPC. The

impugned Annexure-A1 Final Report in the above said Crime

was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Malappuram and that the case has been numbered as

C.C.No.704/2009.      All the other accused faced trial and

acquitted as per the impugned Annexure-A2 judgment. Since

the petitioner was not in station in connection with his job, the

case against him was renumbered as C.C.No.40/2012 and it

was transferred to long pending list as L.P.No.106/2013 on the

file of the above said court, it is averred. It is stated that the

matter has now been amicably settled between the petitioner

and the respondents 1 to 7, who are the defacto complainants

in this case. Respondents 1 to 7 have filed affidavits as per

Annexure-A3 to A10 produced in this Crl.M.C stating the above

aspect of settlement of disputes. In the said facts, it is stated

                                ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

that the subject matter of the case has been amicably settled

between the accused and the contesting respondents at the

intervention of the mediators and that they have no grievance

or complaint against the petitioner and they are not interested

to press the prosecution and that they have no objection in

termination of the impugned criminal proceedings pending as

L.P.No.106/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Malappuram.        It is in the background of

these facts and circumstances, the instant Crl.M.C has been

filed to quash the impugned Annexure-A1 Final Report/Charge

Sheet filed in the impugned Crime No.185/2009 of Kottakkal

Police Station and all further proceedings arising therefrom in

the interest of justice.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.Jacob

Simon, Advocate, has taken notice for the respondent Nos.1 to

7 and the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 8th

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard     Sri.P.Rajesh    Kottakkal, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner, Sri.Jacob Simon, learned counsel

appearing for the respondent Nos.1 to 7 and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 8th respondent.

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between

the parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both

parties as the real disputants to the controversy have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money     and    would   unnecessarily    strain  the   judicial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.Jacob Simon, learned counsel appearing for

respondent Nos.1 to 7 has submitted on the basis of the

specific instructions furnished by the respondent Nos.1 to 7

that the respondent Nos.1 to 7 have amicably settled the

disputes with the petitioner and that they have no objection in

the quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that

the complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner as they have no grievance

against    them    and   that    they  will    not  raise   any

dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondent

Nos.1    to   7,   it is   clear    to   the   Court   that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.

      8.   In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

                                   ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

            "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

                               ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5104 Of 2014

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-A1 Final Report in Crime No.185/2009 of Kottakkal

Police Station which is now pending against the petitioner in

L.P.No.106/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Malappuram and all further proceedings

arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioner shall produce

certified copies of this order before the Station House Officer

concerned    as    well  as  before   jurisdictional Magistrate

concerned.



                                         ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                   Judge.

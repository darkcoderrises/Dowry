              ============================
                      B.A. No.1131 of 2015
             =============================
             Dated this the 11th day of March, 2015

                           O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2. The petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.66 of

2015 of the New Mahe Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A, 406 and 506 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3. The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is his wife, and treated her with cruelty by

demanding     more    dowry     and    gold  ornaments,  after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor.

     5. It seems that serious allegations are levelled against

the petitioner. At the same time, it seems that it is a

matrimonial dispute. On more than one occasions, it seems

that differences of opinion between the petitioner and the

B.A. No.1131 of 2015             2

defacto complainant were sorted out and they reunited.

Considering the possibility of a reunion or the settlement in

the matter, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      6. In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his executing

a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only)

with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to the

following terms and conditions:-

           (i)   The petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00 a.m. on all Wednesdays and Saturdays

     commencing from 18.03.2015 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.

           (ii) The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

B.A. No.1131 of 2015            3

            (iii) The  petitioner     shall   make    himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

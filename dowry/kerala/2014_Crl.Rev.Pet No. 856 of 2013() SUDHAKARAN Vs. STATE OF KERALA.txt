                          V.K.MOHANAN, J
                 ===========================
                        Crl.R.P No.856 of 2013
                ============================
                Dated this the 28th day of August, 2014

                                ORDER


      The above petition is directed against the judgment dated

16.01.2013 in Crl.Appeal No.589/2011 of the Sessions Court,

Kozhikode, which filed against the judgment dated 02.08.2011 in C.C

No.122/2008 of the Court of Judicial First Class Magistrate, Koyilandy

by which the petitioners who are accused found guilty and convicted

for the offences under Sections 354, 406, 506(i) and 498A r/w Section

34 of Indian Penal Code.

      2. During the pendency of the above petition, according to the

learned counsel for the revision petitioners as well as the additional

second respondent, the entire dispute between the petitioners and the

de facto complainant, who is the additional 2nd respondent, are settled

and the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners and therefore, the counsel for the respondent as well as the

additional 2nd respondent submits that after setting aside the judgment

Crl.R.P No.856 of 2013
                                     2



of the trial court as well as the lower appellate court the petitioners may

be acquitted.

       3.   I have carefully considered the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the additional 2nd

respondent and I have gone through the Annexure R2(a) copy of the

agreement entered into between the 1st revision petitioner and the

de facto complainant and also Annexure R2(b) affidavit filed by the

de facto complainant.

       4. The prosecution allegation is that the marriage between the

first revision petitioner and the additional 2nd respondent was

solomnized on 17.04.2006 as per the religious rites and while the

de facto complainant was residing in her matrimonial home, the

accused, in furtherance of their intention physically and mentally

tortured her for getting dowry and also threatened her to kill for the

said purpose. According to the allegation, the 2nd accused outraged her

modesty and the 1st accused misappropriated the gold ornaments. Thus,

according to the prosecution, the accused has committed the offences

Crl.R.P No.856 of 2013
                                    3



punishable under Sections 354, 406, 506(i) and 498A r/w Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.

       5.    On the above allegation, trial was proceeded in C.C

No.122/2008 in the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Koyilandy

during which PWs 1 to 13 were examined and Exts.P1 to P7 were

marked. The trial court found that accused 1 and 2 are guilty for the

above offences and accordingly, they wee convicted and sentenced.

The other accused were acquitted. Aggrieved with the conviction and

sentence, accused Nos. 1 and 2 preffered Crl.Appeal No.589/2011 in

the lower appellate court, which was also dismissed confirming the

conviction and sentence ordered by the trial court. It is against the said

conviction and sentence accused Nos.1 and 2 in the above case

preffered this revision petition. Except Section 498A and 406 of Indian

Penal Code, the other offences charged against the revision petitioners

are compoundable. It is under the above circumstances, the revision

petitioners preffered Crl.M.A No.5489/2014 under Section 482 with a

prayer to set aside the conviction and sentence for which the additional

Crl.R.P No.856 of 2013
                                                 4



2nd respondent has no objection.

          6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case and especially in the light of the decision of the Appex Court in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT108(SC)], in which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                      "57.     The position that emerges from the above
              discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the High
              Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
              exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
              the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
              offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
              plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
              in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
              secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
              of any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
              proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
              offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
              the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
              prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

"......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising

from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the

offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire

dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its

Crl.R.P No.856 of 2013
                                         5



view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to

great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with

the victim........"


         I am of the view that following the above reffered judgment, it is

only just and proper to allow the present application and to dispose the

revision petition accordingly.

        In the result, Crl.M.A No.5489/2014 is allowed, consequently the

conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioners are set aside,

allowing Crl.R.P No.856/2013 and they are acquitted of all the charges

levelled against them.

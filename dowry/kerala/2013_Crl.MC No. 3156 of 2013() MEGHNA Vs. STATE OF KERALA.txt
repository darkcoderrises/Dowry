                   Crl.M.C.No. 3156 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of the petitioner, who is 1st accused in Crime No. 412 of 2013

of Narakkal police station, Ernakulam district for the offences

punishable under Sections 403 and 420 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash the investigation in Crime 412 of 2013 of Narakkal

police station as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that in Crime

No.412 of 2013 of Narakkal police station, Ernakulam district

is that the accused by using the A.T.M card number, assigned

to the de facto complainant, withdrew an amount of

Rs.10,000/- and Rs.20,000/- on two occasions, on 27.02.2013

and thus obtained pecuniary advantage of Rs.30,000/- and

thereby the accused committed the offences punishable under

Sections 403 and 420 of IPC. Now the case of the petitioners

is that the matter is settled between himself and the de facto

complainant who is the 3rd respondent herein who sworn into

Annexure-A2 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

Crl.M.C.No. 3156 of 2013               2



well as the 3rd respondent.           I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

                4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.                 Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

                5. The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against her.

                6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No. 3156 of 2013                  3



                7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 403 and 420 of I.P.C which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 3rd respondent, it appears to me

that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                        "57. The position that emerges from
                the above discussion can be summarised
                thus:     the power of the High Court in
                quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
                complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
                jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
                power     given   to   a  criminal   court  for
                compounding the offences under S.320 of
                the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
                plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
                has to be exercised in accord with the
                guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

Crl.M.C.No. 3156 of 2013                  4



                secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
                abuse of the process of any Court. In what
                cases      power    to  quash    the    criminal
                proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
                exercised where the offender and victim
                have settled their dispute would depend on
                the facts and circumstances of each case
                and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

                 "......... But the criminal cases having
                 overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
                 flavour stand on different footing for the
                 purposes    of   quashing,    particularly the
                 offences      arising   from      commercial,
                 financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
                 such like transactions or the offences
                 arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
                 etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
                 is basically private or personal in nature
                 and the parties have resolved their entire
                 dispute.    In this category of cases, High
                 Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
                 its    view,  because   of   the  compromise
                 between the offender and victim, the
                 possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
                 and continuation of criminal case would put
                 accused to great oppression and prejudice
                 and extreme injustice would be caused to
                 him by not quashing the criminal case
                 despite    full and complete settlement and
                 compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

Crl.M.C.No. 3156 of 2013             5



above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter

is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

                In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I F.I.R in Crime No. 412 of 2013 of Narakkal Police

Station and all proceedings thereto.

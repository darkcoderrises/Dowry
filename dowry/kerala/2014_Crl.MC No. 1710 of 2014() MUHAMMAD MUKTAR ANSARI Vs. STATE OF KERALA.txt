                  Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
       =.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=.=
            Dated this the 25th day of March, 2014

                            O R D E R

      This is an application filed by the sole accused in

Crime     No.191/2014 of Thoppumpadi Police Station,

Ernakulam District to quash the proceedings in view of the

settlement arrived at between the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent- defacto      complainant under Section      482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the

sole   accused in Crime No. 191/2014 of Thoppumpadi

Police Station at Ernakulam District and he is working in

Indian Navy as Chief Mechanic (AR), Naval Aircraft Yard,

Kochi.  The defacto       complainant is none other than his

younger sister.    On account of some incident happened,

Annexure A1 crime was registered as Crime No. 191/2014

of Thoppumpadi Police Station on the basis of the

statement given by the          2nd respondent - de facto

complainant. Now the matter has been settled between the

Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
                                  2

parties due to the intervention of family members and

other well-wishers. The de facto complainant does not

want to proceed with the prosecution.

        3.     In view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case as well. Since the

offence alleged is non-compoundable in nature,            they

cannot         file any application before any other court.

Further since, the matter is in the crime stage, neither

the police nor the court also will drop the proceedings,

though the matter has been settled between the parties.

So he has no other option except to approach this Court

seeking the following reliefs:

             "i) Quash Annexure A1 F.I.R. in Crime

             No.191/2014      of Thoppumpady       Police

             Station, Ernakulam District:

             ii) Grant such other reliefs as this Hon'ble

             Court may deem fit and proper to grant in

             the facts and circumstances of the case".

        4.     The 2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled between

herself and the petitioner, who is her elder brother. She

Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
                                   3

does not want to prosecute the case              and    she filed

Annexure 3 affidavit stating these facts.

        5. Learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that in view of the settlement, even if            the case    is

allowed to proceed with, no conviction will be possible.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

        6. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that except

this case, there is no other case against the petitioner

and it is a dispute between            brother and sister, but

opposed           the application on the ground         that the

investigation is in the primitive stage.

        7.     It is an admitted    fact that the petitioner and

the de facto complainant ie. 2nd respondent are brother

and sister. It is also an admitted fact that on the basis

of the statement given by 2nd respondent, Thoppumpadi

police       had        registered Annexure I, first information

report as Crime No. 191/2014 against the petitioner

alleging commission of offence            under Section 324 of

Indian Penal Code.             Now the matter has been settled

between the parties due to intervention               of  family

Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
                                    4

members and other well-wishers. The 2nd respondent

does not want to proceed with the prosecution against

her brother in view of the settlement arrived at.

        8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

               "The position that emerges from the above
       discussion can be summarised thus: the power
       of the High Court in quashing in criminal
       proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of
       its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
       from the power given to a criminal court for
       compounding the offences under S.320 of the
       Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
       no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
       in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
       power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
       to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
       In what cases power to quash the criminal
       proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
       exercised where the offender and victim have
       settled their dispute would depend on the facts
       and      circumstances      of each   case  and  no
       category can be prescribed.         However, before
       exercise of such power, the High Court must
       have due regard to the nature and gravity of
       the crime.           Heinous and serious offences of
       mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
       dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
       though the victim or victim's family and the
       offender have settled the dispute.             Such
       offences are not private in nature and have

Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
                                     5

       serious impact on society.              Similarly, any
       compromise between the victim and offender in
       relation to the offences under special statutes
       like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
       committed by public servants while working in
       that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
       for quashing criminal proceedings involving
       such offences.          But the criminal cases having
       overwhelmingly           and   pre-dominatingly   civil
       flavour stand on different footing for the
       purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
       arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
       civil,     partnership or such like transactions or
       the offences arising out of matrimony relating
       to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
       wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire
       dispute.         In this category of case, High Court
       may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
       because          of  the  compromise     between   the
       offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of
       criminal case would put accused to great
       oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
       would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal         case   despite   full and   complete
       settlement and compromise with the victim. In
       other words, the High Court must consider
       whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
       interest of justice to continue with the criminal
       proceeding or continuation of the criminal
       proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
       process          of  law    despite   settlement  and
       compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
       and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
       appropriate that criminal case is put to end and
       if the answer to the above question(s) is in
       affirmative, the High Court shall be well within

Crl. M.C. No. 1710 of 2014-C
                                      6

       its      jurisdiction      to   quash   the criminal
       proceeding."

        9.      In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a dispute

between brother and sister, it was settled due to the

intervention of mediators and the pendency of this case

should not be a hurdle for their harmony in the family

life, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure

has to be invoked, though the case is in the preliminary

stage of investigation, to promote harmony between the

family members that has been caused on account of the

settlement, to              quash the proceedings.

        So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No. 194/2014 of Thoppumpadi Police Station of

Ernakulam District as against the petitioner is hereby

quashed.

        Office is directed to communicate this order to the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Kochi to be

communicated                to the concerned Police Station for

                                       7

necessary further action in this regard.

          Dated this the 23rd day of March, 2007

                             O R D E R

     Revision petitioner was convicted and sentenced under

Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code ('IPC', for short) to

undergo simple imprisonment for seven years.            The conviction

and sentence were entered by the Assistant Sessions Judge who

tried the case and thereafter it was confirmed by the Sessions

Court.

     2.According   to    the    prosecution,      the   deceased  Sini

committed suicide by consuming poison and this happened within

seven years of marriage of the deceased with the accused. It is

also the case of prosecution that deceased Sini was harassed

and treated cruelly by her husband who is the revision petitioner

herein, soon before her death, in connection with demanding

dowry which was agreed to be paid within six months from the

date of marriage. The harassment started from the second day of

the marriage itself and the deceased Sini was sent back to her

parental house from where she committed suicide.

       3. After analysing the evidence adduced by the prosecution

and on hearing both sides, both courts found that the offence

under Section 304-B IPC is proved against the accused. But

learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the

court committed      illegality in not following the procedure laid

down in Sections 232 and 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

('the Code', for short) and hence the conviction and sentence

passed against the revision petitioner cannot be sustained. He

has placed reliance upon the decisions reported in Sivamani v.

State of Kerala (1992(2) KLT 227), Chandran v. State of Kerala

[2005(4) KTL 962] and Dinesh Kumar v. State of Haryana [2006

(4) KLT SN 49] in support of his arguments.

       4. On going through the records, particularly the proceeding

sheet and the questioning of the accused conducted under

Section 313 Cr.P.C., I find that the trial court has not followed the

procedure under Section 232 of the Code.            Under the said

provision, the accused has a right of hearing. This has been

denied to the accused. The proceeding sheet would show that

the accused was not heard nor was he or prosecution heard

before the accused was called upon to enter on his defence. As

per Section 232 of the Code, if after taking the evidence for the

[Crl.R.P.485/00]                    3

prosecution, examining the accused and hearing the prosecution

and the defence on the point, the Judge considers that there is no

evidence that the accused committed the offence, the Judge shall

record an order of acquittal. The hearing of the accused and the

prosecution is thus necessary under Section 232 of the Code.      It

is well settled that the hearing of the prosecution and the defence

is a must under Section 232 of the Code but the proceedings

sheet and the records show that there was compliance of Section

232 of the Code.

       5. In the light of the decisions cited above by learned

counsel for the revision petitioner, t he conviction and sentence

have to be set aside. The court is bound to proceed with the

case after compliance of the requirements under Sections 232

and 233 of the Code as laid down in the said decisions. In such

circumstances, I am not going into the merits of the case.

       In the result, the conviction and sentence passed against the

revision petitioner are set aside. The case is remanded to the trial

court for fresh consideration and disposal in accordance with law.

The parties shall appear before the trial court on receipt of notice

to their counsel from the trial court.

       The Revision Petition is allowed.

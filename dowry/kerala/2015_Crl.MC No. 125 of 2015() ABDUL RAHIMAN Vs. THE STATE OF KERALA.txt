           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime

No.1209/2013 of Hosdurg Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-B final report in Crime No.1209/2013 of

Hosdurg Police Station as against the petitioners and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1312/2014 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg,

quashed.

Crl.M.C.125/2015
                               : 2 :



      4.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto    complainant,   who   is   the   2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

Crl.M.C.125/2015
                               : 3 :



against     the  petitioners   and,   therefore,   all  further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed. She has entered appearance through her counsel.

The learned counsel for the defacto complainant also

endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in by the

defacto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the

2nd respondent are living together as husband and wife and

are leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just

and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-B

final report in Crime No.1209/2013 of Hosdurg Police

Station as against the petitioners and all further proceedings

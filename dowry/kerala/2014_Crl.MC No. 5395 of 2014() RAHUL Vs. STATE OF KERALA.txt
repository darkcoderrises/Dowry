                   ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 31st day of October, 2014.

                              O R D E R


      The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime

No.792/2013 of Pathanapuram Police Station alleging offences

under Sections 109, 452, 366 and 34 of the IPC based on a

complaint of the 2nd respondent's father. Annexure-A1 is the

copy of the FIR in the aforementioned Crime and after

investigation    the    police   submitted      Annexure-A3   Final

Report/Charge Sheet in the aforementioned Crime, which is

now pending as C.P.No.134/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur. It is clearly stated in

Annexure-A1 FIR that the 2nd respondent was aged 18 years at

the time of the occurrence on 27.5.2013.            The gist of the

prosecution case is that the 1st petitioner with an intention to

have illicit intercourse with the 2nd respondent, kidnapped her

through 2nd and 3rd petitioners (who are the 1st petitioner's

friends), on 27.5.2013 at about 7:00 pm and that the 1st

petitioner had hired a Maruthi Alto Car Taxi and entrusted it to

2nd and 3rd petitioners and they came to the 2nd respondent's

parental house and kidnapped her against her will. It is stated

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

by the petitioners that though initially the 2nd respondent was

caught by the police on 27.5.2013 and the police had prepared

Annexure-A2 deposition and Medical Certificate as per

Annexure-A4. It is certified in Annexure-A4 Medical Certificate

dated 28.5.2013 that there is no evidence of any recent sexual

act and there is no evidence of any signs of resistance, after

examining the 2nd respondent.          It is further stated in

Annexure-A4 Medical Certificate that the 2nd respondent has

stated before the Doctor that she was having a love affair with

one Rahul for the last three years and that one month ago she

had physical relationship with him. It appears that it is the 1st

petitioner (Rahul), who is referred to in Annexure-A4 as stated

above.   The 2nd respondent has filed Annexure-A5 affidavit

dated 29.5.2013 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-III, Punalur stating that she has never raised such an

allegation as in Annexure-A2 against the petitioners and

further submitted that the parents of the 1st petitioner and the

2nd respondent have given their consent to the marriage

between the 2nd respondent and the 1st petitioner and that she

has not given the statements referred to in Annexure-A2 and

that none of the petitioners have committed any criminal

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

offence against her etc. It is further stated that the petitioners

and 2nd respondent and their families are now having cordial

relationship and that the above referred incident happened in a

provocation and that after the intervention of the mediators,

the cordial relationship have been restored between the

families. It is stated in Annexure-A5 that the aforementioned

crime was lodged under false impression and that no such

kidnapping has happened as alleged and that the 2nd

respondent    has   already   filed  an   affidavit  before   the

jurisdictional Magistrate concerned as per Annexure-A5 and

that the 2nd respondent has no objection in quashing the

impugned criminal proceedings and that the relationship

between the parties have been restored with the help of

mediators and that the parties are not intending to adduce any

evidence in the above criminal case etc. In Annexure-A5 the

defacto complainant has also stated that after the intervention

of the family members of the 1st petitioner and 2nd respondent,

it has been decided that the marriage between the 1st

petitioner and 2nd respondent should be solemnised within one

year. The 2nd respondent-defacto complainant has sworn to an

affidavit dated 18.9.2014 marked as Annexure-A6 before this

                                ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

Court in this Crl.M.C. It is stated therein by the 2nd respondent

that the disputes between the parties have been settled and

that she does not intend to proceed with the case and give

evidence in this matter etc. and has reiterated the earlier

submissions.     It is in the conspectus of these facts and

circumstances that the petitioners have filed this Crl.M.C with

the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-A3 Final

Report/Charge Sheet filed in the impugned Annexure-A1 FIR in

Crime No.792/2013 of Pathanapuram Police Station, which has

led to the institution of C.P.No.134/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur and all further

proceedings arising therefrom.

      2.    The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Smt.Devika Rani

has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent.

      3.    Heard Smt.T.S.Maya, learned counsel for the

petitioners, Smt.Devika Rani for the 2nd respondent and

learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent-

State.

      4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

                                ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has

submitted on the basis of the specific instructions furnished by

the 2nd respondent that in view of the aforementioned aspects,

the 2nd respondent does not wish to proceed with the

impugned criminal proceedings in any manner and that

continuation of the proceedings would only result in mere

disharmony as the defacto complainant has clearly stated that

she has no complaint against the petitioners and that the

impugned criminal proceedings may be quashed. The learned

counsel for the 2nd respondent has also stated that the 2nd

respondent has no grievance against the petitioners and that

she does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and that she will not raise any dispute or complaint

                                ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

in future if the prayer for quashing the impugned criminal

proceedings is allowed.

        6.    The learned Public Prosecutor was also heard who

has submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in the

case in the light of law well settled by the court in this regard.

        7.    After having carefully considered the case of the

parties, it is noted that the 2nd respondent-defacto complainant

had attained the age of 18 years as on the date of occurrence

(27.5.2013) as clearly shown in impugned Annexure-A1 FIR.

The main allegations in the impugned criminal proceedings are

under Section 366 Indian Penal Code in respect of kidnapping

a woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it

to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person

against her will, or in order that she may be forced to seduced

ti illicit intercourse etc. On a perusal of Annexures A1 & A3, it

can be seen that there are no allegations of committing any

sexual intercourse against her will or without the consent etc,

involving the commission of offence under Section 375 (rape).

It is clearly certified in Annexure-A4 Medical Certificate that

there is no evidence of recent sexual act and there is no

evidence of any signs of resistance, after examination of the

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

2nd respondent by the Doctor.         Further it is certified in

Annexure-A4 Medical Certificate dated 28.5.2013, issued in

respect of the impugned crime, that the 2nd respondent has

stated that she was in love with one Rahul (presumably the 1st

petitioner) as stated above for the last three years and that

she had physical relationship with him about one month back.

It is further stated by the defacto complainant in Annexure-A5

affidavit dated 29.5.2013 filed before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-III, Punalur that accused has not committed

any activities in relation to alleged crime and that the parents

of the 1st petitioner and 2nd respondent have now agreed for

marriage between the 1st petitioner and 2nd respondent.

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that there was a love affair

between the 1st petitioner and 2nd respondent at the time of the

commission of alleged crime and that the incidents should be

seen and appreciated in the light of this crucial factual aspects.

There are no allegations of commission of rape in the instant

case, as in Annexure-A4 Medical Certificate dated 28.5.2013

issued in the said crime, it has clearly stated that there is no

evidence of recent sexual act and there is no evidence of any

signs of resistance etc. Annexure-A4 also clearly shows that

                                ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

the 2nd respondent has stated that she was in love with the 1st

petitioner for the last three years and in Annexure-A5 affidavit

also the 2nd respondent has reiterated that families of the 1st

petitioner and 2nd respondent have also agreed to their

marriage. Therefore, this incident could have happened due to

a rash and brash attitude shown by the petitioners. The 1st

petitioner is aged 21 years, 2nd petitioner 22 years and the 3rd

petitioner is 22 years. The 2nd respondent-defacto complainant

is now aged 19 years.       The 2nd respondent seems to have

voluntarily gone along with the 1st petitioner and she was aged

18 years as on the date of occurrence of the incident.

Therefore, in the light of Annexure-A6 and in the light of

affidavit sworn to by the 2nd respondent, the prayer could be

favourably considered.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

           "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

                                   ::9::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their     dispute  would   depend    on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
       and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
       footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
       offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
       civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
       offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc.
       or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
       private or personal in nature and the parties have
       resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases,
       High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
       view, because of the compromise between the offender
       and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
       bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
       accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"



In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in

2014 (8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR

426 (SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

                                  ::10::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

            "When the High Court is convinced that the
      offences are entirely personal in nature and, therefore,
      do not affect public peace or tranquility and where it
      feels that quashing of such proceedings on account of
      compromise would bring about peace and would secure
      ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307

r/w Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    The Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

(2012) 10 SCC 303, after surveying many decisions of the

court on the point, has categorically held that the inherent

powers of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C is of wide

plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

process of any court          or (iii) to do real, complete and

substantial justice. The Supreme Court in the case State of

Haryana v. Bhajan Lal reported in 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335

= (1992) SCC (Cri) 426 as laid down the parameters of

quashing the Crl.M.C. In the case Inder Mohan Goswami

and another v. State of Utharanchal and others reported

in (2007) 12 SCC 1, the Apex Court has held that every High

Court has the inherent power to "ex debito justitiae" to do

real, complete and substantial justice for the administration of

                                ::11::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

which the court exists or to prevent the abuse of process of

court. In Shaji @ Pappu v. Radhika and another reported

in 2011 (4) KHC 616 (SC), the Supreme Court while quashing

the impugned FIR therein lodged for offences under Sections

354 and 394 IPC has held that even if an offence is non-

compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C, the High Court can

still, in exercise of its inherent powers, quash the proceedings

in a case where there is no chance of recording a conviction

against the accused and entire exercise of a trial is destined to

be an exercise in futility in view of the settlement arrived at

between the parties. In the case Saliha K.N. v. Abdulla &

others reported in 2013 (1) KHC 772, this Court while

quashing the FIR lodged under Sections 324 and 308 IPC has

held that the courts have and owe a duty to redeem the

parties from fighting against each other since the matter is

settled and so, the impugned proceedings can be quashed.

       10. Viewing the facts and circumstances in this case in

the frame work of the legal principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions cited above, this Court is of the

considered opinion that discretion could be exercised in this

case, for reasons more than one.           Firstly, there are no

                              ::12::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

allegations of commission of offence of rape and Annexure-A4

medical certificate would clearly show that there is no evidence

of any recent sexual act and there is no evidence of any signs

of resistance. Annexure-A4 medical certificate and Annexure-

A5 affidavit would also show that it is the specific case of the

2nd respondent, even immediately after the occurrence of the

incident, that she was in love with the 1st petitioner and that

there are even proposals of the families for their marriage.

So, the incident would have occurred due to the rashness and

brashness shown by the petitioners who are aged hardly in

their early 20's, due to the over zealousness in the love affair

between the 1st petitioner, who was aged 21 years and the 2nd

respondent, aged 18 years at the time of occurrence of the

incident.   In view of the specific affidavit sworn to by

the    2nd  respondent and in view of Annexure-A5 affidavit

sworn to by the 2nd respondent before the court below,

chances of recording of any conviction appears to be remote.

Moreover, this Court is of the considered opinion that

redeeming these youngsters from long drawn process of the

trial, would only subserve the ends of justice.      Accordingly,

this Court is of the considered opinion that discretion vested in

                               ::13::

Crl.M.C.No.5395 Of 2014

this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the impugned

proceedings could be exercised in the facts of this case.

      Accordingly, Crl.M.C. is allowed. Impugned Annexure-A3

Final Report/Charge Sheet filed in Annexure-A1 FIR in Crime

No.792/2013 of Pathanapuram Police Station which has led to

the institution of C.P.No.134/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioner

shall forward certified copies of this order to the Station House

Officer, Pathanapuram Police Station and to the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur.




                                          ALEXANDER THOMAS,

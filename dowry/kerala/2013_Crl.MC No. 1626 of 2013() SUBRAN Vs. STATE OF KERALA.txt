                  Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 03rd day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in S.C.No.794 of 2010 on

the file of the Fast Track Court No.II, Thrissur          which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.72 of 2008

of Chalakudy Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 304 & 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-I

Charge Sheet and all further proceedings in S.C.No.794 of

2010 on the file of the Fast Track Court No.II, Thrissur as the

matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The allegation against the petitioners is that as the

result of an accident occurred in the granite quarrying

operations conducted by the accused on 25/01/2008 a lady

died due to the impact of injuries sustained on her head and

thus the allegation is that the accused has committed the

Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
                            :-2-:


offence punishable under Section 304 read with Section 34 of

IPC.

     3.   Now the case of the petitioner is that, the matter is

settled out of court.     The second respondent, de facto

complainant has sworn into Annexure-II affidavit. Similarly,

the legal heirs of the deceased in the above case has also

sworn into Annexure-III affidavit.

     4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     6. The learned counsel for the respondents 2, 3 and 4

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the 2nd respondent, who is the de

Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
                              :-3-:


facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and they have no grievance against

them.

     7. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-II & III affidavits.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

     8. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the

above case are only under Sections 304 & 34 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me

Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived

by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.1626 of 2013
                             :-6-:


the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I Charge Sheet and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.794 of 2010 on the file of the

Fast Track Court No.II, Thrissur.

                  ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
           =========================
                  Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014
         ============================
         Dated this the 05th day of November, 2014

                            ORDER



      The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.447 of

2013 of Vazhakkad Police Station, registered for offences

punishable under Sections 448, 341, 323, 354, 427 and 506(i) r/w

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

      2. The prosecution case is that on 06.09.2013 at about 17:00

hours at Cheruvayoor Karingaliparambath, the accused attacked

respondents 3 to 5 in the house of A2, when the 2nd respondent

pulled the maxi of the de facto complainant and assaulted the 3rd

respondent. It is further alleged that by breaking the glass of the

window, a loss of Rs.500/- is caused to the house of the 3rd

respondent and also had intimidated the 4th respondent.        The

police after investigation submitted the impugned Annexure A

final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime No. 447 of 2013

of Vazhakkad Police Station.      On the basis of the impugned

Annexure A final report/charge sheet, the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II (Forest Offences), Manjeri had taken

cognizance of the case and has numbered the case as Calendar

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014          2



Case, C.C No.564 of 2014 against the petitioners. It is stated

that now the disputes between the petitioners and the contesting

respondents 2 to 4 have been amicably settled and as they are

neighbours, the prosecution further continued would only lead to

disharmony of the relationship, which has been now restored and

that it will be sheer wastage of precious time of the court and

that there is no remote possibility for conviction in this case. The

contesting respondents 2 to 4 have separately filed affidavits

before this Court as Annexures B, C and D respectively on

25.09.2014 stating all these aspects and further stating therein

that apart from the registration of the impugned crime number

herein, viz. Crime No.447 of 2013 of Vazhakkad Police Station,

the petitioners had initiated complaint against the contesting

respondents which led to the registration of Crime No.454 of

2013 in which the contesting respondents are the accused and

that the entire matters have been settled amicably through

mediation out of court and that the relationship between the

parties are now very good and that they have no further

complaints against the petitioners and that the impugned

criminal proceedings may be quashed by this Court as prayed in

this Crl.M.C. It is in the light of these facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014          3



that the petitioners have filed the instant Crl.M.C seeking the

prayer to quash the impugned Annexure A final report/charge

sheet filed in the impugned Crime No.447 of 2013 of Vazhakkad

Police Station, and all further proceedings arising therefrom in

the interest of justice.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.R.Ranjith has

taken notice for the respondents 2 to 4 and the learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State of

Kerala.

      4.    Heard Sri.Babu.S.Nair, the learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners, Sri.R.Ranjith , learned counsel appearing for

respondents 2 to 4 and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing

for the 1st respondent-State of Kerala.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned impugned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of

the aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014          4



of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.R.Ranjith, the learned counsel appearing for the

respondents 2 to 4, has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the respondents 2 to 4 that they have

amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and that they

have no objection in the quashment of the impugned criminal

proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as they

have no grievance against them and that they will not raise any

dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014              5



not much element of public interest is involved.               The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4, it is clear to

the court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of

the settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Apex Court in the case

between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1)

SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108

(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [See SCC (Cri)]:

                "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.      In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
         facts and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014                  6



It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
           and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
           footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
           offences          arising       from        commercial,
           financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
           relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
           wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
           the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of
           conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
           criminal case would put accused to great oppression
           and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
           to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
           and complete settlement and compromise with the
           victim........"

       In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8) Scale 634

= III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC), the Apex Court

has held as follows:

              "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
       entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
       peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
       proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace
       and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
       them".

       The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014          7



         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

Crl.M.C No.6237 of 2014            8



supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. In the interest of

justice, it is ordered that the impugned Annexure A final

report/charge sheet filed in the impugned Crime No.447 of 2013

of Vazhakkad Police Station, which has led to the institution of

C.C No.564 of 2014 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - II (Forest Offences), Manjeri and all further proceedings

arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners shall produce

certified copies of this order before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II (Forest Offences), Manjeri as well as before

the Station House Officer, Vazhakkad Police Station.

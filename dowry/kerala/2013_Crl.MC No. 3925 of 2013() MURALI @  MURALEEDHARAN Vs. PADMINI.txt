                  Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.No.805 of 2013 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ranni

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.628 of 2009 of Ranni Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 326, 294(b) &

506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-1 F.I.R. in Crime No.628 of 2009 of Ranni Police

Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.805 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ranni as the matter is settled

out of court.

     2.   The prosecution case is that the goat of the accused

entered into the property of the de facto complainant and on

being questioned there was a wordy quarrel on 18/10/2009

Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
                             :-2-:


and after that accused persons had wrongfully restrained the

de facto complainant for 3 minutes and assaulted her by

beating with hand on the chest and back. The 1st accused had

thrown a stone on the de facto complainant which resulted in

fracture on the left vertebra. CW.2 was also attacked by the

4rh accused and 1st accused by throwing stone.             Thus,

according to the prosecution, the accused four in number

committed the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323,

324, 326, 294(b) & 506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. Now

the case of the petitioners is that the entire dispute is settled

with the first respondent, who is the de facto complainant and

the second respondent, who is the injured. According to the

petitioners, in view of the settlement arrived, the respondents

1 and 2 have sworn into Annexure-2 affidavits.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
                             :-3-:


settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-2 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only 341, 323, 324, 326, 294(b) & 506(ii)

Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
                                    :-4-:


read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

Crl.M.C.No.3925 of 2013
                             :-6-:


encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 F.I.R. in Crime No.628 of 2009 of Ranni Police

Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.805 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ranni.

                    B.A. No.8647 of 2014

                           --------------

           Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1100 of

2014 of the Piravom Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 447, 498A

and 506 (ii) IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

his wife and treated her with cruelty by demanding more

dowry and gold ornaments, after misappropriating her entire

gold ornaments and money. It is alleged that on 28.09.2014,

he reached the house of the defacto complainant, wherein

she was residing with her mother. He abused and attacked

them. He attacked her mother and also beat her sister. He

has committed mischief by damaging the household articles,

electric bulbs and flower pots.

BA No.8647/2014
                                  : 2 :



      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   The contents of the CD prima facie reveal the

complicity of the petitioner. It seems that the attempt of the

petitioner is to take way the entire household articles by a

vehicle, that was obstructed by the Police. The investigation

of the case is not over. Considering the seriousness of the

allegations against the petitioner and the present stage of

the investigation, I am of the view that this is not a fit case

wherein the discretionary relief of anticipatory bail can be

granted to the petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

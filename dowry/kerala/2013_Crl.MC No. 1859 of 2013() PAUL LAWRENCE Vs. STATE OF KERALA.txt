            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 14th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the   petitioners,   who    are   accused     Nos.1    to 3   in

C.C.No.479/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kollam which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No. 1530/2011 of Kundara Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 and r/w

Section 34 of the I.P.C., with a prayer to quash Annexure I

Charge Sheet in C.C.No.479/2012of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kollam     as against the petitioners as the

matter is settled out of court.

        2.      The allegation in the above case is that the

accused in the above case had unlawfully restrained and

caused hurt to his body, for the reason that the 2nd respondent

had not given his Mobile Phone to the petitioner and used

abusive languages by the petitioners and now, the case of the

petitioners are that the matter is settled out of court.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
                                2

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
                                   3

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 341, 323, 324 and r/w

Section 34 of the I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from

          the above discussion can be summarised

          thus:      the power of the High Court in

          quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

          power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for

Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
                                  4

          compounding the offences under S.320 of

          the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

          has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases      power   to quash   the    criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes      of quashing,  particularly the

          offences      arising   from     commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences

Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
                                   5

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its   view,    because   of  the  compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

          8.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

Crl.M.C.No. 1859 of 2013
                                6

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -1 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 479 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kollam and all further proceedings thereto.

                     ----------------------------------------
              Crl.M.C.Nos. 3631,3632,3679 & 3680 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                   As the parties to the above four Crl.M.Cs. are one and

the same and the facts are identical in nature and the offences alleged are

also same and especially when the entire dispute is settled between the

parties, the above four Crl.M.Cs. are heard together, though the same are

directed against different calendar cases pending before the same court

below and being disposed of by this common order.

          2. The subject matter of the cases pending before the court below

is that connected the purchase of vehicle, the accused availed of loan

from the second respondent/the de facto complainant and thereafter the

accused defaulted in making the monthly instalments and thus, according

to the de facto complainant, who is the second respondent in the above

Crl.M.Cs., the petitioner/accused committed the offences punishable under

Sections 406 and 420 of I.P.C.      Stating the above allegation, the second

respondent filed separate private complaints before the court below which

Crl.M.C.Nos.3631,3632,3679 & 3680 of 2013


                                      :-2-:

were forwarded for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. and

eventually, the Police filed separate charge sheets in four crimes and thus,

C.C.No.298/2012, 299/2012, L.P.No.81/2010 and C.C.No.300/2012 are

instituted against which respectively Crl.M.C.Nos. 3631,3632,3679 &

3680 of 2013 are filed. Now, the case of the petitioner is that during the

pendency of the above cases, the entire dispute is settled with the de facto

complainant, who is the second respondent and acknowledging the above

claim of the petitioner/accused, the Manager(Legal) of the second

respondent/Bank/ the de facto complainant filed separate affidavits dated

29.8.2013 and 30.8.2013 in the above petitions.        From the facts and

circumstances involved in the case, it appears that the entire prosecution is

originated connected with the financial transaction with respect to the

purchase of four separate vehicles and now, the parties to the dispute

settled both the criminal and civil liabilities.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.Nos.3631,3632,3679 & 3680 of 2013


                                        :-3-:

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above cases, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above cases.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above cases is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and they have no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case, it can

be seen that the offences involved in the above cases are only Sections 406 and 420 of

I.P.C which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

Crl.M.C.Nos.3631,3632,3679 & 3680 of 2013


                                           :-4-:

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
           can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

Crl.M.C.Nos.3631,3632,3679 & 3680 of 2013


                                          :-5-:

           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present

cases and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present cases. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court

to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in

the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to

me, following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.Cs can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed, quashing all proceedings

pending       against      the     petitioner     in    C.C.No.298/2012,299/2012,

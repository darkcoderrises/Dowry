                            --------------

                         B.A. 6248/2006

                          ------------------

  DATED THIS THE 19TH DAY OF OCTOBER, 2006




                            O R D E R




            The     petitioner   is   the   father-in-law   of   the


defacto   complainant.     She   complaints   that   she   had   been


mentally and physically harassed by the petitioner, taking


advantage   of   the   debilities,   alleged   against   her   husband.


Further   allegation   is   that   the   petitioner   had   been


continuously   demanding   more   dowry   and   he   was  making


advances   towards   the   complainant   with   ulterior   motives.


Her   statement     is   that   her   husband,     the   son   of   the


petitioner,  is fully ineffective in controlling  the misdeeds


of  his father, the petitioner.  Hence, she made a complaint


before the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Ernakulam,


which   was   forwarded   to   Palarivattam   Police   Station,


which registered the case   as crime No.414/2006, for the


offence   punishable   under   Section   498A   IPC   against   the


petitioner alone.  Therefore,  he is before this Court, for a


pre-arrest order.

        2.    After   hearing   both   sides   and   considering   the


materials   that   are   available   in   the   case   diary   files,   I


direct   the   petitioner   to   surrender   before   the


Investigating   Officer   on   25.10.2006   between   10.00   a.m


and 10.30 a.m.


        3.    The Investigating Officer shall interrogate the


petitioner   and   thereafter,   produce   him   before   the


Judicial   Magistrate   of   First   Class-I,   Ernakulam,   on   the


same day, before 4.00 p.m.


        4.    The   learned   Magistrate   shall   allow   the


petitioner   to   be   on   bail,     imposing   such   conditions,   as


are deemed necessary.


              The application is disposed of as above.

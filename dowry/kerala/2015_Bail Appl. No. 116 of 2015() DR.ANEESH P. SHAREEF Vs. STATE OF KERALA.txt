                      =================
                       B.A.No.116 of 2015
                     ==================
                Dated this the 18th day of March, 2015


                             O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2. The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.707 of

2014 of the Thrithala Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 107, 312 313, 315, 316,

323, 406 and 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3. The petitioner herein was the husband of the defacto

complainant. Both are Doctors by profession. It is alleged

that an amount of 75,00,000/- was squeezed as dowry by

the petitioner from the parents of the defacto complainant.

Two children were born in the wedlock. It is alleged that the

B.A.No.116 of 2015
                                 2

petitioner was not willing even to have the birth of the 1st child

and he had insisted the defacto complainant to undergo an

abortion, to which she was not willing.       Finally, her family

members intervened and ultimately, it seems that the

petitioner had agreed for the delivery. When she conceived for

the 2nd time, she was forced to take medicines for getting her

pregnancy aborted and by force, he administered medicine to

her and the pregnancy was terminated. When she conceived

for the 3rd time, she was not willing for a miscarriage and

thereby she was brutally beaten up and she was kicked on

her abdomen, thereby complications developed and ultimately

she had to undergo an abortion. When she conceived for the

4th time, it seems that the petitioner had again insisted her to

undergo an abortion. As she was not willing, she was beaten

up and she was kicked on her abdomen.            Even then the

pregnancy continued and she gave birth to a child.

      4. It is further alleged that the defacto complainant was

being beaten up regularly. It is also alleged that the father of

the petitioner, who is the 2nd accused, used to make sexual

overtures towards the defacto complainant. When she has

B.A.No.116 of 2015
                               3

complained about it to the petitioner, her complaints fell in

deaf ears. When she was under the after confinement care of

the 2nd child, it seems that the petitioner had all of a sudden

issued a Talak letter to the defacto complainant, thereby

intimating her he had effected an extra judicial divorce.

Whether that is valid divorce or not, is not a question to be

considered here.

      5.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

counsel for the defacto complainant and learned Senior

Public Prosecutor.

      6.    The contents of the CD prima facie reveal the

complicity of the petitioner. The contents of the Talak letter

are self speaking to the conduct of the petitioner. It seems

that the petitioner has complained that the defacto

complainant was not willing for sexual intercourse when she

was under the after confinement care during the birth of the

2nd child. The allegations against the petitioner are very grave

and serious. Considering the seriousness of the allegations

against the petitioner, I am of the view that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioner is required for the continued

B.A.No.116 of 2015
                                   4

investigation of this case. Considering the facts and

circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the petitioner

is not entitled to the discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

       In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

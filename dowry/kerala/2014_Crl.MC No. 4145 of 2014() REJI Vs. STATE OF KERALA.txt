                ===========================
                      Crl.M.C No.4145 of 2014
               ============================
                Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014

                              ORDER


      Petitioners are accused in C.C No.1342/2011 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Thiruvananthapuram,

which was instituted on the basis of the report filed by the

Peroorkada police in Crime No. 1125/2011, which is registered at

the instance of the third respondent herein, who is the wife of the

first petitioner. Petitioner Nos.2 and 3 are mother and brother of

the first petitioner. According to the petitioners, the above crime

was registered connected with some family disputes occurred

among the petitioners and the third respondent and after

registration of the F.I.R and institution of C.C No.1342/2011, the

entire dispute has been settled. Therefore, to seek an order under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure quashing Annexure A1

Crl.MC No.4145/2014               2




F.I.R, Annexure A2 charge sheet and all further proceedings

against the petitioners in C.C No.1342/2011 the above Crl.M.C is

filed.

      2. Heard the learned counsel for petitioners and the counsel

appearing for third respondent and also the learned Public

Prosecutor.

      3. The de facto complainant, third respondent herein and the

first petitioner are respectively wife and husband whose marriage

was solomnized on 25.08.2005 in accordance with the religious

rites and custom prevailing among the Hindu religion and,

according to the third respondent, while she was residing in her

matrimonial home, she was subjected to mental and physical

harassment. Thus, the petitioners/accused committed the offences

punishable under Sections 498A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Now, according to the petitioners as well as the third respondent,

Crl.MC No.4145/2014             3




who sworn in Annexure A3 affidavit, the entire dispute has been

settled and third respondent is not proposed to prosecute the

criminal case against the petitioners.    According to the third

respondent, after amicable settlement of the entire issues, third

respondent is now residing along with the first petitioner in her

matrimonial home. In Annexure A3 affidavit, she has expressed

that she has no objection in quashing the charge sheet as prayed

for.

      4. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case and especially when the dispute among the spouses settled

and when they are leading a peaceful marital life, the duty of this

court is to encourage such settlement it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.MC No.4145/2014                         4




                     "57.   The position that emerges from the above
           discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
           Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
           complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
           and different from the power given to a criminal court for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends
           of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.       In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
           the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
            pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
            the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
            from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership
            or such like transactions or the offences arising out of
            matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
            where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
            and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
            category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
            proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
            between the offender and victim, the possibility of
            conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
            case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
            and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
            quashing the criminal case despite        full and complete
            settlement and compromise with the victim........"

Crl.MC No.4145/2014                5




       5.    Accordingly, this is a fit case where this Court can

exercise the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioners.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed quashing Annexure A1

F.I.R, Annexure A2 charge sheet and all further proceedings in C.C

No.1342/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - II, Thiruvananthapuram against the petitioners.

                   ================
                  Crl.M.C. No. 1766 of 2015
             =======================
              Dated this the 6th day of April, 2015

                          O R D E R




      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.590 of 2010 of the

Kadakkavoor Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram District,

registered for the offence punishable under Section 498A read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-B Final Report in Crime No.590

of 2010 of the Kadakkavoor Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram

District,  and    all further  proceedings     based     on  it in

C.C.No.127/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Varkala, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 1766 of 2015
                                2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd    respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.              She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.     Through a settlement, the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

                                   3

leading a peaceful married life.          When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioner, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-B Final

Report in Crime No.590 of 2010 of the Kadakkavoor Police

Station, Thiruvananthapuram District, and all further proceedings

based on it in C.C.No.127/2011 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Varkala, are hereby quashed.



                                                  Sd/-
                                      B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

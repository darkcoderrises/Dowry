             Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015
       -----------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of May, 2015

                         ORDER

          The petitioner is the husband of the second

respondent,       who    is   arrayed     as    accused    in

Crime.No.870/2011     of  Thoppumpady       Police   Station,

Ernakulam registered as a complaint filed by the second

respondent alleging offences punishable under Section

498A, IPC. Now the issues between the petitioner and the

second respondent have been settled amicably and the

second respondent filed Annexure B affidavit stating that,

she doesn't want to proceed with the prosecution against

the petitioner and she has no subsisting grievances at all

in the present time. This Criminal M.C. is filed to quash all

prosecution proceedings against the petitioner under

Annexure A, final report.

          2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and learned counsel for the second respondent. The

learned counsel for the petitioner drew my attention to

Gian Singh v. State of Panjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)],

Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015             2

in support for this Criminal M.C.

             3. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh's case (supra).             In the above

case, three Judge Bench of the Apex Court, on a reference,

considered the question whether the High Court has

power to quash criminal proceedings involving non-

compoundable offences on the basis of the compromise

reached between the offender and the victim and

answered as given below:

             "57. The position that emerges from the

             above discussion can be summarised

             thus:     the power of the High Court in

             quashing a criminal proceeding or F.I.R.

             or complaint in exercise of its inherent

             jurisdiction is distinct and different from

             the power given to a criminal court for

             compounding the offences under S.320 of

             the Code.     Inherent power is of wide

             plenitude with no statutory limitation but

             it has to be exercised in accord with the

             guideline engrafted in such power viz;(1)

             to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

             prevent abuse of the process of any

             Court. In what cases power to quash the

             criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

             may be exercised where the offender and

Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015             3

             victim have settled their dispute would

             depend on the facts and circumstances of

             each case and no category can be

             prescribed. However, before exercise of

             such power, the High Court must have

             due regard to the nature and gravity of

             the crime. Heinous and serious offences

             of mental depravity or offences like

             murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be

             fittingly quashed even though the victim

             or victim's family and the offender have

             settled the dispute. Such offences are not

             private in nature and have serious impact

             on society.    Similarly, any compromise

             between the victim and offender in

             relation to the offences under special

             statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

             or the offences committed by public

             servants while working in that capacity

             etc; cannot provide for any basis for

             quashing criminal proceedings involving

             such offences.      But the criminal cases

             having      overwhelmingly      and     pre-

             dominatingly     civil flavour    stand  on

             different footing for the purposes of

             quashing, particularly the offences arising

             from commercial, financial, mercantile,

             civil, partnership or such like transactions

             or the offences arising out of matrimony

             relating to dowry, etc., or the family

Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015            4

             disputes where the wrong is basically

             private or personal in nature and the

             parties have resolved their entire dispute.

             In this category of cases, High Court may

             quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

             because of the compromise between the

             offender and victim, the possibility of

             conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put

             accused    to   great    oppression       and

             prejudice and extreme injustice would be

             caused to him by not quashing the

             criminal case despite full and complete

             settlement and compromise with the

             victim. In other words, the High Court

             must consider whether it would be unfair

             or contrary to the interest of justice to

             continue with the criminal proceeding or

             continuation of the criminal proceeding

             would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise

             between the victim and wrongdoer and

             whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

             appropriate that criminal case is put to an

             end and if the answer to the above

             question(s) is in affirmative, the High

             Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

             quash the criminal proceeding."

             4. In view of the proposition laid down above,

Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015         5

the question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in this

case can be compounded, in the exercise of the inherent

power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the offences alleged

against the petitioner will not come under the category of

non-compoundable         offences, which   are   specifically

excluded from composition, in the exercise of inherent

power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit

filed by the de facto complainant, it is seen that the

dispute between the accused and the victim had been

amicably settled and, at present, the de facto complainant

has no subsisting grievance at all.          The de facto

complainant does not want to proceed with prosecution

against the accused.         Full and final settlement and

compromise with the victim are evidenced by Annexure-A.

In view of the compromise between the petitioner and the

victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is remote,

bleak and continuation of the criminal case would, put the

parties     to     great oppression,  prejudice   and   also

Crl.M.C.No.2634 of 2015         6

tantamount to abuse of the process of the court.    The

present criminal prosecution against the accused must be

put to an end to secure the interest of justice.

      3. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against the petitioner under Annexure-A final report will

stand quashed.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

             Dated this the 14th day of January, 2010

                            O R D E R

      This is an application for anticipatory bail under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is the

accused in Crime No.204/2008 of Pampady Police Station,

Kottayam.

      2.   The offence alleged against the petitioner is under

Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.   Originally, apart from the petitioner, three other

persons were also made accused in the crime.           Later,   the

names of accused Nos.2 to 4 were deleted from the array of

accused. Now the petitioner is the sole accused.

      4. After completing the investigation, charge was laid in

the case. The case was numbered as C.C. No. 960/2008 on the

file of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I,

Kottayam. Since the presence of the petitioner could not be

secured, the case was treated as Long Pending Case and it is

numbered as L.P. No. 230/2009. It is stated that a non bailable

warrant is pending against the petitioner.           The petitioner

  B.A. No. 213 of 2010              2




apprehends arrest in execution of the non bailable warrant.

     5. The petitioner and two other accused filed Crl. M.P.No.

1718/2008 before the Court of Sessions, Kottayam under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for anticipatory

bail. As per the order dated 18.07.2008, Anticipatory Bail was

granted to the petitioner and two other accused. The learned

Sessions Judge held that on the arrest of the petitioners within

one month, the Sub Inspector of Police shall release them on bail

on executing a bond for Rs. 30,000/- each with two solvent

sureties. It is submitted that the petitioners therein were not

arrested within one month and there was no occasion for them

for complying with the conditions in the order. It is also

mentioned in the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge

that a petition for divorce was pending and that divorce was

sought by the wife on the allegation that the marriage was not

consummated. It was also noticed in the order that there was

no specific allegation of dowry harassment.        The   learned

Sessions Judge noticed that custody of the accused was not

required for the purpose of investigation.

   B.A. No. 213 of 2010               3




      6. In Vineeth Somarajan @ Ambadi Vs. State of Kerala

[2009 (3) KHC 471] it was held that in cases where non bailable

warrant is issued by a court, the proper remedy of the accused is

to approach that court which issued the warrant and to apply for

recalling the warrant and for the grant of bail.       It was also

observed in Vineeth Somarajan's case that when such an

application for bail is filed, the same has to be considered in the

light of the principles laid down in Biju Vs. State of Kerala [2007

(2) K.L.T. 280].

             Reserving the right of the petitioner to move the

Court which issued the non bailable warrant, to recall the

warrant and to grant bail, this Bail Application is closed.   If the

petitioner files an application for the said purpose, the learned

Magistrate shall consider and dispose of the same in the light of

the principles laid down in the decisions referred to above and in

the light of the facts and circumstances mentioned above.

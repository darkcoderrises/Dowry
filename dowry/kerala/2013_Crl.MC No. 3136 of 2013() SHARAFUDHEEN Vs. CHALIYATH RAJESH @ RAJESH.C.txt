                  Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 26th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in L.P.No.68 of 2008 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.74 of 2006 of Kottakkal Police Station for the offence

punishable under Section 406 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-B Final Report in Crime No.74 of 2006 of Kottakkal

Police   Station,   Malappuram         District    and   all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in L.P.No.68 of

2008 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Malappuram as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.      The allegation in the above case is that, on

16/01/2006, petitioner being a friend of the de facto

complainant/first respondent borrowed the Scorpio Car (KL-

09-L-9675) belonging to the first respondent representing that

Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
                             :-2-:


he requires it in connection with a marriage. However, later

petitioner failed to return the Car. Subsequently, petitioner

was also found missing. In that context, first respondent has

preferred a complaint before the second respondent on

13/3/2006, which lead to the registration of the crime. During

the course of investigation, the vehicle was recovered by the

police on 20/3/2006 itself. On completion of the investigation,

police laid charge against the petitioner. Now the case of the

petitioner is that the dispute between himself and the first

respondent, who is the de facto complainant is settled out of

court.  Annexure-C is the affidavit sworn into by the first

respondent/de facto complainant.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
                             :-3-:


proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-C affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Section 406 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
                                     :-4-:


involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

               "57.   The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
                                      :-5-:


        "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

        pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

        for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

        arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

        partnership or such like transactions or the offences

        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.No.3136 of 2013
                             :-6-:


the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-B Final Report in Crime No.74 of 2006 of Kottakkal

Police   Station,   Malappuram        District and all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in L.P.No.68 of

2008 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Malappuram.

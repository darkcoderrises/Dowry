                  O.P.(Crl.)No.2037 of 2013
               -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                            JUDGMENT

        The Original Petition (Crl.) under Article 227 of the

Constitution of India is filed praying inter alia to set aside all

proceedings in Ext.P1 i.e., M.C.No.126 of 2012 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thalassery to the

extent it is against the petitioner.

     2.    According to the petitioner, she is the mother-in-law

of the petitioner in Ext.P1 complaint which was filed under

Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence

Act, 2005 in which she is made as respondent No.1. It is the

case of the petitioner that, she is a destitute and for her

maintenance she depends upon the income of her elder son.

The said fact spell out from Ext.P3 order of the Family Court,

Thalassery.     Therefore, according to the petitioner, the

proceedings as per Ext.P1 is an abuse of process of court as

far as the petitioner is concerned. Therefore, she prays for

quashing proceedings in Ext.P1 pending in the court below.

O.P.(Crl.)No.2037 of 2013
                             :-2-:


     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and I

have perused the materials produced along with the above

Original Petition (Crl.)

     4.    As I indicated earlier, the petitioner herein is the

first respondent in Ext.P1 which is a proceeding instituted

under Section 12 of the above Act against the respondents 5 in

number, seeking various reliefs as provided under the

provisions of the above Act. It is pertinent to note that in

Ext.P1 petition, the claimant has sought for an order under

Section 19(8) for return of dowry and for monetary relief

under Section 20 and compensation and damages under

Section 22 of the Act and also claimed protection under

Section 18. In the light of Ext.P3 and in view of submission of

the learned counsel for the petitioner, it appears that, the

claim and contention of the petitioner is that she is a

dependent of her elder son for her maintenance. According to

me, Ext.P3 order is a matter to be considered by the trial court

in the light of the evidence and materials being produced in

that court during the trial and to take a decision on the relief

O.P.(Crl.)No.2037 of 2013
                              :-3-:


sought for after considering Ext.P3 as well. However, at this

stage, it can be seen that as this Court observed the relief

sought for in Ext.P1 not only the monetary relief. Thus, if the

trial court on conclusion of the trial is of the opinion that

petitioner/first respondent therein is also liable to order in

terms of the relief sought for in Ext.P1, this Court will not be

justified, at this stage quashing Ext.P1 proceedings against the

petitioner herein. Therefore, there is no merit in this petition.

      In the result, the above Original Petition (Crl.) is

dismissed.

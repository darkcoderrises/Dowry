                         ORDER



     These revision petitions are filed challenging the

common order passed in M.C.Nos.107/2012 and 727/2013

on   the   files  of   the    Family   Court,   Malappuram.

M.C.No.107/2012 was filed by the revision petitioner in R.P

(FC) No.260/2015 seeking cancellation of the order passed

in M.C.No.250/10 and M.C.No.727/2013 was filed by his

wife and daughter seeking enhancement of the maintenance

allowance in the above M.C. After considering both M.Cs

together, the Family Court dismissed M.C.No.107/2012 and

allowed M.C.No.727/2013 granting enhancement at the rate

of 400/- per month to both respondents.        This common

order is under challenge in this revision petition.    The

parties are referred to as in M.C.No.107/2012.

     2. The petitioner is the husband of the 1st respondent

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  2

as well as the father of the 2nd respondent, who is a minor,

aged 7 years. The marital status of the 1st respondent and

the paternity of the 2nd respondent are not disputed and the

fact that in M.C.No.250/2010, the petitioner was directed

to pay maintenance allowance at the rate of 3,100/- to the

1st respondent        and 1,500/- to the 2nd respondent. The

petitioner filed M.C.No.107/2012 on the ground that, at the

time when the earlier order was passed, he was working

abroad and now he returned to India and is working as a

salesman in a shop. Thus, there is a considerable reduction

in his income.          That apart, subsequently, he married

another woman who had to undergo an expensive heart

surgery and a child is born to him in that wedlock. So, he

has to look after his second wife and child. Thirdly, the 1st

respondent is in possession of 7 lakhs given by the

petitioner and thus there is no circumstance to enhance the

quantum of maintenance allowance.             But, there are

reasonable circumstances to cancel the maintenance

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  3

allowance earlier ordered in M.C.No.250/10.

      3. In M.C.No.727/13, the contention raised by the

respondents         are that the quantum of maintenance

allowance determined in the year 2010 in M.C.No.250/10 is

not sufficient to meet the steep hike in the cost of living and

the educational expenses of the 2nd respondent. According

to them, there is a considerable increase in the income of

the petitioner also. Therefore, he is liable to pay enhanced

maintenance allowance at the rate of 10,000/- to the 1st

respondent       and 6,000/- to the 2nd respondent.      As   a

counter to the averments in M.C.No.107/2012, they

contended that 7 lakhs was given to them as a value of

gold ornaments, which was taken away by the petitioner

and also the return of dowry, which was received from the

1st respondent        at the time of marriage.   Both parties

adduced evidence. After considering the evidence let in by

both parties consists of the oral evidence of PWs.1 and 2

and Exts.A1 to A6, RW1 and Ext.B1 produced by the

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  4

petitioner, the court below dismissed M.C No.107/2012 and

allowed M.C No.727/2013 granting enhancement @ 400/-

per month         to both respondents. The legality of the

dismissal of M.C.No.107/12 and the correctness of the

enhancement made in M.C.No.727/2013 are challenged in

this revision petition.

      4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.

      5. The learned counsel for the petitioner advanced

arguments assailing the findings whereby the court below

dismissed M.C.No.107/12 and the findings whereby the

court below determined the enhancement @ 400/- per

month to both respondents.

      6.    Going by the impugned order, it is seen that

M.C.No.107/2012 was dismissed on the reason that,

"Section 127 of the Cr.P.C is intended only for alteration in

the allowance on proof of change in the circumstances and

the said provision does not contemplate cancellation of an

order of maintenance passed under Section 125 of the

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  5

Cr.P.C.    The above reasoning is supported by the decision

reported in Joy Varghese v. Leelamma & Another [2007

(2) KHC 884]. Having regard to the statutory mandate

under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C and the decision referred

above, I do not find any reason to interfere with the said

finding.    Thus, the court below is justified in dismissing

M.C.No.107/2012, which was filed seeking cancellation of

the maintenance order granted under Section 125 of the

Cr.P.C.

      7. Then the question to be considered is, whether the

enhancement made in M.C.No.727/13 is justifiable? Going

by the impugned order, it is seen that the petitioner has no

case that he is physically disabled or incapacitated to do

work. The settled legal position is that, means signify not

only movable or immovable property in the shape of salary,

rent or agricultural income but also the earning capacity of

a physically able bodied man. It is the case of the petitioner

that he has to maintain his second wife and child. I am of

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  6

the opinion that the said contention cannot be taken as a

ground to deny enhancement of maintenance allowance. It

is true that the personal law of the petitioner permits him

to marry more than once up to four. But the personal law

itself insists that he has to maintain all the wives equally

and do justice to all. If that be so, the liability to maintain

the second wife cannot be taken as a ground to deny the

enhancement of maintenance allowance claimed by the first

wife. At the time of contracting the second marriage, he

was fully confident of the liability to give maintenance

allowance to his both wives in accordance with their

requirements, living status and standard of life. Therefore,

in the above view of the matter, the court below is justified

in rejecting the said contention.

      8. Similarly, even though he has paid 7 lakhs to the

1st respondent, the same was given as value of her

ornaments and dowry which was given to the petitioner at

the time of marriage.         This explanation given by the 1st

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                  7

respondent was not disputed in cross examination and no

evidence has been adduced to prove otherwise. Therefore,

the court below is justified in rejecting the said contention

also.    There is no evidence to show that,        after the

pronouncement of the earlier order, the 1st respondent got

any permanent employment or any permanent sources of

income. Steep hike in the living cost, caused by inflation is

a fact which does not require any evidence as the same is a

universal phenomena. The earlier order was passed in the

year 2010. Indisputably, the living cost of a person is much

higher than that of the year 2010 and four years have been

elapsed after the passing of the earlier order. In that view

of the matter, I find that the enhancement @ 400/- per

month to both respondents is not excessive.

      9. The learned counsel for the petitioner sought for

some tome to pay the arrear. Having regard to the facts

and circumstances of the case, the revision petitioner is

given five months' time to pay the arrear, provided that, the

R.P (FC) Nos.260 & 261 of 2015
                                      8

revision petitioner shall pay half of the entire arrear within

a period of three months from today and the remaining

balance shall be paid within the next two months. In the

event of failure to pay the first instalment within the

specified time, this instalment facility will stand cancelled

automatically and the Family Court will be free to enforce

the realisation of entire arrear in lump sum.

      In the result, these revision petitions will stand

dismissed.

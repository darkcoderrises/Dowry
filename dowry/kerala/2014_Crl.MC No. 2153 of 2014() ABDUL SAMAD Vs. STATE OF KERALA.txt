                    Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014
                  ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014.

                             O R D E R



      Petitioners herein are the two accused in S.C.No.16/2013

on the file of the Additional Sessions Court-III, Kasaragod.

Petitioners were originally accused Nos. 2 & 5 in Crime

No.26/2012 of Hosdurg Police Station. They appeared in crime

stage and released on bail and the case against them was

committed and numbered as S.C.No.16/2013 as above said. The

case against them was registered on the basis of an oral

complaint of the complainant, 2nd respondent herein, against the

accused alleging offences punishable under Secs. 143, 147, 148,

341, 324, 326 & 308 r/w 149 IPC by the Station House Officer,

Hosdurg Police Station in Crime No.26/2012. The police after

investigation    submitted     impugned       Annexure-A1  Final

Report/Charge Sheet. The prosecution case is that on 13.1.2012

at about 23:15 hrs, while CWs1 & 2 were travelling in a motor

cycle, the accused, in furtherance of their common intention

restrained and attacked with an iron rod and that thereby they

have committed the above said offences. Final Report/Charge

Sheet in Crime No.26/2012 was filed by the Station House

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

Officer, Hosdurg Police Station against the four accused persons

alleging the above said offences and taken into file as

C.P.No.123/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Hosdurg. The case against accused 2 & 5 (petitioners

herein) was committed to the sessions court. The case against

A1 & A3 was split up and refiled as C.P.No.1737/2012 and made

over to long pending list as they were absconding.       The two

petitioners herein are the accused in S.C.No.16/2013 on the file

of the Additional Sessions Court-III, Kasaragod. It is stated that

the petitioners and the 2nd respondent were close family friends

and that the names of the petitioners were implicated in the

crime only due to misunderstanding and due to doubt and

subsequently the matter has been settled. The 2nd respondent,

who is the defacto complainant, has given Annexure-A2 consent

letter signed before the Advocate Notary stating that the entire

disputes between the parties have been settled and that the

impugned criminal proceedings against the petitioners may be

terminated etc. The 2nd respondent (defacto complainant) has

sworn to affidavit dated 27.3.2014 produced as Annexure-A3 in

this Crl.M.C stating that subsequently the disputes have been

amicably since the names of the petitioners are mentioned only

                                ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

due to misunderstanding and normal doubt and that now the

disputes have been fully settled between them and that the 2nd

respondent has no grievance against them and that the

impugned criminal proceedings against the petitioners in

S.C.No.16/2013 may be quashed by this Court.          That the 2nd

respondent has got a better job opportunity in the Gulf and that

in order to join for the said employment he is not in a position to

stay in the native place etc. It is in the light of these facts and

circumstances that the above said petition has been filed seeking

to quash the entire impugned proceedings arising out of

S.C.No.16/2013 pending on the file of the Additional Sessions

Court-III, Kasaragod etc.

      2.     The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.Ajeesh K.Sasi,

Advocate, has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and the

learned Public Prosecutor      has   taken    notice for   the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.     Heard Sri.K.P.Harish, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners, Sri.Ajeesh K.Sasi, learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing

for the 1st respondent.

                                ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

      4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both parties as the

real disputants to the controversy have arrived at an amicable

settlement and any further continuation of the criminal

proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and money

and would unnecessarily strain the judicial, administrative and

financial resources of the State.

      5.    Sri.Ajeesh K.Sasi, learned counsel appearing for the

2nd respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners

and that he has no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as

he has no grievance against them and that he will not raise any

dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

                                 ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

      6.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case in

the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature.

The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such offences are

involved, the real disputants to the controversy, which has led to

the impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the 2nd     respondent, it is clear to the

Court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at by them.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court

has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014


               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

                                   ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

            "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

                                ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.2153 Of 2014

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by

granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned criminal

proceedings in S.C.No.16/2013 on the file of the Additional

Sessions Court-III, Kasaragod and all further proceedings arising

therefrom are quashed in the interest of justice. The petitioners

shall produce certified copies of this order to the Station House

Officer concerned as well as before the court below concerned.

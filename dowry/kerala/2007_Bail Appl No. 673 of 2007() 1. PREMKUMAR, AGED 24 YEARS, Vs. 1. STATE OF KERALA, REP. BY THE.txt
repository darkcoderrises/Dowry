                  BAIL APPLICATION NO. 673  OF 2007

             DATED THIS THE 6th DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2007


                                      O R D E R


       Petitioners   who   are   accused   Nos.1   to   3   in   Crime   No.10/07   of


East   Police   Station,   Kollam   for   an   offence   punishable   under   section


498A read with section 34 IPC, seek anticipatory bail.


       2.     The marriage between Mayadevi the de facto complainant


and   the   first   accused   took   place   on   28.5.2006   and   she   has   left   the


matrimonial   home   within   a   short   span   of   six   months   in   November,


2006.     Her   allegation   in   the   complaint   lodged   before   the   Police   was


that   her   husband,   the   first   accused,   has   been   demanding   a   further


amount of Rs.3 lakhs by way of dowry.


       3.     It is too early to accept the petitioners' contention that he


has been falsely implicated in the case.   I am, therefore, not inclined


to   grant   anticipatory   bail   to   the   first   accused.     Regarding   accused   2


and 3 who are the parents of the first accused, I am inclined to grant


anticipatory   bail   to   them.     Accordingly,   a   direction   is   issued   to   the


officer-in-charge of the police station concerned to release  petitioners


2 and 3 on bail for a period of one month  in the event of their arrest


in connection with the above case on each of them executing a bond


for Rs.10,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like amount to


B.A.NO.673/07                         Page numbers



the   satisfaction   of   the   said   officer   and   subject   to   the   following


conditions:


                 1.     Petitioners   2   and   3   shall   report   before   the

                 Investigating  Officer   between   9   a.m.   and  11   a.m.   on   all

                 Wednesdays.



                 2.   Petitioners 2 and 3   shall make   themselves available

                 for   interrogation   as   and   when     required   by   the

                 Investigating Officer.



                 3.     Petitioners 2 and 3 shall not influence or intimidate

                 the   prosecution   witnesses   nor   shall   they   attempt   to

                 tamper with the evidence for the prosecution.



                 4.     Petitioners   2   and   3   shall   not   commit   any   offence

                 while on bail.



                 5.     Petitioners   2   and   3   shall   surrender   before   the

                 Magistrate   concerned   and   seek   regular   bail   in   the

                 meanwhile.




      If     petitioners   2   and   3   commit   breach   of   any   of   the   above


conditions, the bail granted to them shall be liable to be cancelled.


      In the case of the first petitioner who is the first accused, I am


inclined to permit him to surrender before the Investigating Officer for


the purpose of interrogation and then have his application for regular


bail ordered   by the  Magistrate.    Accordingly,  the   first  petitioner   shall


surrender   before   the   Investigating   Officer   on   any   day   between


B.A.NO.673/07                      Page numbers



7.2.2007   and   9.2.2007   for   the   purpose   of   interrogation.     After


interrogation,   he   shall   be   produced   before   the   Magistrate   having


jurisdiction   on   the   same   day,   who   shall   release   him   on   bail   on


appropriate conditions.


             This application is allowed in part as above.





                                                        V.RAMKUMAR,JUDGE.

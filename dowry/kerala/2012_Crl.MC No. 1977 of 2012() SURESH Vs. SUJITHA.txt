               Crl.M.C. NO. 1977 of 2012
          ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of September, 2012

                           ORDER


          Petitioner is the accused in a crime case involving

the offences punishable under Section 498A and 308 of the

Indian Penal Code. That crime was registered on a statement

recorded from his wife, who is alleged to have been brutally

assaulted by him pursuant to a demand for dowry. Spouses

have resolved all disputes is the crux of the case canvassed of

in filing the aforesaid petition to quash the criminal

proceedings against the petitioner proceeded on the basis of

Annexure I F.I.R. registered in the crime. Public Prosecutor

was directed to ascertain from the Investigating Officer

whether the spouses are living together after effecting a

settlement of the disputes, after conducting an enquiry, and,

if necessary, recording the statement of the parties as well.

Learned Public Prosecutor has now reported that the

petitioner is involved in a number of criminal cases and

Crl.M.C. NO. 1977 of 2012          2



proceedings under the KAPPA have also been initiated against

him. Adverting to the statement forming part of Anneuxre I

F.I.R., it is submitted that the alleged brutality on the wife by

the petitioner requires a thorough probe, and settlement if

any, effected by the parties cannot be                given any

consideration in taking appropriate steps for investigating the

crime.    After going through the statement of the de facto

complainant/the wife which led to registration of the crime

and also the circumstances canvassed by the learned Public

Prosecutor, I find this is not a fit case where inherent powers

of this court could be invoked of to quash the criminal

proceedings against the petitioner as canvassed by him.

             Crl.M.C. is dismissed.

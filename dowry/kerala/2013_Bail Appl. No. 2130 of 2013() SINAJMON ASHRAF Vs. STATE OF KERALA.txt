                               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner       is    the      first    accused        in  Crime

No.255/2013 of North Police Station, Alappuzha registered

for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323,

324, 452, 498A and 379 read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he,

along with the other accused, has severely tortured and

harassed the de facto complainant, who is his wife, by

demanding      more       dowry       and      gold     ornaments,     after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments. It is also

alleged that the de facto complainant girl took shelter at her

house. The petitioner along with the other accused, who

are the brothers-in-law and sisters, went to the house of the

de facto complainant, committed house trespass and there

                               : 2 :



also, she was subjected to beating. They have taken away

a DVD player and some gold ornaments and also the

remote control and key of the car, thereby committing theft.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD.             The

contents of the CD, prima facie, reveal the complicity of the

petitioner and the other accused. The records reveal that,

on    28.12.2012   the   girl  was   severely  beaten.    The

photographs of the girl contained in the CD, which was

taken after the incident, clearly show that serious injuries

were sustained to the face and other parts of the body of the

de facto complainant. They tortured the girl and after that,

the petitioner poured liquor into her mouth and she had to

be taken to the General Hospital, Alappuzha, from where

she was referred to the Medical College Hospital,

Alappuzha. The investigation of this case is not over. It is a

wonder that the learned Sessions Judge has chosen to

grant anticipatory bail to the other accused, after entering a

BA.No.2130/2013
                                  : 3 :



finding that there are serious allegations against the other

accused and the investigation was only at a primary stage.

Even according to the learned Sessions Judge, the said

petitioners in the application for anticipatory bail filed before

the learned Sessions Judge 'are menace to the society'.

The petitioner is not entitled to the discretionary relief of

anticipatory bail.

      In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

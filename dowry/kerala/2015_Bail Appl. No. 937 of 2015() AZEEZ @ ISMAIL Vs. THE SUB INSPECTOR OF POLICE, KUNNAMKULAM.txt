          Petition filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioner        is    the      1st    accused         in  Crime

No.213/2015 of Kunnamkulam Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 306 and 498A read

with Section 34 IPC.

     3.   The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the

deceased and forwarded undue demands of further dowry

and she was harassed with a view to procuring more money

and gold ornaments from her house. The deceased, who

could not withstand the harassment, has finally chosen to

commit suicide by pouring kerosene all over her body at 9

a.m. on 30.01.2015 at the matrimonial home and ignited

herself. The petitioner has been in custody for the period

detention of the petitioner in custody is not required for the

continued    investigation    of    this case.   No    criminal

antecedents have been reported against the petitioner.

Considering the facts and circumstances of this case and

having regard to the period undergone by the petitioner in

custody and the present stage of investigation, I am

satisfied that the petitioner can be enlarged on bail.

      6.   In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and

the petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on his executing a

bond for `50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two

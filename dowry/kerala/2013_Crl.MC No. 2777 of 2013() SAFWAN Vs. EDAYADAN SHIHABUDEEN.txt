                   Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 8th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.20 of 2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,Manjeri which is a case

instituted upon the police report [in Crime No.382 of 2012 of

Karipur Police Station] for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 and 427 r/w 149 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A charge sheet and all

further proceedings in C.C.No.20 of 2013 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri as the matter is settled out of

court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that on

18.07.2012 at about 12 hours, while the de facto complainant

was coming from the airport driving the Tavera taxi car

bearing registration number KL-53C-298 owned by him, the

accused persons 1 to 8 formed         themselves into unlawful

assembly, armed with stones with the common object of

committing the offence, stopped the vehicle and accused

Nos.1, 2 and 4 pulled the de facto complainant out of his car,

Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013            2

accused 3 and 5 hit on the face using hand, 6th accused

slapped on the neck, 7th accused stamped on the body and the

8th accused hit and scratched on the body of the car causing

loss to the tune of Rs.28,000/- to the de facto complainant

and thereby committed the offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 and 427 r/w Section 149 IPC.

Now the case of the petitioners are that the matter is settled

out of court between themselves and the de facto complainant

who is the first respondent herein.

              3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

              4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.                 Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

              5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013               3

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

              6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. Annexure- B

is the affidavit sworn into by the first respondent the de facto

complainant. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

              7.       Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 and 427 r/w Section 149 IPC which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.         It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013                4

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                       "57. The position that emerges from
              the above discussion can be summarised
              thus:      the power of the High Court in
              quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
              complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
              jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
              power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
              compounding the offences under S.320 of
              the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
              plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
              has to be exercised in accord with the
              guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
              secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
              abuse of the process of any Court. In what
              cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
              proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
              exercised where the offender and victim
              have settled their dispute would depend on
              the facts and circumstances of each case
              and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

              "......... But the criminal cases having
              overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
              flavour stand on different footing for the
              purposes      of quashing,   particularly   the
              offences arising from commercial, financial,
              mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
              transactions or the offences arising out of
              matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
              family disputes where the wrong is basically

Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013              5

              private or personal in nature and the
              parties have resolved their entire dispute.
              In this category of cases, High Court may
              quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
              because of the compromise between the
              offender and victim, the possibility of
              conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
              continuation of criminal case would put
              accused to great oppression and prejudice
              and extreme injustice would be caused to
              him by not quashing the criminal case
              despite    full and complete settlement and
              compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

Crl.M.C.No.2777 of 2013           6

relief as sought for.

              In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A charge sheet and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No. 20/2013 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Manjeri.

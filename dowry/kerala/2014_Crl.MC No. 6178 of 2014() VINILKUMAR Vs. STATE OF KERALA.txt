                   Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014
                 ---------------------------------
           Dated this the 31st day of October, 2014.

                            O R D E R



      The petitioner is the accused in the impugned Annexure-I

FIR in Crime No.50/2012 of Railway Police Station, Thrissur for

offences alleged under Sec.354 IPC and Sec.119(1)(a) of the

Kerala Police Act. The gist of the allegation therein is that on

9.8.2012 at 3:45 a.m. the accused, who was traveling in

Coach No.S 4 berth No.58 in Train No.16347, had attempted

to physically assault respondents 2 & 3 and with the intention

to outrage the modesty had touched the defacto complainant.

The police after investigation submitted the impugned

Annexure-II Final Report/Charge Sheet in the above said

impugned Annexure-I Crime No.50/2012 of Railway Police

Station, Thrissur which had led to the institution of the

calendar case, C.C.No.1364/2012 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-III, Thrissur. Respondents 2 & 3

herein are arrayed as CWs1 & 2 in the impugned Final

Report/Charge Sheet and CWs 3 & 4 are the alleged eye

witnesses and others are official witnesses. It is stated that

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

the petitioner and contesting respondents 2 & 3 have settled

the disputes between them and that the impugned criminal

proceedings may be terminated and that respondents 2 & 3

have    no   intention  to   proceed    with   the  prosecution.

Respondents 2 & 3 have separately filed affidavits on

25.10.2013 which are produced as Annexures III & IV in this

Crl.M.C stating the above aspects wherein it is stated that the

disputes between the above parties have been amicably settled

and that they have no grievances against the petitioner and

have no objection in quashing the impugned criminal

proceedings     which    has    led    to   the   pendency      of

C.C.No.1364/2012 on the file of the Judicial Fist Class

Magistrate Court-III, Thrissur. It is in the background of these

facts and circumstances the instant Crl.M.C has been filed with

the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-II Final

Report/Charge Sheet filed in the impugned Annexure-I FIR in

Crime No.50/2012 of Railway Police Station, Thrissur which

has led to the pendency of C.C.No.1364/2012 on the file of the

Judicial Fist Class Magistrate Court-III, Thrissur and all further

proceedings arising therefrom.

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.T.S.Sarath,

Advocate, has taken notice for the respondent Nos.2 & 3 and

the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.Vinay Ramdas, learned counsel appearing

for the petitioner, Sri.T.S.Sarath, learned counsel appearing for

the respondent Nos.2 & 3 and the learned Public Prosecutor

appearing for the 1st respondent.

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between

the parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both

parties as the real disputants to the controversy have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money     and    would    unnecessarily   strain   the  judicial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.T.S.Sarath,   learned    counsel  appearing    for

respondent Nos.2 & 3 has submitted on the basis of the

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

specific instructions furnished by the respondent Nos.2 & 3

that respondent Nos.2 & 3 have amicably settled the disputes

with the petitioner and that they have no objection in the

quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner as they have no grievance

against him and that they will not raise any dispute/complaint

in future if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is

allowed.

      6.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondent

Nos.2      &      3,   it  is   clear     to  the    Court     that  the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.

       8.      In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or

                                   ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
      category    of cases,    High  Court   may     quash   criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
      is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
      put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
      criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

             "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.     Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

                                ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.6178 Of 2014

      In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-II Final Report/charge Sheet filed in impugned

Annexure-I FIR in Crime No.50/2012 of Railway Police Station,

Thrissur which has led to the pendency of C.C.No.1364/2012

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III and

all further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The

petitioner shall produce certified copies of this order before the

Station House Officer concerned as well as before the

jurisdictional Magistrate concerned.

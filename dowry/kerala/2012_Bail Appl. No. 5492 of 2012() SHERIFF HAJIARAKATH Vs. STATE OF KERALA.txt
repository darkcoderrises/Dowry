                  B. A. No. 5492 of 2012
            =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
         Dated this the 3rd day of August, 2012

                          O R D E R

     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No. 48 of 2012

of Tanur Police Station. Offences alleged against him are

under sections 498A, 306 and 304B r/w section 34 IPC.

Apprehending arrest, this petition is filed for anticipatory

bail.

     2. Petitioner is the husband of Amina who was aged

19 years. The marriage between the petitioner and Amina

took place on 27-1-2011. The petitioner/husband sent

Ameena to her parental house and when she contacted him

over telephone on several times, he told her that she has

become the nuisance and if she wants to him to go to her,

she should give him again five soverigns of gold. She told

him that the gold ornaments given to him during the

marriage were appropriated by him. The petitoner also told

her that if she leaves him (to mean if the marital tie is

B.A.No.5492/2012            - 2 -

snapped), he can marry other good looking lady. This

conduct of the petitioner drove her to commit suicide, it

is alleged. So many other allegations are also raised. It is

alleged that he subjected his wife to cruelty demanding

more gold and money as dowry.

       3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it

was only on a misunderstanding, Amina poured kerozene

on her body and set herself on fire to commit suicide. Her

dying    declaration  was    recorded    by   the  learned

Magistrate. Ameena committed suicide within seven

years of the marriage. Presumption under sections 113A

and 113B of the Evidence Act also may be available, the

prosecution contends.

       4. Considering all these aspects, I am not inclined

to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage. Hence, this

petition is dismissed.

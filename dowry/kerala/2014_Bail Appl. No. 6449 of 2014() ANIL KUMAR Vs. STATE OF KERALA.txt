                 ===========================
                          B.A No.6449 of 2014
                ============================
              Dated this the 1st day of September, 2014

                                 ORDER


            Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No. 1138./2014 of

Thrikkakara Police Station. Apprehending arrest in the above crime, he

preffered the present application for anticipatory bail under Section 438

of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner married the

de facto complainant on 27.10.2014 and thereafter while the de facto

complainant was residing in her matrimonial home, she was physically

and mentally harassed saying that she was not beautiful and demanding

more dowry and thus, according to the prosecution, the petitioner has

committed the offences punishable under Section 498A r/w Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A No.6449 of 2014
                                       2



        4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

de facto complainant became pregnant after nine years from the date of

marriage and immediately after the child birth she has developed

Puerperal (Postpartum) psychosis disease and the entire allegation

against the petitioner is baseless.

       5. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that no specific allegation is registered against the petitioner and the

allegations are general in nature.

       6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, according to me, this petition can be allowed granting anticipatory

bail to the petitioner.

       In the result, this petition is allowed and, accordingly, there will

be a direction that in the event of the arrest of the petitioner in Crime

No.1138/2014 of Thrikkakara Police Station, he shall be released on

bail on executing a bond for `35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand

Only) with two solvent sureties, each for like amount, to the

satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above crime and on the

B.A No.6449 of 2014
                                     3



following further conditions:


           i)      Petitioner   shall  report   before   the
                   Investigating Officer in the above crime
                   on all second Saturdays between 10 a.m
                   and 11 a.m.

           ii)     Petitioner shall not tamper with the
                   evidence   and   try  to  influence   any
                   witnesses.

           iii)    Petitioner shall not interfere with the
                   investigation.

                    B.A. No. 4681 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 1st day of July, 2014


                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioners are accused in Crime No.594/2014 of

Kumily Police Station, which has been registered for

offences under sections 323 and 498A of IPC.

     3.   The 1st petitioner is the husband of the 1st

informant. Petitioners 2 and 3 are his brother and sister-in-

law.   The case was registered on the allegation that the

petitioners subjected the 1st informant to cruelty demanding

more dowry. It is submitted that the allegations are false

and the petitioners are innocent.

     4.   Heard.

     5.   It is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor

that during investigation the Police have sent a report to the

Magistrate informing that petitioners 2 and 3 are not

B.A. No. 4681 of 2014
                               -2-



involved in the case and their names may be deleted from

the party array.     The 1st petitioner and the 1st informant

have been married only for one year. They have one child.

I find that this is a fit case to make an attempt for reunion

of the parties to the marriage. If the 1st petitioner happens

to be detained the attempt will be frustrated.         So I am

inclined to grant the prayer of the 1st petitioner.

     6.    In the result, this application is allowed in part.

      i.   The 1st petitioner shall be released on bail on

           his    executing   a bond     for   Rs.20,000/-

           (Rupees Twenty thousand only) with two

           solvent sureties each for the like sum if he is

           arrested by the Police in connection with this

           case.

      ii.  He shall appear before the Investigating

           Officer for interrogation if he is so required

           by him in writing.

B.A. No. 4681 of 2014
                             -3-




      iii. He shall not harass the 1st informant or her

           relatives.

     The application is dismissed so far as petitioners 2 and

3 are concerned.

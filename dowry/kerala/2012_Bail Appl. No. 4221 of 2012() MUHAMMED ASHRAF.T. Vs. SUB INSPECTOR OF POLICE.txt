                   B.A. No: 4221 of 2012
           ------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 28th day of June, 2012

                         O R D E R

         The petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime

No:143/2012 of Panniyankara Police Station, Kozhikode.

The offences alleged are under sections 498-A and 306 r/w

34 of IPC.    The petitioner has been in custody since

05.06.2012.

    2.   The wife of the 1st accused committed suicide on

29.04.2012 at the matrimonial home.            The prosecution

contends that this petitioner subjected the deceased to

physical and mental cruelty demanding more dowry by way

of gold ornaments etc and that he also used to torture the

deceased and because of the unbearable cruelty treatment

meted out to her, she ended her life.

    3.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

the complaint was given by the elder brother of the

deceased after so many days,        only to wreck vengeance

                              -2-



and that the allegation of cruelty or demand for dowry

alleged to have been made, is only a false story.

     4.    Considering the period of detention already

undergone by the accused and in view of the submission

made on behalf of the accused that he will abide by any

condition that may be imposed on him, the accused is

granted bail with effect from 05.07.2012 subject to the

following conditions:

         (i)    The accused shall execute a bond

                for   Rs.50,000/-    (Rupees    Fifty

                sureties each for the like sum to the

                satisfaction of the concerned Court.

                If in case the Magistrate has any

                doubt about the genuineness or

                correctness of the tax receipts

                produced    by   the   sureties,  the

         (iv)   The accused will also file an affidavit

                that he will abide by all the

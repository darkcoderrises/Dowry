                  Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of August, 2013

                              ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 7 in C.C.No.896 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Palakkad which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.457 of 2011 of Kongad Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and 323 read with

Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A Final

Report in Crime No.457 of 2011 of Kongad Police Station and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.896 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Palakkad as the matter is settled out of

court.

     2.   The allegation in the above case is that the marriage

between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent was

solemnized on 19/03/2008 in accordance with their religious

rites and ceremonies, started living together in the residence

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                              :-2-:


of the 1st petitioner and while so on different dates the accused

Nos.1 to 7 subjected the 2nd respondent to physical and mental

cruelty in connection with dowry.        Thus according to the

prosecution the accused/petitioners have committed the

offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and 323 read with

Section 34 of IPC. It is the further case of the petitioner that

during the pendency of the case the entire dispute is amicably

settled between the parties and now the spouses are residing

together and leading a peaceful life and to that effect

Annexure-B affidavit has sworn into by the de facto

complainant, who is the second respondent.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case.     Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                             :-3-:


        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-B affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 498(A) and 323

read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                                         :-4-:


for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                   "57.    The position that emerges from the above

           discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

           High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

           complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

           and different from the power given to a criminal court for

           compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

           ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

           any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

           the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

           no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

           for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                                    :-5-:


         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

Further, in   Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case,       the Apex Court has held as

follows:-

                "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes

         have been on considerable increase in recent times

         resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A and

         406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also against

         the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin

         the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

         pending disputes for which both the sides approached the

         High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal

         proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can

         be declined on the sole ground that since the offences are

         non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

         would be impermissible for the court to quash the

         criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                                   :-6-:


        subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under

        Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the

        Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961,         with the help and

        intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers,

        the parties concerned have amicably settled their

        differences   and  executed     a  compromise/settlement.

        Pursuant    thereto,  the    appellants    filed   the  said

        compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place

        the same on record and to drop the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants herein. It is also not in dispute that

        in additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the

        parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating

        that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants and fully supported the contents of

        the settlement deed. It is the grievance of the appellants

        that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the

        parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

        jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the

        ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the

        offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC

        which are non-compoundable in nature."

               "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to

        encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,

        particularly, when the same are on considerable increase.

        Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if they relate

        to matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied that the

        parties have settled the same amicably and without any

        pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of

        justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the

        exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the

        subsequent criminal proceedings.

               13.  There has been an outburst of matrimonial

        disputes in recent times.     The institution of marriage

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                                    :-7-:


         occupies an important place and it has an important role

         to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

         made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable

         them to settle down in life and live peacefully.    If the

         parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their

         disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

         fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete

         justice in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be

         less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction.

         It is trite to state that the power under Section 482

         should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material

         on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the

         ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to be

         quashed."


Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings are

initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose among

the parties and both the disputes are now amicably settled

between the parties. According to me, in the light of the facts

and    circumstances         involved     in   the    present     case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties

to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2013
                             :-8-:


Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C.can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A Final Report in Crime No.457 of 2011 of Kongad

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.896 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Palakkad.

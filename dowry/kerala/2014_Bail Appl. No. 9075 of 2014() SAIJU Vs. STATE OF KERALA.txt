         Dated this, the 26th day of December, 2014.


                               O R D E R


      This is an application for anticipatory bail filed by the

accused in Crime No.2047/2014 of Chathannur police station

under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.  The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the

petitioner married the de facto complainant on 08.09.2005 and

thereafter, they were living together as husband and wife and

while so she was ill treated by him demanding more dowry and

thereby, he had committed the offence punishable under

Section 498(A) of Indian Penal Code.

      3.   The Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioner has not committed any offence. He is innocent of

the same and he has been falsely implicated in the case.

      4.   The   application        was      opposed        by   the Public

Prosecutor on the ground that investigation is not over.

      5.   It is seen from the documents produced by the

petitioner for perusal that on the basis of the statement given

by the de facto complainant - the wife of the petitioner, Crime

No.2047/2014 of Chathannur police station was registered

B.A.No.9075 of 2014           :  2 :

alleging offence under Section 498(A) of Indian Penal Code. It

is seen from the allegations that the marriage took place on

08.09.2005, but, the complaint was filed only on 07.11.2014

nearly after 9 years of the marriage. However, I am not at

this stage going into the question as to whether the allegations

are genuine or they are sufficient to attract the offence under

Section 498(A) of Indian Penal Code. Considering the fact that

it is a matrimonial offence and sending the spouse to jail is

likely to affect the possibility of settlement in future, this court

feels that anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner with

some conditions. So, the application is allowed with following

conditions:

      i)    The petitioner if arrested in connection with Crime

No.2047/2014 of Chathannur police station, then, he is

directed to be released on bail on executing a bond for

Rs.25,000/- with two solvent sureties         for the like sum

each      to       the   satisfaction      of     the     arresting

officer/respondent/investigating officer as the case may be.

      ii.   The petitioner shall appear before the investigating

officer for two consecutive days for the purpose of

interrogation between 9.00 a.m and 11.00 a.m immediately

B.A.No.9075 of 2014          :  3 :

after such arrest and release and thereafter, as and when

required in writing to do so till the final report is filed.

      iii)  The petitioner shall not intimidate or influence the

witnesses.

      iv)   The petitioner shall not leave State of Kerala

without getting prior permission from the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, South Paravur, Kollam District till the

disposal of the case.

      v.    If the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, South Paravur, Kollam District and

moves for regular bail, then, the learned magistrate is directed

to release the petitioner on bail on the same conditions as

stated above.

      With the above conditions, the application is dismissed.

           Dated this the 2nd day of April,       2014

                         O R D E R

     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the

sole accused in C.C. No. 840/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court -I, Punalur           to quash    the

proceedings on the basis of the settlement under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the

sole accused in Crime No. 161/2007 of Eroor Police Station,

Kollam District which was registered on the basis of the

statement given by 3rd respondent as         defacto complainant

alleging offences under Sections 341 and 324 of the Indian

Penal Code. After investigation,      final report was filed and

the case was taken on file as C.C. 840/2013 and it is pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Punalur.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties, the 3rd

respondent does not want        to prosecute     the petitioner in

view of the   settlement arrived at due       to    intervention of

mediators. Since some of the offences are non-compoundable

in nature, they could not file an application before the court

below for compounding. No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well in view of the settlement.

                                    2

Possibility of conviction is remote. So the petitioner has no

other remedy except to approach this Court seeking the

following reliefs:

                "In these circumstances, it is most respectfully

                prayed that this Hon'ble   Court may be pleased to

                quash    all further  proceedings  against     the

                petitioner/accused in Annexure - A2 final report in

                Crime No. 161/2007 of Eroor Police Station now

                pending before the Judicial First Cass Magistrate

                Court - I, Punalur   as C.C. 840/2013, as it is an

                abuse of process of court".

      3.    The 3rd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and he does not

want to proceed with the prosecution against the petitioner.

In view of the settlement arrived at due to the intervention of

mediators and their friendship has been restored on account

of the settlement. Counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,

there is no possibility of conviction and he prayed for allowing

the application.

      4. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor, on

instructions, as directed by this Court, submitted that there is

no other case against        the petitioner and he has no other

criminal background, but opposed the application.

Crl.M.C. No. 1865 of 2014
                                  3

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by 3rd respondent, Annexure - A1 crime was

registered as Crime No.161/2007 of Eroor Police Station of

Kollam District against the petitioner alleging offences under

Sections      324 and 341 of Indian Penal Code.              After

investigation     Annexure - A2 final report was filed and it was

taken on file as C.C. 826/2007 and that is pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Punalur.       In the

meantime, the matter has been settled between the parties.

Petitioner and       3rd respondent are friends which is evident

from Annexure - A3 affidavit filed by the 3rd respondent. Due

to the intervention of mediators and friends, the matter has

been settled between the parties and their friendship has

been restored.       So it cannot be said to be a case of public

interest    involved and it is a matter between two individuals

which occurred due to difference of opinion and now that has

been resolved and their friendship was restored. In view of

settlement there is no possibility of conviction also as either

the defacto complainant or        his witnesses will support the

prosecution.        By allowing the prosecution to continue is

only a futile attempt and wastage of judicial time.

Crl.M.C. No. 1865 of 2014
                                      4

       6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

              "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed.       However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard
      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious
      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the
      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial,  mercantile,   civil,   partnership  or  such   like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is
      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

Crl.M.C. No. 1865 of 2014
                                     5

      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
      settlement   and   compromise      between    the  victim  and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer
      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall
      be   well within its jurisdiction    to quash the criminal
      proceedings".

      7.     In   view of the dictum laid down              in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the petitioner and

the 3rd respondent are friends and the matter has been settled

due to intervention of mediators and the friendship has been

restored and in view of the settlement possibility of conviction

is remote,       this Court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the

settlement and restoration of friendship that has been caused

on account of the settlement. So application is allowed and

further proceedings in C.C. 840/2013 (Crime No. 161/2007 of

Eroor Police Station in Kollam District) pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Punalur as against the

petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order oto the

concerned court immediately.

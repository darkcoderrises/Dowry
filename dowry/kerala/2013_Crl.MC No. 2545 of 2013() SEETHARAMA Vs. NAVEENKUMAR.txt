               ------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No.2545 of 2013
               -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 24th day of June, 2013

                               ORDER


     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is accused No.5 in C.C.No.1358 of 2012 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod,

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.88

of 2009 of Badiadka Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323 & 324 read with Section

149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash entire proceedings in

C.C.No.1358 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod in Crime No.88 of 2009 of

Badiadka Police Station as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that, on

28/04/2009 at 20.40 hours at Badirpadavu in Badoor Village on

the side of Seethamgoli-Perla public road due to political enmity,

the accused persons wrongfully restrained the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.2545 of 2013
                            :-2-:


complainant and accused No.1 beat him with sticks and

accused Nos.2 to 5 beat him with hands. Now the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled between them and the

de facto complainant and the injured who are respectively

respondent Nos.1 to 3 who filed affidavits respectively

Annexures-C,D & E.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as respondent Nos.1 to 3. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties, which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 3 who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondents, who are the

de facto complainant/victims/injured do not intend to proceed

Crl.M.C.No.2545 of 2013
                             :-3-:


any further against the petitioner and they have no grievance

against him.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-C, D & E affidavits.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

323 & 324 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 3, it appears to me that the

Crl.M.C.No.2545 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


injured/the victims/the de facto complainant have no further

grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in

which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

Crl.M.C.No.2545 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

                             :-6-:


the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.1358 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kasaragod in Crime No.88 of 2009 of Badiadka Police Station.

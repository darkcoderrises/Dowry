                     Crl.M.C.No. 2014 of 2015
                ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015

                                ORDER




      The petitioners are accused in Crime No.248 of 2010 of Kakkur

Police Station and in C.C. No. 338/2011 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-III, Kozhikode. The learned Magistrate

took cognizance of the offences under Sections 323, 324, 340, 346,

498A and 506(11) of the Indian Penal Code, based on a private

complaint filed by the second respondent. Now, it is submitted on

behalf of the petitioners that the entire dispute between the

petitioners and the second respondent has already been settled and

the second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit which is

produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A3. Therefore, the prayer

in this Crl.M.C. is to quash Annexure A1 complaint and A3 Final

Report in Crime No. 248/2010 of Kakkur Police Station and C.C. No.

338/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,

Kozhikode.

      2.   Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned counsel

Crl.M.C.No. 2014 of 2015

for the second respondent.

      3.   In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to

a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is of wide plenitude

with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

the guideline engrafted in such power viz.; (i) to secure the ends of

justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what

cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR

may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case

and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such

power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and

gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be

fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in

nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

Crl.M.C.No. 2014 of 2015

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or

the offences committed by public servants while working in that

capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal

proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different

footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly offences arising from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating to

dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

entire dispute. In these categories of cases, High Court may quash

criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise

between the offender and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is

remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

Crl.M.C.No. 2014 of 2015

proceedings   or   continuation    of  criminal   proceedings   would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put

to an end and if the answer to the above question is in affirmative

the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the

criminal proceedings.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 340, 346,

498A and 506(11) of the Indian Penal Code.

     5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the second respondent has already been

settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second respondent

has also stated that the second respondent does not want to

prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners. The second

respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this Court as

Annexure A3 in this regard.

     6.    In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime No.248 of 2010

of Kakkur Police Station and in C.C. No. 338/2011 on the file of the

Crl.M.C.No. 2014 of 2015

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Kozhikode can be quashed by

this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid down by the

Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire proceedings

in Crime No.248 of 2010 of Kakkur Police Station and in C.C. No.

338/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,

Kozhikode against the petitioners are quashed.

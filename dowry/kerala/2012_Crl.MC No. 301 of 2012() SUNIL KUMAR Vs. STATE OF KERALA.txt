                    Crl.MC.No. 301 of 2012
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 6th day of November, 2012

                              ORDER

      Petitioners are the accused in a pending case numbered as

C.C.No.3009 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Irinjalakkuda.     They have been prosecuted for

offences punishable under Section 498 (A) and 406 of the Indian

Penal Code on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,

Puthukkad Police Station. Crime in the above case was registered

on a complaint filed by the 2nd respondent, the wife of the 1st

petitioner,   alleging  matrimonial    cruelty and     harassment

demanding dowry and criminal breach of trust by her husband

and his close relatives. After filing of the report indicting the

petitioners/accused for the offences stated supra, it is submitted,

the spouses have resolved their disputes and the wife/2nd

respondent is no longer interested in prosecuting the petitioners.

A decree for dissolution of the marriage of the spouses has been

passed by the competent Family Court on their mutual consent,

is the further submission, producing a certified copy of that

decree.

Crl.MC.No. 301 of 2012          2



      2.   Learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent also

endorses the submissions made by the counsel for the petitioners

that there has been a full and final settlement and the

continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioners,

in the aforesaid circumstances is not at all warranted. The Apex

Court in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108

(SC)] has held that criminal cases involving non-compoundable

offences where such offences are predominantly of civil flavour or

arising from matrimonial disputes, on settlement by the parties

thereto, can be quashed by this Court in exercise of its inherent

powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In

view of the settlement effected by the parties, it is also to be

taken note that even if the prosecution is continued against the

petitioners/accused chances of such prosecution leading to a

conviction of any of them are remote. At best, that may result

only in wastage of precious time of the Court. Taking into account

those aspects also, and the settlement effected by the parties, I

find, proceedings against the petitioners are liable to be quashed.

Crl.MC.No. 301 of 2012          3



    3.    Criminal proceedings against petitioners/accused in

C.C No.3009 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Irinjalakkuda are quashed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

    Criminal Miscellaneous Case is disposed of.

                Crl.M.C.No.3378 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
         Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014.


                          O R D E R

     The petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime

No.714/10 of Bakel Police station, Kasaragod District, in

which the offences involved are under section 328 of IPC,

preferred the above M.C. under section 482 of Cr.P.C. to

quash Annexure-I charge sheet and all further proceedings

in the above crime, which is now pending as LPC

No.52/2013 on the file of the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-II, Hosdurg, as the matter is settled with the de

facto complainant who is the 2nd respondent herein.

     2.  The gist of the allegation is that, on 8.10.2010, at

about 5 p.m., the petitioner poured poison in the water

tank of the de facto complainant and thereby committed

the offence as alleged.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent and the learned

                                    2

Public Prosecutor.

      4.    The offence alleged is that the accused poured

poison in the water tank of the de facto complainant, who is

the 2nd respondent herein who by filing Annexure-II affidavit

submitted that, she do not want to proceed with the

prosecution        against   the    petitioner     since      they are

neighbours. As I am satisfied with the reasons stated in the

accompanying affidavit and considering the fact that no

public interest is involved, I am of the view that, this

petition can be allowed, following the decision reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)],

in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a criminal     court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category

Crl.M.C.No.3378 of 2014
                                   3

         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases   having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,      financial,    mercandile,   civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused
         to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

      In the result, this M.C. is allowed quashing all further

proceedings in Crime No.714/10 of Bakel Police station,

Kasaragod District, which is now pending as LPC

No.52/2013 on the file of the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-II, Hosdurg.

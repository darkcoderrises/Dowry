                  Crl.M.C.No.3217 of 2012
         -------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 11th day of December, 2012

                           O R D E R




        Petitioner is the accused in a pending case on

the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-

I, Ernakulam. He is being prosecuted for the offence

punishable under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal

Code on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,

Palarivattom Police Station. Crime in the above case

was registered on a complaint given by his wife, 2nd

respondent,     alleging       matrimonial        cruelty   and

harassment by the husband demanding dowry. After

investigation of the crime indictment for the

aforesaid offence has been levelled against the

petitioner/husband. Now, the spouses have resolved

their matrimonial disputes and a decree                 severing

their marital tie has been passed on mutual consent

by the competent Family Court, is the submission of

Crl.M.C.No.3217 of 2012

                         :: 2 ::


the learned counsel for petitioner.     In view of the

settlement effected, the wife is no longer interested

in continuing with the prosecution of her former

husband, is the further submission. Second respondent

wife is also represented by a counsel who endorses the

submission made as above. An affidavit sworn to by

the 2nd respondent averring that she is not interested

in prosecuting the petitioner, her former husband, has

also been filed.

        2. Having regard to the submissions made and

taking note of the settlement effected by the parties,

I find, continuation of the criminal proceedings

against the petitioner/accused in the case is not

called for. The Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab {2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)} has held that where

offences arise from disputes of civil flavour or out of

matrimonial disputes, even if such offences are non-

compoundable, this court     can exercise its inherent

powers to quash the proceedings taking note of the

Crl.M.C.No.3217 of 2012

                         :: 3 ::


settlement effected by the parties.      Further more,

even if the prosecution proceedings are continued

against the petitioner, in view of the settlement, it

may result only in wastage of precious time of the

court.

        3.   Taking note of all the above aspects,

criminal   proceedings   against   the  petitioner in

C.C.No.4424 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial

Magistrate of the First Class-I, Ernakulam are

quashed, exercising the inherent powers of this court

under Section 482 of the Code.

        Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

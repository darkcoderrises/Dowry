            This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    The 1st petitioner is the defacto complainant and

petitioners 2 to 4 are the accused in Crime No.1573/2012 of

Kottiyam     Police      Station      registered        for    the     offences

punishable under Sections 323, 324 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR in Crime

No.1573/2012 of Kottiyam Police Station as against

petitioners 2 to 4, who are the husband, mother-in-law and

sister-in law of the 1st petitioner, and all further proceedings

Crl.M.C.87/2015
                              : 2 :



based on it pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Kollam, quashed.

      4.     The allegation against petitioners 2 to 4 is that

they had tortured and harassed the 1st petitioner and treated

her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by

demanding more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the 1st petitioner and petitioners 2 to 4 have

been amicably settled and presently, the 1st petitioner has

no complaints against petitioners 2 to 4 and, therefore, the

proceedings against petitioners 2 to 4 may be quashed.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against petitioners 2 to 4, it is only just

and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

Crl.M.C.87/2015

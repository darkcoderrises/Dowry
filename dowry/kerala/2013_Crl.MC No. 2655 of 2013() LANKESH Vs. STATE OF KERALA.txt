               Crl.M.C.No.2655 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013.


                         O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance   of  the     petitioner,     who     is accused in

S.T.No.1619/11 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Punalur, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No. 310/11 of Anchal Police Station] for

the offences punishable under Sections 341, 294(b) and

323 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 final

report and all proceedings pursuant to it in the above

summary trial case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.  The allegation in the above case is that on

24.3.2011 at about 7 p.m., the accused on account of

previous enmity wrongfully restrained the de facto

complainant and used abusive words against him and also

                             2
Crl.M.C.No.2655 of 2013


slapped on the left side of de facto complainant's face

with his hand and thereby caused pain to him and the

incident occurred at Road Junction in Thazhamel Muri,

Anchal Village. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court, as evident from Annexure

A2 affidavit dated 23.4.2013 sworn in by the 2nd

respondent.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that during the pendency of the above case,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5.    The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

                             3
Crl.M.C.No.2655 of 2013


further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against the petitioner.

         6.      I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341,

294(b) and 323 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved.        It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter.      From the

submission made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

                                   4
Crl.M.C.No.2655 of 2013


further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture,

it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-




                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of
         its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised     in accord    with    the   guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any Court. In what cases power to
         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or
         F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend
         on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising       from     commercial,      financial,
         mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

                                 5
Crl.M.C.No.2655 of 2013


         disputes where the wrong is basically private
         or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category
         of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim,
         the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would
         put accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to him
         by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with
         the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved  in   the   present     case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A1 final report and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioner in S.T.No.1619/11 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Punalur, in Crime

No.310/2011 of Anchal Police Station.

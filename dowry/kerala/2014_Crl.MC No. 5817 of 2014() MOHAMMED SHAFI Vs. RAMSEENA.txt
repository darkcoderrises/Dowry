                  ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
            =========================
                  Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014
         ============================
          Dated this the 15th day of October, 2014

                            ORDER



      The above Criminal Miscellaneous Case (Crl.M.C.) has been

filed with the prayer to quash all the further proceedings against

the petitioners in Crime No.796 of 2014 of Neeleshwaram Police

Station. The petitioners are the accused in Crime No.796 of 2014

of Neeleshwaram Police Station, which was registered on a

private complaint filed by the 1st respondent against the

petitioners for offence under Section 498A r/w Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code.

      2. The gist of the allegation is that the 1st respondent had

married the 1st petitioner and that they were living as husband

and wife and that the 1st petitioner treated her with cruelty with

the support of petitioners 2 to 4 and thereby committed the above

said offence. It is stated that the matter has now been settled

amicably and the de facto complainant does not want to proceed

with the criminal case. Annexure A2 is the agreement arrived at

between the parties reflecting the above said settlement. The 1st

respondent has sworn to an affidavit dated 23.09.2014, which is

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014           2



produced as Annexure A3 in this Crl.M.C, stating about the

above said facts and further stating that the matter has been

settled between her and the petitioners and that she received

Talaq from the 1st petitioner husband and an amount of

Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakh only) as all benefits under

Section 3 of the Muslim Women Protection on Divorce Act was

paid by the 1st petitioner to her and that she has executed the

agreement for the same and that she has no grievance against

the petitioners.      It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances that the aforementioned Crl.M.C has been filed.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.C.H.Abdul

Rasac has taken notice for the 1st respondent and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 2nd respondent-State

of Kerala.

      4.    Heard Sri.K.R.Avinash, the learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners, Sri.C.H.Abdul Rasac, learned counsel

appearing for 1st respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor

appearing for the 2nd respondent-State of Kearla.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned impugned

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014         3



criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of

the aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.C.H.Abdul Rasac, the learned counsel appearing

for the 1st respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 1st respondent that the 1st

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners

and that she has no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as

she has no grievance against them and that she will not raise any

dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014          4



also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offence alleged is more or less personal in nature and

not much element of public interest is involved. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, it is clear to the

court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Apex Court in the case between Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160,

para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein

the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [See

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014                 5



SCC (Cri)]:

                  "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.        In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
         facts and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
          offences          arising       from        commercial,
          financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
          the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
          criminal case would put accused to great oppression
          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
          and complete settlement and compromise with the
          victim........"

       Further, in the case Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another reported in (2013) 4 SCC

58 [see 2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)], the Apex Court has held as

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014                6



follows:-

                "8.    It is not in dispute that matrimonial
         disputes have been on considerable increase in recent
         times resulting in filing of complaints under Sections
         498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband
         but also against the relatives of the husband. The
         question is when such matters are resolved either by
         the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or
         by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for
         which both the sides approached the High Court and
         jointly   prayed   for   quashing     of   the   criminal
         proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under
         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer
         can be declined on the sole ground that since the
         offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of
         the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to
         quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                9. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand
         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint
         under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3
         and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the
         help and intervention of family members, friends and
         well-wishers, the parties concerned have amicably
         settled their differences and executed a compromise/
         settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the
         said compromise before the Trial Court with a request
         to place the same on record and to drop the criminal
         proceedings against the appellants herein. It is also
         not in dispute that in additional to the mutual
         settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife
         has also filed an affidavit stating that she did not wish
         to pursue the criminal proceedings against the
         appellants and fully supported the contents of the
         settlement deed. It is the grievance of the appellants
         that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of
         the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise
         its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on
         the ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the
         offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of
         IPC which are non-compoundable in nature.

                15. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to
         encourage     genuine    settlements    of   matrimonial
         disputes, particularly, when the same are on

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014               7



         considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes
         and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled
         the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold
         that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,
         Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the
         exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
         subsequent criminal proceedings.

                16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
         disputes in recent times. The institution of marriage
         occupies an important place and it has an important
         role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
         should be made in the interest of the individuals in
         order to enable them to settle down in life and live
         peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults
         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
         agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law,
         in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
         matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to
         state that the power under Section 482 should be
         exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
         when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material
         on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that
         the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought
         to be quashed."




         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the matrimonial disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014            8



parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure A1 FIR in Crime No.796 of 2014 of Neeleshwaram

Police Sation and all further proceedings arising therefrom

stands quashed.        The petitioners shall produce certified copies

Crl.M.C No.5817 of 2014         9



of this order before the court below concerned as well as before

the Station House Officer, Mankada Police Station.

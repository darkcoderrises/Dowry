                    B.A. No. 3482 of 2013
                -----------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R


     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure. Petitioner is the accused in Crime

No.622/2013 of the Thenmala Police Station registered

for the offence punishable under Section 498(A) of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

his wife, after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments

and money, by demanding more dowry and also

demanding resignation of the defacto complainant, who

is a ward member of the Thenmala Grama Panchayath.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.        The investigation of this

case is practically over. The custodial interrogation of

the petitioner is not required for the continued

investigation of this case. No criminal antecedents have

been reported against the petitioner. Matters being so, I

am satisfied that anticipatory bail can be granted to the

B.A. No. 3482 of 2013
                                 2

petitioner.

      4. In the result, this B.A. is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner is directed to

enlarge the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

his executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees Twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum

each to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions.

      (1) The        petitioner  shall report    before   the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

Wednesdays          and     Saturdays, commencing       from

12.06.2013 for a period of three months or till the filing of

the final report in this case, which ever is earlier.

      (2) The petitioner shall not tamper with the

evidence or influence witnesses.

      (3) The petitioner shall make himself available for

interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

Officer.

      (4) The petitioners shall not involve in any offence

B.A. No. 3482 of 2013
                           3

while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

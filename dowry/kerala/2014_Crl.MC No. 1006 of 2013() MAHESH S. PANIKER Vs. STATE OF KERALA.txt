            -------------------------------------------
                    Crl.M.C. No.1006 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 21st day of February, 2014

                             ORDER

     This petition is filed U/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash all

proceedings in C.C.No.540/2012 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate    Court-II,   Perinthalmanna.        Petitioners are

accused in the above case, which was charge sheeted

U/s.498A r/w 34 IPC by the Sub Inspector of Police,

Mankada. The 2nd respondent filed the above case alleging

that the 1st petitioner, who is a blind, married the 2nd

respondent on 10.5.2009 as per customary rites. At that

time, 30 sovereigns of gold ornaments were worn by her.

The 1st petitioner is a post graduate and working as

Professor in Political Science in Lady Sri. Ram College for

Women, New Delhi. While they were residing together, the

1st petitioner ill-treated her both physically and mentally

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13              2

demanding more amount as dowry. The other petitioners

were also ill-treated her demanding more amount. In the

circumstances, she left the matrimonial home and filed the

above complaint.      On the basis of that complaint, Sub

Inspector of Police, Mankada police station registered the

above crime and after investigation laid charge before

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Perinthalmanna. In

the circumstances, the petitioners have approached this

court to quash the proceeding in the above case by

invoking the inherent jurisdiction.

      2.    The    learned   counsel    appearing   for  the

petitioners contended that the 2nd respondent is very poor

and she has no financial background to pay any amount or

gold. Considering that aspect, the 1st petitioner married

her. The 1st petitioner is a visually disabled person and his

mother is a cancer patient and there was no occasion for

any ill-treatment as alleged by the 2nd respondent.

According to the petitioners, she is short tempered and

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13             3

does not listen the words of elders and other family

members and she is very adamant in nature. She always

gets angry, uses abusive language against the elders. She

also shows disinterest in doing household work and she

neglected her basic responsibility at her matrimonial

home. In the circumstances, she cheated the 1st petitioner

and deserted him and living with her parents. No incident

as alleged in the complaint was occurred. There was no

ill-treatment or any cruel behaviour was occurred from the

side of the petitioners. All the allegations are false and

hence it is necessary to interfere in this matter by invoking

the inherent jurisdiction.

       3.   The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent strongly resisted the above contention and

contended that the allegations, prima facie, show a case

against the petitioners.   The 1st petitioner is a visually

disabled person and the 2nd respondent believed that he

will look after her in her family life. She accepted the

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13                   4

proposal with great expectation. Finally, when she was

living with the 1st petitioner in New Delhi, she was ill-

treated by him.       Therefore, this is not a fit case to invoke

the inherent jurisdiction.

      4.    According to Section 482 Cr.P.C. the inherent

powers can be invoked for the three grounds mentioned

thereunder. It can be used to make such orders as may

be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or

to prevent abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to

secure ends of justice.            In the State of Haryana v.

Bhajanlal, the Supreme Court pointed out that: [1992 SCC

(Crl) 426]

             "(1) Where the allegations in the FIR/complaint,
      even if they are taken at their face value do not prima
      facie constitute any offence against the accused. (2)
      Where the allegations in the FIR of other materials do
      not constitute a cognizable offence justifying an
      investigation by the police under Section 156(1) of the
      code except under an order of a Magistrate within the
      purview     of  Section   155(2).    (3)   Where     the
      uncontroverted allegations in the FIR/complaint and
      the evidence collected thereon do not disclose the
      commission of any offence. (4) Where the allegations
      in the FIR/complaint do not constitute any cognizable
      offence but constitute only non-cognizable offence to
      which no investigation is permitted by the police
      without the order of Magistrate under Section 155(2).

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13                    5

       (5) Where the allegations are so absurd and inherently
       improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
       can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient
       ground for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where
       there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
       provisions of the Code or the Statute concerned
       (under which the proceeding is instituted) to the
       institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or
       where there is a specific provision in the code or in the
       statute concerned, providing efficacious redress for
       the grievance of the aggrieved party. (7) Where a
       criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
       fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously
       instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
       vengeance on the accuse with a view to spite him due
       to private and personal vengeance.

      5.     The facts and circumstances in this case show

that there was allegation of ill-treatment by the 1st

petitioner against the 2nd respondent. Petitioners 1 to 4

demanded more dowry and gold ornaments from the 2nd

respondent.        Moreover, they informed her that the 1st

petitioner will get more beautiful lady as wife.                 In the

circumstances, the 2nd respondent forced to get asylum in

her parental house. Now she is residing with her parents.

The petitioners have produced a petition filed by the 2nd

respondent at the Mankada Police station, along with

Annexure-A4.            They     have       have     also      produced

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13               6

Annexure-A5 scanning report and Annexure-A6 diary

notes of the 2nd respondent.        Annexure-A7 is the final

report in the above crime. Considering the allegation, I am

of the view that prima facie case is made out against the

petitioners. If that be so, this is not a fit case to invoke the

inherent jurisdiction.

      6.    While exercising inherent powers, this Court

has no right to analyze the evidence, which is the

responsibility of the trial court. Therefore, accepting the

legal principle, I am of the view that inherent jurisdiction

cannot be exercised in this case.       However, the learned

counsel for the petitioners submits that the 1st petitioner is

a blind and the 3rd petitioner is a cancer patient.

Therefore, he seeks exemption from personal appearance

in the trial court during trial. Annexure-A2 is the treatment

certificate of the 3rd petitioner. Annexure-A2 shows that

she is under treatment of Amrita Institute of Medical

Sciences and Research Centre, Kochi.             If that be the

Crl.M.C.No.1006/13             7

position, any application for exemption from personal

appearance of the 3rd petitioner is filed, the learned

Magistrate shall consider that application and do the

needful.      With regard to the other petitioners, they are

directed to appear before the trial court. It is also directed

that if any petition in support of their defence for

discharging or further exemption is filed, the learned

Magistrate shall pass appropriate orders in accordance

with law.

      Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.

            ---------------------------------------
               Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014
           ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 24th day of June, 2014

                            ORDER


      This is an application filed by the accused in C.C.

No.1704/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Kasaragod, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioner has been

arrayed as accused in Crime No. 1121/2012 of Kasaragod

Police Station, which was registered on the basis of the

statement   given   by  the second      respondent, de    facto

complainant, alleging commission of the offence under

Sections 294 (b) and 324 of Indian Penal Code as Annexure I

First Information Report was registered and after investigation

Annexure II final report was filed which was taken on file as

C.C. No. 1704/2013 and it is now pending before Judicial First

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014                2


Class Magistrate Court I, Kasaragod.             In the meantime, the

matter has been settled between the parties. In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction as well.

Since the offences are non compoundable in nature, they could

not file the application before the concerned court to record

compounding. So the petitioner has no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief.

        To call for the records leading to the case and quash all

        further proceedings in CC No. 1704/2013 on the files of

        Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Kasaragod.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and it was due to some misunderstanding that the complaint

was filed and due to the intervention of well wishers of both

parties, the misunderstanding has been resolved and their

relationship had been restored and he does not want to

prosecute the petitioner.         He had filed Annexure V affidavit

stating these facts.

      4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view

of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and he

prayed for allowing the application.

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014         3


      5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner, but opposed the application.

      6.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant, the second

respondent, Annexure I First Information Report was registered

as Crime No. 1121/2012 of Kasaragod Police Station against

the Driver of Auto rickshaw with No. KL 14C 9545 and after

investigation, it was revealed that the present petitioner was

the Driver at the relevant time and accordingly he has been

implicated as accused and after investigation Annexure II final

report was filed against the petitioner alleging commission of

the offence under Sections 294(b) and 324 of the Indian Penal

Code before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Kasaragod

and the learned Magistrate had taken cognizance of the case

and that is now pending as C.C. No. 1704/2013 before that

Court. It is also seen from the allegations in the petition and

Annexure V affidavit filed by the de facto complainant that due

to the intervention of mediators and well wishers of both

parties, the matter has been settled between them and their

relationship has been restored and he has no grievance against

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014             4


the petitioner now. Even going through the allegations in the

First Information Statement as well as the final report, the

allegations are not sufficient to attract the offence under

Section 294 (b) of Indian Penal Code. Considering the fact that

matter has been settled between the parties, there is no

possibility of conviction as neither the de facto complainant nor

his witnesses will support the case of the prosecution, if the

case is allowed to proceed with and it will be only a wastage of

judicial time. Further, there is no public interest involved in the

case and the private dispute between the parties has resulted

in registration of the crime and filing of the final report. If the

same is settled between the parties due to the intervention of

mediators, then Court must honour such settlement to

promote harmony between the parties.

      7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The   position that   emerges    from    the   above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High

      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or

      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

      and different from the power given to a criminal court for

      compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014              5



      limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

      guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

      any Court.    In what cases power to quash the criminal

      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where

      the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

      no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise

      of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the

      nature and gravity of the crime.      Heinous and serious

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have

      serious impact on society.      Similarly, any compromise

      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or

      the offences committed by public servants while working in

      that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

      criminal proceedings involving such offences.       But the

      criminal   cases     having   overwhelmingly     and    pre-

      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or

      such like transactions or the offences arising out of

      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes

      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this

      category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

      between the offender and victim, the possibility of

      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014              6



      case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

      and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

      settlement and compromise with the victim.           In other

      words, the High Court must consider whether it would be

      unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

      the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

      despite settlement and compromise between the victim

      and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,

      it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if

      the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the

      High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the

      criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the decision stated

supra and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and it is a private dispute which

resulted in the registration of the crime and no purpose will be

served by allowing the case to continue as conviction of such

cases will be remote, this Court feels that it is a fit case where

the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the

settlement and harmony that has been restored between the

parties and pendency of this case could not be a hurdle for the

same.

Crl.M.C. No. 3206 of 2014            7


              So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C. No. 1704/2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate -I, Kasaragod. as against the petitioner is quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order with the

concerned Court immediately for necessary further action in

this regard.

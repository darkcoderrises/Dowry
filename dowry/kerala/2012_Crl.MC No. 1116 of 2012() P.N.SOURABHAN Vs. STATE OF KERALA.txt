                   -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 1st day of August, 2012

                             O R D E R



      A short but interesting question emerges for consideration

on the challenges raised in the aforesaid Crl.M.C. filed under

Section 482 of the Code to assail Annexure VIII order passed by

the     Additional     Chief       Judicial       Magistrate Court,

Thiruvananthapuram.



      2. Facts in brief, to the extent necessary for disposal of this

petition, can be summed up thus:

      1st petitioner is the father, and the 2nd petitioner, his

daughter. Matrimonial disputes of the 2nd petitioner with her

husband led to registering of two crime cases at Pettah Police

station, Thiruvananthapuram. Crime No.621 of 2011 arose from

a complaint filed by the father-in-law of the 2nd petitioner against

her father (1st petitioner) alleging of his criminal trespass upon

the residential building of the de facto complainant and

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             2



assaulting him and other members of his family with a deadly

weapon causing them grave injuries. The other crime, Crime

No.637 of 2011 arose on a complaint given by the 2nd petitioner

against her husband, his parents and close relatives, imputing of

matrimonial cruelty demanding dowry and of assault on her

person causing grievous hurt. Sub Inspector of Police, Pettah

Police Station, after conducting investigation in both the crimes,

laid reports under Section 173 (2) of the Code before the court

indicting the accused persons in the respective case. In Crime

No.621 of 2011, wherein, the 1st petitioner is the accused, report

was filed indicting him of the offences punishable under Sections

447, 323, 324 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code. Cognizance

being taken of the offences, committal proceedings of the case

commenced numbering the case as C.P.No.46 of 2011 on the file

of    the      Additional Chief    Judicial  Magistrate     Court,

Thiruvananthpauram. In the other case, Crime No.637 of 2011,

cognizance being taken on the report filed for the offences

imputed against the accused persons under Sections 498A and

324 read with Section 34 of the IPC, the case was numbered as

C.C.No.631 of 2011 on the file of the above court.          When

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012            3



matters stood thus, the Assistant Commissioner of Police,

Cantonment Sub Division, Thiruvananthapuram City, moved

Annexure VII petition before the Magistrate seeking permission

for further investigation in both the cases.        The learned

Magistrate granted permission to conduct further investigation

in the two crime cases vide Annexure VIII order. Annexure VIII

order is challenged by the petitioners as illegal, without

jurisdiction and an abuse of process of the court.



      3. The de facto complainant in Crime No.621 of 2011 has

got impleaded as additional 2nd respondent in the petition. He

has filed a counter with some documents opposing the challenge

against Annexure VIII order.



      4.     The     learned counsel     for   the   petitioners,

Sri.Pirappancode V.S.Sudheer confined his submissions solely

over the question of competency of the Police Officer, Assistant

Commissioner of Police, Cantonment Sub Division to seek

permission from the court for further investigation of the two

crimes, in which, final reports had already been filed before the

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             4



court.     The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that

Pettah Police Station does not fall within the local area covered

by the Cantonment Sub Division, Thiruvananthapuram but it is

within a different Sub Division, namely, Shangumugham Sub

Division. When that be so, the Assistant Commissioner of Police,

Cantonment Sub Division, who cannot be considered as a

Superior Police Officer in relation to the Station House Officer of

Pettah Police Station, is incompetent to move for further

investigation of the crime even if he is a Superior Officer of the

Station House Officer of the above Station, submits the counsel.

That challenge is resisted to by the learned Director General of

Prosecutions, Sri.T.Asaf Ali banking upon the supervisory

authority of the Director General of Police and his empowerment

to entrust the investigation of the crime to a Police officer above

the rank of the Station House Officer. Section 18 (1) of the

Kerala Police Act, 2011 confers such authority on the Director

General of Police, State Chief, and it is on the basis of his orders,

further investigation of the crimes was taken over by the

Assistant Commissioner of Police, Cantonment Sub Division, who

had later moved Annexure VII order before the court to seek

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012               5



permission for further investigation, is the submission of the

Director General of Prosecutions.        Section 36 of the Code

empowering a superior police officer above the rank of Station

House Officer to conduct investigation of the crime, is also

canvassed by the learned Director General of Prosecutions to

contend that the challenge against Annexure VIII order is

without any merit. Reliance is also placed on State of Bihar

and Another v. J.A.C. Saldanha and Others (1980 SCC

(Cri.) 272) to contend that the power of superintendence

conferred with Police Chief would comprehend the power to

exercise effective control over the investigation of the crime as

well and also empowerment to depute any superior police officer

above the rank of the Station House Officer in conducting of

investigation of one or more crimes. Supporting the arguments

canvassed by the learned Director General of Prosecutions, the

learned      counsel     for   the   additional 2nd   respondent,

Sri.K.K.Dheerendrakrishnan contended that the Police Officer,

who applied for permission to conduct further investigation of

the crimes was fully empowered to do so as authorised by the

Police Chief.       Additional 2nd respondent has filed a petition

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             6



pointing out serious lapses in the investigation of the crimes, and

being satisfied of the cause shown, the Police Chief ordered to

take steps for further investigation entrusting the conducting of

such investigation to the Assistant Commissioner of Police,

Cantonment Sub Division.       Copies of the petition filed and

communication sent by the Police Chief, produced by the

additional 2nd respondent, are relied by the counsel to contend

that the Police Officer, who moved Annexure VII petition before

the court, has full authority to do so, and Annexure VIII order

passed by the learned Magistrate granting permission for further

investigation      in the crimes,   in  such   circumstances,    is

unassailable.



      5.    Power to investigate a crime by a Police Officer is

regulated by the provisions of the Code. Whether a Police officer

has requisite jurisdiction to investigate a crime or not will

depend upon a large number of factors including those relating

to 'Jurisdiction of the Criminal Courts In Inquiries and Trials' as

under Chapter XIII of the Code. There is no dispute that Pettah

Police Station is within Shangumugham Sub Division which is

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             7



under the supervisory control of the Assistant Commissioner of

that Division. Assistant Commissioner, Cantonment Sub Division

has no superintendence or supervisory control over Pettah Police

Station which falls within a different Sub Division is conceded to.

When that be so, the question emerges for consideration

whether the Police Chief by an executive order empower or

confer authority on a Superior Police Officer to investigate a

crime registered in a local area, over which, he has no

jurisdiction. Neither Section 36 of the Code nor Section 18 (1) of

the Police Act can render any assistance in taking a view as

contended by the Director General for Prosecutions that the

Police Chief has authority to entrust the investigation to any

superior Police Officer of his choice over the investigation of a

crime. No doubt, it is open to the State, and, if such power is

delegated to the Police Chief, then, he can also constitute a

special team of police officers to investigate a crime registered

at a station, empowering such team to do so, but, to entrust a

Superior Police officer to investigate a crime, it has to be shown

that he has jurisdictional authority to conduct such investigation.

Otherwise the result will be calamitous, not only for the reason

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012                   8



it is done without statutory backing but even flouting the

provisions of the Code. If by executive order of Police Chief,

investigation of the case could be taken over and entrusted with

any person of his choice, then, fairness of investigation will be

open to serious doubt.          If a Police Officer is entrusted with

investigation of crime registered at a different station which

does not fall under the local area over which he has jurisdictional

authority, for the reason that such Officer is superior in rank to

the Station House Officer, it is patently unsustainable, as not

sanctioned by law.         Section 18 (1) of the Police Act cannot

override the statutory provisions covered by the Code which

govern and confer power to the Police officer to investigate

crime. Section 18 (1) of the Police Act reads thus:



             [18. State Police Chief:-
             (1) The administration, supervision, direction and
             control of the Police throughout the State shall,
             subject to the control of the Government, be vested
             in an officer designated as the State Police Chief.


Power of superintendence conferred on the Police Chief, by no

stretch of imagination, can override the statutory interdiction in

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012                    9



the matter of investigation by a Police officer as prescribed

under the Code. Section 36 of the Code also does not enable any

or all Superior Police Officers above the rank of the Officer in

charge of the police station to exercise the same powers of the

officer in charge of the police station. Section 36 of the Code

reads thus:



              36. Powers of superior officers of police:-
              Police officers superior in rank to an officer in
              charge of a police station may exercise the same
              powers, throughout the local area to which they
              are appointed, as may be exercised by such officer
              within the limits of his station.



That Section empowers the Police officers superior in rank to an

officer in charge of police station to exercise the powers of such

officer in charge of a police station in the local area to which

they are appointed. A Superior Police Officer of a different Sub

Division, by an executive order of the Police Chief, cannot

exercise the powers of the Officer in charge of the police station

if that station does not fall within the local area to which he has

been appointed.          In Saldanha's case, referred to above,

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             10



challenge against further investigation entrusted to a Superior

Police Officer was negatived taking note that such Police officer

enjoyed jurisdiction extending over the whole of the State, and in

that circumstance it was held that the power of the State

Government to employ him as Police Officer is unquestionable.

It is true that power of superintendence enjoyed by the Police

Chief would comprehend authority to give directions, guidance

and instructions to perform the duty in a certain manner. That

Executive power is untrammelled by judicial authority also, is

not open to doubt. However if executive order flagrantly flouts

jurisdictional conferment it is a different matter. Where it is

seen that after cognizance of the offences is taken by the court,

executive authority has bypassed the statutory prescriptions, to

entrust further investigation of a crime to an Officer who is not

having jurisdiction to do so, it cannot be overlooked, nor be

meekly accepted, on a premise that permission for further

investigation in a crime is formal. Challenge against Annexure

VIII order, in the aforesaid circumstances, has to be upheld since

permission has been applied by a Police Officer, who is shown to

be not having jurisdictional conferment for investigating the

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             11



crimes.



      6.     Communication sent by the Police Chief directing

entrustment        of further investigation  with   the Assistant

Commissioner of Police, Cantonment Sub Division was based on

a representation filed by the 2nd respondent - de facto

complainant in one of the crimes and one among the accused in

the other. No enquiry over the representation is seen to have

been conducted. Annexure VII petition filed by the Assistant

Commissioner of Police, Cantonment Sub Division, who was

ordered to conduct further investigation, spell out that after

going through the case diary, he found some lapses over the

investigation conducted in the crimes. On that basis he applied

to the court for further investigation of the crime. Solely on the

representation of the additional 2nd respondent, without anything

more, even without looking into the materials already collected

in the investigation of the two crimes, a Superior Police officer

was appointed ordering him to conduct further investigation of

the crimes. Whether such Police officer appointed and posted

over a different local area could be appointed so for conducting

Crl.M.C.No.1116/2012             12



further investigation, was also not examined. Application moved

for further investigation (Annexure VII) by the Assistant

Commissioner of Police, Cantonment Sub Division, when he has

no jurisdictional authority to investigate the crimes, on the basis

of communication entrusting further investigation to him, could

not have been entertained. Annexure VIII order passed by the

learned Magistrate passed on Annexure VII application is

unsustainable, and it is quashed invoking the inherent

jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the Code.



      Crl.M.C. is allowed.

    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1804 of 2013
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 21st day of March, 2014.




                           O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the

accused in C.C.No.724/11 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pala, to quash proceedings recording

compounding under Section 482            of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant second

respondent herein, Annexure A crime was registered as Crime

No.337/11 against the petitioner alleging offences under

Sections 451, 341 and 294(b) of Indian Penal Code.         After

investigation, final report was filed and the case was taken on

file as C.C.No.724/11 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pala and the case is now pending before that

court. In the meantime, the matter has been settled between

the parties and Annexure C settlement was arrived at between

the parties and the de facto complainant had decided to

withdraw the complaint against the petitioner. In view of the

Crl.M.C.No.1804 of 2013       :  2 :

settlement, no purpose will be served in proceeding with the

case. Since some of the offences are non-compoundable in

nature, no petition can be filed before the court below to

record compounding and the petitioner has no other remedy

except to approach this court seeking the following relief:

             "To quash Annexure A final report and all further

      proceedings in C.C.No.724/2011 on the files of Judicial

      First Class Magistrate Court, Pala arising from Crime

      No.337/2011 of Ramapuram Police Station to secure

      the ends of justice and to avoid the abuse of process"



      3.     Second respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that matter has been settled between the parties

and Annexure C agreement was entered into between the

parties regarding this aspect and he does not want to

prosecute the petitioner as the difference of opinion between

them has been resolved due to settlement. The Counsel for

the petitioner submitted that in view of the settlement, no

purpose will be served in proceeding with the case.

      4.     Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioner and he has no criminal background but

opposed the application.

Crl.M.C.No.1804 of 2013        :  3 :

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement      given   by   the   second     respondent    de   facto

complainant, Ramapuram police has registered a case as

Crime No.337/11 against the petitioner alleging offences under

Section 451, 341 and 294(b) of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.724/11 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Pala and it is pending before that court.           Now, the

matter has been settled between the parties which is evident

from Annexure C settlement. The offences alleged are not that

serious and also it cannot be said to be a crime involving public

interest. But, it is a dispute between two individuals which

resulted in the registering of the crime which has been settled

between the parties.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

Crl.M.C.No.1804 of 2013         :  4 :

      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute    would    depend   on   the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.             Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.M.C.No.1804 of 2013     :  5 :




      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and conviction in such cases will be

remote on account of the settlement, this court feels that it is

a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.724/11 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Pala as against the petitioner is quashed.      Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned

magistrate court immediately.

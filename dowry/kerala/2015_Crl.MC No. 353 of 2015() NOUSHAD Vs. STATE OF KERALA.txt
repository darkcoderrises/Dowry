               ===================
                CRL.M.C. No.353 of 2015
               ====================
           Dated this the 29th day of January, 2015

                         O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.86 of 2012 of the

Thadiyittaparambu Police Station, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A2 Final Report in

Crime No.86 of 2012 of the Thadiyittaparambu Police

Station, and all further proceedings based on it, in

C.C.No.1167 of 2012 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Perumbavoor, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

CRL.M.C.No.353 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,  who is      the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

CRL.M.C.No.353 of 2015
                                -: 3 :-



complainant on her own volition.

      7. Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A2

Final     Report    in  Crime      No.86         of    2012  of   the

Thadiyittaparambu       Police      Station        and    all further

proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.1167 of 2012 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,

Perumbavoor, are hereby quashed.

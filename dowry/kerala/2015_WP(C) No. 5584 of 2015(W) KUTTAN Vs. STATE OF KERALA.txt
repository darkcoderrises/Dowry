                     =========================
                          W.P.(C)No.5584 of 2015
                     =========================
                     Dated this the 4th day of August, 2015

                                 JUDGMENT


      The petitioner herein is the defacto complainant in S.C.No.436 of 2008,

before the Additional Assistant Sessions Judge, Thrissur.         The offences

alleged in the final reported submitted by the police are under Sections 498A

and 306 IPC.      The petitioner now wants further investigation on the

allegation that the offence under Section 304(B) IPC is revealed by the

materials, and so the police should have submitted final report under Section

304(B) IPC, instead of Section 306 IPC. On hearing the learned counsel, and

on a perusal of the original complaint that led to the crime, I find nothing

definite to attract Section 304(B) IPC. Just because the deceased had been

mentally or physically harassed within a period of seven years on a demand

for dowry, prosecution cannot be brought under Section 304(B) IPC. For a

prosecution under Section 304(B) IPC, there must be a definite case that

soon before the death the deceased had been subjected to cruelty on a

demand for more dowry, and ornaments. Such harassment soon before the

death is the essential ingredient of Section 304(B) IPC. In this case, in the

complaint made by the complainant, I do not find such allegations. I find

that there is no scope in this case for a further investigation into the offence

under Section 304(B) IPC. Abatment of Commission of suicide by acts of

W.P.(C)No.5584 of 2015
                                      2

cruelty including persistent demand for dowry and ornaments will even

otherwise come under Section 306 IPC. To come under Section 304(B) IPC,

something more is required. It appears that the petitioner seeks a direction

for further investigation into the offence under Section 304(B) IPC simply on

the ground that the death occurred within seven years. I find that this writ

petition is meritless.

       In the result, this writ petition is dismissed in limine, without being

admitted to files.

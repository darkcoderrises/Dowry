            -------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No. 3284 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 6th day of February, 2014

                             ORDER

      This criminal petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

to quash Annexure-1 final report in RC 9(A)/2004, which is

pending        before       Special        Court       (SPE/CBI),

Thiruvananthapuram as C.C.No.40/2011.

      2.   The above case was charge sheeted by CBI

alleging offence punishable U/s.120B r/w Ss.420, 465, 471

IPC and Sec.13(2) r/w 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption

Act. The petitioner is the 2nd accused in the above case,

which was charge sheeted by the CBI against 8 persons

including the bank officials. The petitioner is the Managing

partner of M/s. J.J. Exports, Changanassery and he availed

different loans from State Bank of Travancore, Main Branch,

Kottayam and also opened different accommodation Lcs with

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13            2

the help of accused Nos. 1 and 8 and sustained a loss of

Rs.2,58,33,385/- to the bank and thereby committed the

aforesaid offences. In the meantime, accused remitted

the entire due amount in the bank and settled the dispute

with them. Hence, the petitioner, who is the 2nd accused,

approached this Court to quash Annexure-A1 by invoking

inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

      3.    Heard both sides.      The learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner contended that while the

matter is pending consideration by the CBI Court, the

entire due amount was remitted by the petitioner and as

per the direction of the Debt Recovery Tribunal now the

matter is compromised and no purpose will be served in

proceeding with Annexure-A1. He produced Annexure-II

letter of SBT addressing to the CBI.

      4.    The learned counsel appearing for CBI strongly

resisted the above contention and contended that even

though the due amount is remitted, the criminal action

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13            3

committed by the responsible public servant cannot be

condoned.         The offence under the Prevention of

Corruption Act committed by the public servant especially

responsible bank officer working in that official capacity

cannot be quashed in the light of settled legal principle.

Even though he repaid the entire amount in the bank, that

will not provide any basis for quashing the aforesaid

proceedings.

      5.    Now the question that arises for consideration is

whether Annexure-A1 is to be quashed by invoking the

inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The inherent

powers of the High Court contemplated u/s 482 Cr.P.C.

has to be exercised only for the three purposes mentioned

in the Section. This power cannot be invoked naturally in

a matter where it is covered by a specific provision of the

code. Therefore it means that if the matter in question is

not covered by any provision of the code, it comes into

operation, for the three purposes mentioned in the section.

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13             4

Inherent jurisdiction to make such orders necessary to

"give effect to any order" under this code or to prevent

"abuse of the process" of any court or to secure "the ends

of justice". Apex Court in Talab Haji Hussain V. Madhukar

Purushotham Mondker (AIR 1958 SC 376) held that the

inherent power contemplated under Section 482 Cr.P.C

has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution

and only where such exercise is justified by the test

specifically laid down in the section itself. In the State of

Haryana V. Bhajanlal, the Supreme Court pointed out that:

      "where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are

so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no

prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is

sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, the

proceedings are liable to be quashed".

      6.    The specific case of the petitioner was that he

was charge sheeted by the CBI and he is the 2nd accused

in the above case. He settled the entire dispute between

his firm and the bank and Annexure-II is the letter issued

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13              5

from the bank to the CBI Court.         In Annexure-II, it is

reported that the loan availed by M/s. J.J. Exports has

been closed by the Company under a compromise

settlement. In such a situation, the case in DRT against

the Company has been withdrawn and they released the

charge over the properties mortgaged with the bank.        In

Annexure-III      order passed   by   the   DRT, recorded

satisfaction of the R.C. for Rs.84,10,000/- and DRC

No.3023 was recalled and directed to return the title

deeds, tax receipt and encumbrance certificate produced

to the counsel for the bank, after closing the transaction by

the recovery officer. But, it is pertinent to note that while

the 1st accused was functioning as AGM, SBT Main

Branch, Kottayam during 2002-2003, entered into a

criminal conspiracy along with the 2nd accused and the

other accused with intention to cheat SBT, Main Branch,

Kottayam and in furtherance of that, A1 and A8 abusing

their official position as public servants, dishonestly and

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13               6

sanctioned LC facility to the 2nd accused in the name of

J.J. Exports. In the export business, they credited cash

credit accounts in the name of Coromondal Foot Wears

India (P) Ltd., Changanassery. The bank officials colluded

with the accused persons and permitted them to open LC

without complying with all the statutory formalities issued

by the Bank and thereby sustained huge loss to the bank

and committed the offence.

      7.    It is clear from Annexure-II report that they had

committed serious offence by misappropriating the public

money, which was against the bank regulations. Now the

contention of the petitioner was that he settled the

transaction with the bank and by invoking inherent power,

charge against him is to be quashed.

      8.    Now     the    question remains      is   whether

repayment of the due amount is a ground to close the

criminal     proceedings    against  the   public    servants

especially when a serious crime was charge sheeted

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13                  7

against them under Prevention of Corruption Act.              It is

true that the officers of the bank are public servants

working in that official capacity in a public institution. The

Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT

108(SC)] held that when any compromise between the

victim and the offender in relation to the offences under

the special status like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

offence committed by the public servants while working in

that official capacity cannot be provided for any basis for

quashing criminal proceedings involving such offence. In

paragraph 57 of the above decision, the apex court

considered the parameters under which circumstances a

criminal proceedings can be quashed by invoking inherent

jurisdiction, which reads as follows:

       "..... Similarly any compromise between the victim
       and offender in relation to the offences under special
       status like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
       offence committed by public servants while working
       in that capacity etc. cannot provide for any basis for
       quashing    criminal   proceedings    involving such
       offences.       But   the    criminal  case    having
       overwhelming and pre-dominantly civil flavour stand
       on different footing for the purpose of quashing,

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13                  8

       particularly the offences arising from commercial,
       financial, mercantile, civil, parnership or such like
       transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
       relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where
       the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute.

In the above decision, the Apex Court considered the

earlier decisions in B.S. Joshi & ors v. State of Hariyana &

anr. [2003(2) KLT 1062SC)], Nikhil Merchant v. CBI & anr.

[2008(3) KLT 769(SC)], Manoj Sharma v. State and others

[2008(4) KLT 417(SC)] and Sushil Suri v. CBI & anr. [2011

(2) KLT SN 113 (case No.136)]. Relied R.P. Kapur v.

State of Punjab [1960 SC 866] and Madhu Limaye v. The

State of Maharashtra [ (1997) 4 SCC 551]. All these are

guidelines issued by the Apex Court for quashing criminal

proceedings by invoking the inherent powers under

Section 482 Cr.P.C.

      11. Therefore, the facts and circumstances in this

case show that the offence committed by the petitioner is

a serious one. Even though he repaid the amount in the

bank and the bank issued a report to the CBI Court, that

Crl.M.C.No.3284/13               9

itself is not a ground to quash Annexure-1 proceedings. I

think that the parameters of the above legal principles will

not attract the facts and circumstances of this case.

      Therefore, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to

invoke the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

and accordingly, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. However, the

petitioner is at liberty to take all his defence before the trial

court.

                   Bail Appl.No. 3680      of 2008
                 ------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 9th day of June, 2008.


                                 ORDER



           Petition for anticipatory bail.

           2. According to prosecution, petitioners 2 to 6 are accused

numbers 2 to 6 in the crime. They along with first accused went to the

house of de facto complainant and demanded dowry of Rs.50,000/- to

be given for the marriage which was to take place on 8.3.2008. They

also threatened that the marriage would not take place as agreed, if

they did not pay the money.

           3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

first accused's marriage was fixed with the de facto complainant's

daughter,   and it was to take place on 8.3.2008.          But, after the

engagement, first accused was informed by one Chandra that he is in

love with the de facto complainant's daughter and also threatened him

not to marry her. He expressed his willingness to marry the girl. (The

details of the said Chandran with the          address are given in the

petition). Hence, the proposed marriage fizzled out.

      4. Petitioners 2 to 6 are the close relatives of the first accused.

[B.A.3680/08]                        2

They have not committed any offence as alleged, but only because

the marriage did not take place in the circumstances narrated, a false

complaint is now foisted against the petitioners alleging demand of

dowry, it is submitted. First petitioner is missing and not available.

        4.    On hearing both sides, I am inclined to grant anticipatory

bail to the petitioners and the following order is passed.

          (i) Petitioners shall surrender before the investigating officer

within 10 days from the date of this order and make themselves

available for interrogation.

          (ii) In the event of arrest of the petitioners, they shall be

produced before the Magistrate Court concerned and on production,

they shall be released on bail on their executing bond for Rs.25,000/-

each with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction

of the Court on condition that they shall report before the

investigating officer as and when directed and co-operate with the

investigation.

             Petition is allowed.




                                                  K. HEMA, JUDGE.

Krs.

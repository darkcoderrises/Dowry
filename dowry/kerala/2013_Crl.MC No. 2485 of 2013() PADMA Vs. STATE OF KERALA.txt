                Crl.M.C.No.2485 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of June, 2013.


                         O R D E R

        The petitioner who is a lady is the 2nd accused in

Crime No.129/06 of Adoor police station. The allegation in

the above crime is that the accused therein, including the

petitioner, demanding       dowry     subjected  the defacto

complainant to physical and mental harassment and thus

the accused two in numbers committed the offences under

section 498 A and 34 of IPC. On completing the

investigation, the police preferred a report on the basis of

which    cognizance      was      taken      and  accordingly

C.C.No.337/06 was instituted by the court of Judicial First

Class Magistrate-I, Adoor. The petitioner as well as the

other accused faced the trial and when the case was posted

for judgment on 29.4.2013, the petitioner disappeared.

Consequently, the learned Magistrate proceeded with the

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.2485 of 2013


case and convicted the other accused, ie., the 1st accused

who is the husband of the de facto complainant.

      2. Now the case of the petitioner is that she was a

permanent resident of Maharashtra and she went to

Maharashtra on 29.4.2013 and as such, she could not

receive the judgment of the trial court in C.C.No.337/06

and now the case against her was split up and pending as

C.C.No.974/13, in which the court below issued NBW

against her. Therefore, she preferred this petition under

section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a prayer to direct the court of

Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Adoor, to consider her

bail application and to grant bail on the date of her

surrender itself in C.C.No.974/13.

      3.    Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, which I mentioned earlier, it can be

seen that the petitioner disappeared from the court and

the jurisdiction of the trial court on 29.4.2013, the date

on which C.C.No.337/06 was posted for judgment. It is

                               3
Crl.M.C.No.2485 of 2013


also beyond dispute that the other accused in the said

case were convicted for the offences punishable under

section 498 A r/w 34 of IPC and sentenced them to

undergo imprisonment for 3 years and to pay fine of

`3,000/- and in default of payment, to undergo simple

imprisonment for 3 months.           Now the case of the

petitioner is that as NBW is pending against her, she is

likely to sent to jail and therefore she preferred the

present petition with the above prayer.

      5. According to me, the above prayer of the

petitioner      cannot  be   entertained    by   this   Court,

particularly in the light of the fact that the power to grant

bail is vested with the trial court, ie., the court of Judicial

First Class Magistrate-Adoor.      Secondly, it can be seen

that the petitioner was disappeared when the original

case was posted for pronouncing judgment.            Thus, in

C.C.No.974/13, the only step towards terminating the

trial of the case is the pronouncement of the judgment,

which is left with the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-Adoor, and at that time, the petitioner

                               4
Crl.M.C.No.2485 of 2013


absconded. In such a situation, this Court will not be

justified in asking the learned Magistrate to consider the

bail application of the petitioner.     If NBW is pending

against the petitioner, it is up to the petitioner to

approach the court from where the NBW has been issued

and seek an order to cancel the same as contemplated

under section 70(2) of Cr.P.C.      Therefore, according to

me, this petition can be disposed of relegating the

petitioner to approach the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-Adoor, by filing an application to recall the

warrant.

      In the result, this M.C. is disposed of relegating the

petitioner to approach the court below with a prayer to

recall the NBW, if any pending against her and the

learned Magistrate is directed to consider the same on

merit and pass appropriate orders thereto.

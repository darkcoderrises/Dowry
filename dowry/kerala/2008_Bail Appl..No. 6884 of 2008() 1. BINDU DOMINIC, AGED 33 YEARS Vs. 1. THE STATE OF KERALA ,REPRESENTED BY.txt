       Petition for anticipatory bail.

       2. The alleged offences are under sections 420 read with

section 34 IPC. According to prosecution, petitioner who is the

1st accused was the owner of an extent of 2.17 acres of land. Out

of this, she sold 1 acre of land to a third person. Thereafter, she

sold 1.17 acres of land to her husband (A2) on 6-2-2004. She

executed a power of attorney holder in favour of her husband for

mortgaging the said property for raising a loan from the bank

for house construction. Bank advanced a loan of Rs.5 lakhs to 1st

accused on 1-10-2004, and Rs.2.5 lakhs later. The 2nd accused

was given an overdraft facility of Rs.5 lakhs on 2-3-2005. The

bank was cheated in furtherance of common intention of all the

accused including the Branch Manager.

       3. Learned counsel for                   petitioner submitted that

petitioner is absolutely innocent of the allegations made.

Petitioner was actually cheated by her own husband, against

whom she had filed a complaint under section 498A IPC. He is

absconding in that proceeding, since non-bailable warrant is

issued. What actually transpired was as follows, it is submitted:-

BA 6884/08                         -2-

Petitioner had an extent of 2.17 acres of land in her name. Out of

which, 1 acre was sold. Her husband started demanding more

dowry and she was forced to execute an assignment deed in his

favour, in respect of balance 1.17 acres of land. She executed the

document in the year 2003. The husband wanted a house to be

constructed in the property. On 10-9-2008 the husband brought

some papers for obtaining her signature when she was in the

late stage of pregnancy and stated that it was to raise a loan on

the property which was assigned to him. He colluded with the

Bank Manager and committed the offences and the Bank

Manager was suspended. But petitioner was implicated in an

offence of cheating.

       4. Petitioner was in the late stage of pregnancy at the time

of execution of power of attorney. She delivered a child on 4-10-

2004 as evidenced by Annexure-A1. Petitioner is now residing in

her parental house and though a house was constructed in 1.17

acres of land, her husband's parents are residing there. Bank

filed a complaint against 2nd accused and the proceedings are

initiated under the Securitisation Act under the Securitisation

Act against 2nd accused's property. In the above circumstances,

anticipatory bail may be granted to petitioner, it is submitted.

BA 6884/08                          -3-

        5. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that petitioner

signed power of attorney, making it appear that she had some

property in her name, which was to be mortgaged for raising

loan. She cannot exonerate from the liability, it is submitted.

However, it is conceded that it was executed on 10-9-2004.

      6. On hearing both sides, on considering the rival

contentions and the documents produced, I find that it is only fit

and proper to grant anticipatory bail to petitioner. If the relief is

refused, it is likely that petitioner will be arrested and harassed,

and she will suffer irreparable injury and loss.

      7. Hence, the following order is passed:-

      (1) Petitioner shall surrender before the Magistrate

             Court concerned within seven days from today

             and she shall be released on bail, on her

             executing a bond for Rs. 10,000/- with two

             solvent sureties each, for the like amount, to

             the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate, on

             the following conditions:-

             i)   Petitioner shall make himself available

                   for interrogation by the Investigating

                   Officer, as and when directed.

BA 6884/08                      -4-

           ii)    Petitioner shall not intimidate or

                 influence any witness or tamper with

                 evidence or commit any offence while

                 on bail.

      This petition is allowed.



                                        K.HEMA, JUDGE.

                   Crl.M.C.No.2152 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 22nd day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused No.4 in C.P.No.182 of 2011 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kattakada which is a

case instituted upon the police report [in Crime No. 632 of

2011 of Malayinkil Police Station] for the offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 323, 308 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash Annexure-A2 final report and all further

proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No. 632 of 2011 of

Malayinkil Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram District which is

now pending as C.P.No.182 of 2012 on the file of the learned

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kattakada as against

the petitioner, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation against the petitioner and other

accused is that due to the animosity of the accused towards

de facto complainant, as he interfered with a dispute between

the petitioner herein and one Unni, the accused assaulted on

the de facto complainant and A1 brandished a sword against

Crl.M.C.No. 2152 of 2013          2

the neck of the de facto complainant and had he not evaded

the same would have been fallen on his neck and thus

according to the prosecution, the accused committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 323,

308 of IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act. Now the case of

the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court between

himself and the de facto complainant           who is the second

respondent herein who sworn into Annexure-A3 affidavit and

the settlement is arrived because the petitioner and de facto

complainant are neighbours.

             3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

             4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.              Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

             5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received           from the

Crl.M.C.No. 2152 of 2013            3

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

             6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

             7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 323,

308 of IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

Crl.M.C.No. 2152 of 2013              4

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                     "57. The position that emerges from
             the above discussion can be summarised
             thus:      the power of the High Court in
             quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
             complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
             jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
             power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
             compounding the offences under S.320 of
             the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
             plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
             has to be exercised in accord with the
             guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
             secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
             abuse of the process of any Court. In what
             cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
             proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
             exercised where the offender and victim
             have settled their dispute would depend on
             the facts and circumstances of each case
             and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

             "......... But the criminal cases having
             overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
             flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes      of quashing,   particularly   the
             offences arising from commercial, financial,
             mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
             transactions or the offences arising out of
             matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
             family disputes where the wrong is basically

Crl.M.C.No. 2152 of 2013             5

             private or personal in nature and the
             parties have resolved their entire dispute.
             In this category of cases, High Court may
             quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
             because of the compromise between the
             offender and victim, the possibility of
             conviction      is remote   and   bleak  and
             continuation of criminal case would put
             accused to great oppression and prejudice
             and extreme injustice would be caused to
             him by not quashing the criminal case
             despite     full and complete settlement and
             compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

Crl.M.C.No. 2152 of 2013         6

relief as sought for.

             In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No. 632 of 2011 of

Malayinkil Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram District and all

further       proceedings  pending against  the  petitioners in

C.P.No.182 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, Kattakada.

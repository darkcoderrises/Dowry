                      B.KEMAL PASHA, J.
              ============================
                        B.A. No.55 of 2015
              =============================
             Dated this the 11th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    According to the petitioners, they are apprehending

arrest in connection with Crime No.2456 of 2014 of the

Kottarakkara Police Station, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry

and gold ornaments, after misappropriating her entire gold

ornaments and money.

     4. The learned Public Prosecutor has pointed out that

except the 1st petitioner, the other petitioners have been

removed from the array of the accused and they are not

accused in the crime. Matters being so, this bail application,

B.A. No.55 of 2015              2




as far as petitioners 2 to 5 are concerned, is not maintainable

as they need not have any apprehension of arrest at all.

      5. On hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners

and learned Public Prosecutor, and on a perusal of the

contents of the CD, I do not think that there are sufficient

materials to deny anticipatory bail to the 1st petitioner also.

Being a matrimonial offence and by considering the chance of

re-union and settlement in the matter, I am of the view that

anticipatory bail can be granted to the 1st petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed in part and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the 1st petitioner, is directed to

enlarge the 1st petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

his executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each

to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject

to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The 1st petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

B.A. No.55 of 2015               3




     11.00 a.m. on all Wednesdays and Saturdays

     commencing from 18.02.2015 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The 1st petitioner shall not tamper with

     the evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The 1st petitioner shall make himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The 1st petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

         This bail application, as far as petitioners 2 to 5 are

concerned, is dismissed as not maintainable.

                      B.A.No.5750 OF 2013
               ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 4th day of September, 2013.

                             O R D E R

     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 1260/2013 of Hill

Palace Police Station, Thripunithura, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code. He has

moved the above application seeking pre-arrest bail under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for short, 'the

Code'.

     2. The above crime was registered on a complaint given by

the wife of petitioner alleging matrimonial cruelty, ill-treatment

and harassment by him demanding dowry.              Crime registered

thereof is now pending investigation.        From the submissions

made by counsel for petitioner and also Public Prosecutor, it is

seen, in the wedlock the spouses have two children and at

present matrimonial disputes between them have given rise to

several proceedings before the Family Court.          Learned Public

Prosecutor has made available the case diary for my perusal.

After looking into the statement given by defacto complainant

B.A. No. 5750/2013                     2


which lead to registration of the crime and also other materials

collected in investigation, I find arrest and custodial interrogation

of petitioner as such may not be required for a fair investigation

of the crime.          With direction to petitioner to co-operate with

investigation, he can be granted pre-arrest bail imposing

conditions for a fair investigation of the crime.             Petition is

disposed with the following directions.

      i. Petitioner shall report before the investigating officer at

           10 a.m. on 09.09.2013.

      ii. On such appearance after his interrogation in the event of

           his arrest in the crime he shall be released on executing a

           bond for 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two

           solvent sureties for the like sum.

      iii.He shall report before the investigating officer as and when

           directed, till completion of investigation of crime.

      iv.He has to co-operate with the investigation of the crime

           and, further, not to get involved in any crime, particularly,

           in    relation  to  any    criminal   acts   against  defacto

           complainant, his wife. In the event of flouting of the

B.A. No. 5750/2013                    3


           direction as above, it is open to the investigating

           agency/defacto complainant to move the sessions judge

           for revoking the order of anticipatory bail, and, in such

           case, it is open to the sessions judge to pass appropriate

           orders thereof, without any further orders from this Court,

           but, in accordance with law.       In default of petitioner to

           appear before the investigating officer on the date and

           time fixed as above, this Order shall cease to have any

           effect and, then, it is open to the investigating officer to

           arrest petitioner, if need be, for the investigation of crime.

                  ===========================
                       Crl.M.C No.3849 of 2014
                 ============================
                Dated this the 28th day of August, 2014

                                ORDER


      Petitioner is the de facto complainant and victim in Crime No.

641/2014 of the Mueseum Police Station which was originally

registered as Crime No. 555/2014 of Petta Police Station. Her case is

that on the basis of the information furnished by her, above crime was

registered against the 3rd respondent for the offences punishable under

Sections 366, 376 and 384 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section

67B(e) of the Information Technology Act and Section 3(a) and 4 of the

Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act. Now, the case of the

petitioner is that she do not want to proceed with the above case since

she happened to give such information because of her frustration due to

the stand taken by the 3rd respondent, when she expressed her desire to

have love and company of the 3rd respondent as her future life partner.

Therefore, she preffered this petition with a prayer to quash Annexure

A1 (Crime No. 641/2014 of Mueseum Police Station).

Crl.M.C No.3849 of 2014
                                     2


      3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that

a crime was registered at the instance of the petitioner, who is a lady, and

she preffered the above complaint due to her immature approach. It is

also pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner that after

registering the above crime when the petitioner was taken to the

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, she deposed

before the said Magistrate that she do not want to proceed with the

criminal case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

parents of the petitioner came to know about the filing of the criminal

case and procedure only when the police came to their house and that the

parents also are not interested in proceeding with the criminal case

considering the future of the petitioner/victim.

      5. On the other hand, the learned Public prosecutor opposing the

petition submitted that this kind of practice should not be encouraged

since the police have already taken several steps towards the investigation

Crl.M.C No.3849 of 2014
                                     3


in the crime, which was registered at the instance of the petitioner.

According to the Public Prosecutor, if the allegation in the above crime is

correct, it is     very serious and henious one and therefore, if the 3rd

respondent is really responsible for the same, he should be punished for

the same.

      6. I am also sharing the view of the learned Public Prosecutor.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that the petitioner is only at the age

of 19 years and she is a +2 student and awaiting for further academic

career. If the criminal proceedings continue further, it will affect her

academic career as well as her personal future life. It is also relevant to

note that in the light of the above stand of the de facto complainant and if

the investigation is proceeded and even if a trial is undertaken, according

to me, in view of the changed stand of the victim there would not be any

fruitful prosecution. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

Crl.M.C No.3849 of 2014
                                                4


                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
             can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing
             a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
             inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given
             to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of
             the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
             limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
             engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
             to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power
             to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
             exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
             would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
             category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

"......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising

from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the

offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire

dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its

view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to

great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the

victim........"


              According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the changed stand

Crl.M.C No.3849 of 2014
                                      5


of the de facto complainant, who approached this Court to quash the

proceedings pending against the accused, it is only just and proper to

allow the present petition. It is also pertinent to note that since the de

facto complainant has changed her version, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer wastage of

judicial time which will amount to abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra,

this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this petition is allowed quashing Annexure A1 (Crime

No. 641/2014 of Mueseum Police Station) and all further proceedings

thereto.

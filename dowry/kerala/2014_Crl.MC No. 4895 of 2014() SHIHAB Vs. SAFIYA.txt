                 Crl.M.C.No.4895 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 27th day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.923/08

of Perumbavoor Police Station and he preferred this petition

under section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure A1 final report and all further proceedings

pending against him in L.P.No.64/13 in C.C.No.388/13 on

the file of the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-I,

Perumbavoor, since the other accused in the above crime

had faced prosecution and they are acquitted.

    2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

    3. The prosecution case is that the petitioner married

PW1, the de facto complainant, on 25.3.2007 in accordance

with the religious rites and while she was residing along

with the accused in her matrimonial house, the accused

nos.1 and 2 harassed her demanding more dowry and she

Crl.M.C.No.4895 of 2014
                                  2

was also assaulted. Thus according to the prosecution, the

accused 2 in numbers have committed the offences

punishable under section 498A r/w 34 of IPC.

      4. In the light of the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner, I have thoroughly perused

Annexure-A3 judgment. In the above judgment, particularly

in paragraph          8, the learned Magistrate, who had

undertaken the trial against the 2nd accused, has specifically

found and stated as follows :

            "The case of the prosecution is that PW1, who is the
            wife of A1, was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by
            A1 and his relatives for the purpose of meeting their
            unlawful    demand of dowry.         Prosecution has
            examined PW1 to 3. PW1 is the victim of the incident.
            PW2 and 3 are her parents. PW1 to 3 turned hostile
            to the prosecution. PW1 would say that accused have
            not harassed her for the purpose of getting more
            dowry. According to her the matter has been settled
            between the parties and she does not have any
            grievance against the accused. Moreover she filed a
            petition for compromise also. PW2 and 3 also gave
            evidence in the same line as that of PW1. Since PWs1
            to 3 turned hostile to the prosecution learned APP has
            given up the remaining formal witnesses as their
            examination will not improve the prosecution case.
            Hence evidence has been closed."

Thus, from the above extracted portion of Annexure-A3

judgment, it can be seen that the entire dispute has been

Crl.M.C.No.4895 of 2014
                              3

settled between the parties and as per the said settlement,

all the witnesses turned hostile.      When the de facto

complainant was examined, she has deposed that the

accused have not harassed her for the purpose of getting

more dowry.

      5. That being the position, even if the petitioner is

relegated to face the trial, there would not be any fruitful

turn out and the same is likely to result in wastage of

judicial time. Therefore, according to me, it is only just and

proper to allow this petition.

      In the result, this petition is allowed quashing

Annexure A1 final report and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioner in L.P.No.64/13 and in

C.C.No.388/13 on the file of the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-I, Perumbavoor.

    ==============================
                    Crl.M.C.No.946 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 11th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R


      This is an application filed by the sole accused in Crime

No.1132/12 (wrongly shown as Crime No.1132/13 in the

synopsis of the petition) of Vanchiyoor Police Station, to quash

the proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at

between the petitioner and the de facto complainant under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the

sole accused in the above crime which was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the de facto complainant who

is the third respondent herein against the petitioner alleging

offence under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code as Crime

No.1132/12 of Vanchiyoor Police Station evidenced by

Annexure 1. The matter has been now settled between the

petitioner and the de facto complainant and it was purely a

money transaction and the third respondent does not want to

proceed with the case. Since it is in the crime stage, neither

police nor the court will entertain the application for

compounding and drop further proceedings. So, the petitioner

Crl.M.C.No.946 of 2014          :  2 :

has no other remedy except to approach this court seeking

the following relief:

           "To quash the FIR in Crime No.1132/2012 of Vanchiyoor

     Police Station pending before the Honourable Additional Chief

     Judicial Magistrate Court of Thiruvananthapuram in the interest

     of equity and justice"

       3.    Third respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and the de facto

complainant does not want to proceed with the case.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court earlier filed a statement showing the

incorrect crime number which occurred on account of the

mistake committed by the petitioner in showing the crime

number in the synopsis. Later, the learned Government

Pleader filed another statement stating that except this case

there is no other case pending between the parties and it was

really a financial transaction between the parties which

resulted in filing of the complaint and that has been settled

between the parties as well. The Counsel for the petitioner

also submitted that the matter has been settled and no

purpose will be served in proceeding with the investigation.

       5.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

Crl.M.C.No.946 of 2014           :   3 :

statement given by the de facto complainant third respondent,

Annexure I First Information Report was registered as Crime

No.1132/12 of Vanchiyoor Police Station alleging offence under

Section 420 of Indian Penal Code. Even as per the allegations

in the First Information Statement that it was a money

transaction between the parties and now the matter has been

settled between the petitioner and the third respondent and

this fact was intimated to the police as well which is clear from

the statement filed by the learned Government Pleader in the

matter.

       6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:



             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
      the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.

Crl.M.C.No.946 of 2014             :  4 :

      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
      for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
      the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions
      or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc;
      or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
      dispute.   In this category of case, High Court may quash
      criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
      remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
      accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
      case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
      the victim.    In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
      to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
      criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the victim
      and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
      well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




       7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a matter of

pure civil dispute between the parties which resulted in the

registration of crime and that has been settled between the

parties and no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

investigation itself as the complainant is not going to co-

operate with the investigation and even if final report is filed

that is not going to end in conviction in view of the settlement

Crl.M.C.No.946 of 2014      :   5 :

arrived at between the parties, this court feels that it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

       So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.1132/12 of Vanchiyoor Police Station against the

petitioner is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this

order to the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Thiruvananthapuram, to communicate this order to the

concerned police station for necessary further action in this

regard.

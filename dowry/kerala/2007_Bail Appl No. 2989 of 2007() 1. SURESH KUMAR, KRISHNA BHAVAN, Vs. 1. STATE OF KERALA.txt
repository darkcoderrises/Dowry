        The petitioners who are the husband, father-in-law and mother-


in-law   of   the   de   facto   complainant,   namely,   Bincy   Mol   seek


aniticipatory   bail.   The   petitioners   are   accused   Nos.   1   to   3   in   Crime


No.508/2006   of   Mavelikkara   Police   Station   for     offences   punishable


under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.


        2.   The   learned   Public   Prosecutor   submitted   that   the   case   is


already resulted in the filing of the charge sheet after the investigation


and   the   request   for   anticipatory   bail   is   virtually   misconceived.   The


petitioners   may   therefore   surrender   before   the   Magistrate   concerned


and   file   an  application   for   regular   bail  within  two   weeks   from   today,


the same shall be considered and disposed of preferably on the same


date on which it is filed.


        This application is disposed of as above.





                                                   V.RAMKUMAR,JUDGE

    ==============================
                Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 27th day of May, 2014.




                          O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the

sole accused in C.C.No.1090/2013 pending before Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery to quash the proceedings

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   Originally this petition was filed to quash the

proceedings alleging that no ingredients were mentioned in the

complaint so as to attract the offence under 498A of Indian

Penal Code.     It is mentioned in the petition that first

respondent who is the complainant in the case is the wife of

the petitioner   and their    marriage   was solemnized     on

07.09.2008 at St.Mary's Church, Kandanad and a female child

was born to them in their wedlock.     Thereafter, there were

some differences of opinion arose between them and first

respondent filed M.C.No.162/2013 before the Family Court,

Ernakulam seeking maintenance for herself and the minor child

and also filed O.P.No.991/2013 seeking a decree for divorce

and O.P.No.958/2013 before the same court against the

Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013     :  2 :

petitioner and his parents for recovery of money and gold

ornaments or its value. Besides those litigations, she filed a

private complaint before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Kolenchery against the petitioner alleging offences

under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code and after enquiry,

the learned magistrate has taken cognizance of the case as

C.C.No.1090/2013 under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code

and issued summons to the petitioner, that was originally

challenged by the petitioner seeking the following relief:

            "To quash all proceedings in CC No.1090/2013

      on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class

      Magistrate, Kolenchery in the interest of justice."



      3.     First respondent appeared before this court through

Counsel and on the basis of the submissions made by both the

Counsels and also considering the fact that it is a matrimonial

dispute and several litigations are pending between he parties

before the Family Court and the Criminal Court, this court felt

that this can be sent for mediation and accordingly, both

parties were directed to appear before this court. Pursuant to

the same, they appeared and the matter was referred for

mediation and in mediation, the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013      : 3 :

amicably and parties have decided to withdraw all the

litigations pending before the courts including this criminal

prosecution. Accordingly, the first respondent filed an affidavit

before this court stating these facts expressing her willingness

to quash the proceedings in view of the settlement arrived at

in the mediation.

      4.     Heard both sides.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and the

first respondent are husband and wife and due to difference of

opinion between them, several litigations have been initiated

at the instance of the first respondent before the Family Court

and also a private complaint before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate     Court,  Kolenchery   which   resulted  in  taking

cognizance by the magistrate as C.C.No.1090/2013 against the

petitioner under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code. In the

mediation, the matter has been settled and parties have

decided to separate by filing a joint petition for divorce and

also decided to settle all the claims pending before the Family

Court and also to withdraw this case.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab 2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), it is held as

Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013        :  4 :

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013         :  5 :

      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


      7.     Since it is a family dispute and all the issues in

respect of the matrimonial conflict between the petitioner and

respondent have been settled in the mediation conducted in

Ernakulam Mediation Centre and they have arrived at an

agreement to settle all the issues and withdraw all the cases

including the criminal case on certain terms and the settlement

will promote harmony, happiness and peace in their future life,

this court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings so as to promote the settlement arrived

at between the parties in the mediation and to secure a safety

and happy life in their future.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.1090/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolenchery as against the petitioner is

Crl.M.C.No.5579 of 2013    : 6 :

quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

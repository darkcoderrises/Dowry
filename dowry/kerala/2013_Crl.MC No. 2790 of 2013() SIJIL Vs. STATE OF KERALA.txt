                       Crl.M.C.No. 2790 of 2013
                    ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 9th day of July, 2013

                                 O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused in Crime No. 754 of 2012 of Mala

Police   Station   for    the   offences      punishable    under Sections

323,341,324,325,308 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings in S.C.No.688 of 2012 pending on the

file of the Assistant Sessions Court, Irinjalakuda as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.    The prosecution allegation in the above case is that on

7.7.2012 at about 9 p.m. the petitioners had assaulted the second and

third respondents and in the incident, the third respondent sustained

injury to his nasal bone and the accused beat the de facto complainant

with a wooden stick and thereby committed the offences punishable

Crl.M.C.No.2790 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

under Sections 323,341,324,325,308 read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of

court between the petitioners and the de facto complainant since the

incident had occurred due to mis-understanding and now, due to the

intervention of the senior citizens of the locality as well as the

interference of the senior members of the families of both the parties,

the entire disputes are settled amicably.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second and third respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2790 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

         5. The learned counsel for the second and third respondents,

who on the basis of specific instruction received             from the

respondents, submitted that the above respondents, who are the de

facto complainant and the injured do not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. Annexures II and III are the affidavits sworn to by

the de facto complainant and the injured, who are respondents 2 and 3.

I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only    Sections 323,341,324,325,308 read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

Crl.M.C.No.2790 of 2013

                                       :-4-:

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second and third respondents, it appears to me that the

the de facto complainant and the injured have no further grievance

against the petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.    In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

Crl.M.C.No.2790 of 2013

                                             :-5-:

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and compromise with the

Crl.M.C.No.2790 of 2013

                                   :-6-:

         victim........"


         8.      According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of

this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

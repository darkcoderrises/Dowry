                Dated this the 8th day of July, 2013

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner       is   the     second       accused        in Crime

No.269/2012 of Mannar Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) and 498A

read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the de facto

complainant and treated her with cruelty, by demanding an

amount of Rs.1,00,000/- more as dowry. It is alleged that, on

19.04.2012, during night, she was severely beaten by the first

accused, who is her husband. During midnight also, again she

was beaten. When she cried aloud, the petitioner, who is the

younger brother of the first accused, and their father came over

there and they also abused and tortured the de facto

complainant. It is specifically alleged that they wanted to send

BA.No.3388/2013
                                    : 2 :



her out of the matrimonial home, for which they called the father

of the de facto complainant and her brothers to the house.

When they reached there, the petitioner beat on the head of the

de facto complainant with a torch, thereby causing a serious

injury.

      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The contents of

the CD, prima facie, reveal the complicity of the petitioner. It

seems that the de facto complainant was hospitalised and was

undergoing treatment as inpatient. The allegations against the

petitioner are very grave and serious. The investigation of this

case is not over. Considering the seriousness of the allegations

against the petitioner and the present stage of the investigation, I

am satisfied that he is not entitled to get the discretionary relief

of anticipatory bail.

      In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

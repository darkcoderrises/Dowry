                  Crl.M.C. NO. 2572 of 2014
            ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                              ORDER



      Petitioners are accused in C.C. No.1065/2009 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram, arising out

of Crime No. 217/2009 of Kondotty Police Station, registered

alleging offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 326,

323, 324, 506 (i) read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

The prosecution allegation is that on 24.04.2009, at or about

24.00 hours, the accused carrying weapon like stick, reaper,

cycle chain etc., attacked the injured in connection with a football

tournament. A counter case was also registered against the

injured, who are arrayed as respondents 2 to 7 in this Crl.M.C., at

the instance of the petitioners and the same stands quashed by

this  Court    by    judgment   dated    04.12.2013   in   Crl.M.C.

No.5837/2013.       Now, the petitioners submit that the entire

dispute between the parties have been settled and in order to

substantiate the same Annexure C to E affidavit sworn by the

injured have been produced along with Crl.M.C., as per which the

Crl.M.C. NO. 2572 of 2014         2


dispute between the parties have already been settled amicably

and they have no intention to proceed against the petitioners.

Therefore, the prayer sought in this Crl.M.C. is to quash the

proceedings in C.C. No.1065/2009 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram.

      2. Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public

Prosecutor for the first respondent and the learned counsel

appearing for respondents 2 to 7.

      3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108, the

Apex Court held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the

purpose      of   quashing, particularly offences    arising  from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating to

dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

entire dispute. In these category of cases, High Court may quash

criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise

between the offender and the victim, the possibility of a

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

Crl.M.C. NO. 2572 of 2014           3


extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

criminal case despite full and complete settlement and

compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court may

consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process

of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

to the above question is in affirmative the High Court shall be

well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.

      4. The allegation against the petitioners is for commission

of offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 326, 323,

324, 506 (i) read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. Now,

as evident from Annexure C to E affidavits sworn by respondents

2 to 7, who are the injured persons, the matter has been

amicably settled between the parties and the said injured persons

have no intention to proceed against the petitioners. The counter

case initiated at the instance of the petitioners against the said

respondents has also stands quashed by the judgment of this

Court in Crl.M.C. No.5837/2013.

Crl.M.C. NO. 2572 of 2014       4


      5. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

power of this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings in C.C.

No.1065/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Malappuram, in view of the judgment of the Apex Court in

Gian Singh's case supra.

      6.     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the

proceedings in C.C. No. 1065/2009 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram is quashed.

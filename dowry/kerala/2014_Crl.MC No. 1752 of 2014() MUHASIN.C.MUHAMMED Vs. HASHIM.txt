          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 25th day of March, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is field by

accused    Nos.       1      to      3      in      Crime          No.267/2014        of

Moovattupuzha Police Station, to quash the proceedings on

the basis of the settlement, invoking the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

called the 'Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that the

petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No.267/2014 of

Moovattupuzha Police Station.                      It was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the first respondent as

defacto-complainant,            against          the       petitioners,         alleging

offences under Section 143, 147, 341, 323, 324, 294(b) read

with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. Now the matter

has been settled between the parties. There was a counter

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                   2

case as Crime No.266/2014 of the same Police Station,

which was registered on the basis of the statement given by

the second petitioner herein and that was also now settled.

Now both the cases have been settled between the parties,

due to the intervention of neighbours, mediators and well-

wishers and some solution has been arrived at in respect of

taking the vehicles from the crusher unit belonging to the

first respondent.       They do not want to proceed with the

prosecution. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the investigation.             Since, the

case is in the crime stage, neither the court below nor the

police will drop the proceedings. So they have no other

option except to approach this court, seeking the following

relief:

             "In the above said circumstance it is most humbly
      prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash
      Annexure-1 FIR and all further proceedings in Crime
      No.267 of 2014 of the Moovattupuzha Police Station by
      allowing this Criminal Miscellaneous Case."



            3.    Respondents 1 to 3 appeared through

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                              3

counsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled and

some solution has been arrived at in the mediation held at

the intervention of respectful personalities in the locality,

regarding the transport of metals from the crusher unit run

by the first respondent herein.      They do not want to

prosecute the case. They have also filed affidavits in support

of their submissions made. The counsel for the petitioners

also submitted that in view of the settlement, no purpose

will be served, in proceeding with the case.

            4.    On the other hand, the learned Public

Prosecutor, on instructions, as directed by this court,

submitted that the first petitioner herein in the police

constable and in respect of this incident, a disciplinary

action has been initiated by the department and opposed

the application, on the ground that the investigation is in

the primitive stage.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, the first

respondent is conducting a crusher unit and there was some

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                 4

dispute regarding the transport of metals from the crusher

unit using heavy vehicles through the road and the public

had objected the same and on account of that, some

incident happened and the first and the 2nd respondent

sustained some injuries.       On the basis of the statement

given by the first respondent Annexure-A1 first information

report     was      registered  as   crime   No.267/2014    of

Moovattupuzha Police Station and the investigation is in

progress. In respect of the same incident, on the basis of

the statement given by the 2nd petitioner herein, another

case was registered as Crime No.266/2014 of the same

police station, in respect of the same incident. Both these

cases were now settled between the parties, due to the

intervention of mediators, well-wishers and the local people

and some solution has been arrived at in respect of

transport of metals from the crusher unit conducted by the

first respondent herein.

            6.    It is true that, there were some allegations

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                5

against the first petitioner, who is working in the police

department and the learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that, in respect of the incident, disciplinary proceedings

have been recommended and that is pending. I am not at

this stage going to the question, as to whether the

department is entitled to proceed against the first petitioner

etc., in this proceeding. Considering the fact that, entire

dispute in the locality has been settled and the people are

very much affected by running of crusher units in the

residential areas and that has caused some problem, which

appears to be the root cause for the incident and that has

been resolved between the parties, no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case, as neither the defacto-

complainant nor his witnesses are likely to support the case

and even if the final report is filed, that will not end in

conviction of the accused persons as well.

            7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                       6

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                      7

      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the matter has

been settled between the parties and the entire incidents

happened on account of running of a crusher unit in that

area and transport of metal from the crusher unit during

night time and it has become a social problem in the locality

and that has been now settled and harmony has been

brought in the locality and no purpose will be served by

proceeding       with     the case,       as   neither    the defacto-

complainant, injured nor the witnesses are going to support

the investigation or even if final report is filed, support the

prosecution and proceeding with case will only a wastage of

judicial time, this court feels that, it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the 'Code' can be invoked to

quash the proceedings.             So, the petition is allowed and

further       proceedings         in     Crime       No.267/2014     of

Crl. M.C. No.1752 of 2014
                                  8

Moovattupuzha Police Station, as against the petitioners is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Moovattupuzha,

so as to inform the concerned Police Station for necessary

further action in this regard.

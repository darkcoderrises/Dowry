                        ------------------------------------
                        Crl.M.C. No. 4041 of 2012
                        ------------------------------------
           DATED THIS THE 2nd DAY OF JANUARY, 2013

                                   O R D E R


      The prayer is to quash Annexure I F.I.R. in Crime No.223/2012 of

Kozhikode Town Police Station. This is a case where the offences alleged

are under Sections 457, 461 and 381 I.P.C.

      2. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

complainant as well as the petitioner are from the State of Rajasthan. The

petitioner, it appears, was a salesman under the second respondent. It is

also stated that they are close relatives. It is further submitted that the

disputes between the parties have been amicably settled. Learned counsel

for the petitioner submits that only because of certain disputes between the

parties, the complaint happened to be raised in the matter. Even though the

petitioner was granted bail, he could not execute the bond for want of

sufficient funds. He is not having any other relatives in the State of Kerala

and he is still remaining in the Sub Jail, Kozhikode.

      3. Heard learned counsel for the second respondent. It is submitted

that the matter was settled between the parties. An affidavit has also been

filed by the second respondent, a copy of which is produced as Annexure II.

Crl.M.C.No.4041/2012
                                      -2-


      4. Learned Public Prosecutor also, after getting oral instructions,

submitted that the parties have settled their disputes.

      5. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon a decision of the

Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 - SC), to

contend that in a matter lime this, this Court can exercise the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      6. The question is whether the offence herein will be one coming

within the purview of the principles stated by the Apex Court in the above

decision.     It was held therein that           the criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

footing for the purposes of quashing, viz. offences arising from commercial,

financial, mercantile, civil, partnership, or such like transactions or the

offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family

disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute.

      7. Herein, the parties are close relatives and there was master and

servant relationship also between the parties.      In  the   light  of   the

peculiar nature of the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of

the settlement between the parties,       there will not be any purpose in

Crl.M.C.No.4041/2012
                                     -3-


proceeding with the case.. Therefore, I am satisfied that this Court can

consider the plea raised by the parties, in exercise of the jurisdiction under

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

      Therefore, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The First Information Report in

Crime No.223/2012 of Kozhikode Town Police Station and all further

proceedings including final report in the case are quashed. The petitioner

will be released from custody. No costs.



                                T.R.RAMACHANDRAN NAIR, JUDGE

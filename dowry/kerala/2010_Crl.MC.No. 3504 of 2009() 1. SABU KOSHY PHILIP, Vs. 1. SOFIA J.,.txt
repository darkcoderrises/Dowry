                  Cr. MC No.3504 of 2009-C
                 -------------------------------------
                   Dated 2nd February 2010

                               Order

           This is a petition filed under S.482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure, seeking to have Annexures A1 and

A2 pending before the JFCM Court, Mavelikkara, quashed.

           2. The petitioner is the second accused in CC

No.701/08 on the file of the JFCM Court, Mavelikkara for

having committed the offences punishable under Ss.498A

and 323 r/w S.34 IPC. The first accused is the younger

brother of the petitioner and the third accused is his

mother. The proceedings originated on private complaint,

which was referred for investigation under S.156(3) Cr.P.C.

The Police, after investigation, filed final report, the

cognizance of which was taken by the JFCM Court,

Mavelikkara.

           3. The marriage between the first respondent

and the first accused was solemnized on 21.10.2002. The

allegation against the accused is that subsequent to the

CRMC 3504/09                         2

marriage, there was persistent demand for dowry of Rs.2 lakhs

more, which could not be met by the parents of the first

respondent.     There was physical harassment also.            The

petitioner submits that the first respondent/complainant had

earlier filed an application under S.12 of the Protection of

Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 before the JFCM

Court-III, Mavelikkara. But that application was dismissed by

the said Court, it is submitted. That by itself cannot be a ground

to interfere with the present proceedings. From the records, it is

felt that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner

herein. Whether the Prosecution will be able to succeed in the

case against the accused, is a different matter. But, on the

allegations, it could not be said that no offence is made out

against the petitioner. In the facts and circumstances of the

case, there is no justification in interfering with the proceedings

now. This petition is devoid of any merit and it is accordingly

dismissed.

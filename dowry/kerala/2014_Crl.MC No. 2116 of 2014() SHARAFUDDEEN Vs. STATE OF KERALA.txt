                  Crl.M.C. No. 2116 of 2014-B
               ---------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 9th             April, 2014

                            O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C. 724/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Mavelikkara on

the basis of the settlement under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C. 724/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Mavelikkara.

The case was registered             as Crime No. 331/2012 of

Nooranad Police Station on the basis of the statement given

by the 2nd respondent as defacto complainant against the

petitioners alleging the offence under Section 324 read

with Section      34 of the         Indian Penal Code.             After

investigation, final report         was filed and the case was

taken on file as C.C. 724/2013           and it is pending before

Crl.M.C. No. 2116 of 2014-B
                                     2

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Mavelikkara.

     3. The incident occurred in a fish market due to some

misunderstanding happened between                  the petitioners and

the 2nd respondent, both were fish                 merchants in the

market. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties due to intervention of mediators. No purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case in view of the

settlement. Since it is a non-compoundable offence they

could not approach the court below for filing an application

for compounding. So they have no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following reliefs"

                "For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of

                hearing it is humbly prayed that this Honourable court may

                be   pleased to quash Annexure A charge sheet and all

                further proceedings in C.C.       724/2013 on the file of

                Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -II, Mavelikkara".


     4. The 2nd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter           has been settled between the

parties     and the incident occurred                   due to        some

 Crl.M.C. No. 2116 of 2014-B
                                3

misunderstanding regarding         fish vending in the market

and due to intervention of well-wishers of both parties, the

matter has been settled and their original relationship has

been restored and he filed Annexure B affidavit stating

these facts and he does not want to proceed with the

prosecution against th petitioners. The counsel for the

petitioners submitted that     in view of the settlement there

is no possibility       of any conviction and he prayed for

allowing the application.

      5. The learned Public Prosecutor,       on instructions,

as directed by this Court, submitted that except this case

there is no other case against the petitioners and they have

no criminal background as well but opposed the application.

      6.   It is an admitted     fact  that on the basis    of

statement given by the       2nd respondent,    a   case  was

registered as Crime No. 331/2012 of          Nooranad police

station against the petitioners alleging the offence under

Section 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

 Crl.M.C. No. 2116 of 2014-B
                                  4

It is also an admitted fact          that after investigation,

Annexure A final report was filed and the case was taken

on file as C.C. 724/2013 and pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court - II, Mavelikkara. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties as evident from

Annexure B affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent. It is seen

from the allegations in the final report and also in the

affidavit that the        incident occurred in a fish market

between two fish vendors          in respect of some dispute

regarding fish vending in the fish market. Now due to the

intervention of well-wishers and friends of both parties,

the matter has been settled between the parties and the

original relationship between      them has been restored. In

view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well as neither the defacto

complainant nor his witnesses will support the prosecution

case and conviction in such case is remote.

                               5

     7.   Further it cannot be said to be an incident of

public interest and it was a dispute between two individual

happened in respect of some dispute regarding the fish

vending to be done in a fish market and it has been settled

as well.

     8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

           "The position that emerges from the above
    discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
    High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
    or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
    distinct and different from the power given to a
    criminal court for compounding the offences under
    S.320 of the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
    plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
    exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
    such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
    to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
    cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
    complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
    offender and victim have settled their dispute would
    depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
    and no category can be prescribed. However, before
    exercise of such power, the High Court must have due
    regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
    Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
    offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be
    fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's
    family and the offender have settled the dispute.
    Such offences are not private in nature and have

Crl.M.C. No. 2116 of 2014-B
                                 6

    serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
    between the victim and offender in relation to the
    offences under special statutes like Prevention of
    Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
    servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
    provide    for    any  basis    for   quashing    criminal
    proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
    cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
    civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
    of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
    commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
    such like transactions or the offences arising out of
    matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
    disputes where the wrong is basically private or
    personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
    entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court
    may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
    of the compromise between the offender and victim,
    the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
    continuation of criminal case would put accused to
    great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
    would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
    case despite full and complete settlement and
    compromise with the victim. In other words, the High
    Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
    contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal
    proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
    law despite settlement and compromise between the
    victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
    of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
    end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
    affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
    jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

                                7




      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case and conviction will be

remote in such cases on account of the settlement, this

Court feels that it is a matter where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote settlement

which resulted in the harmony of business community of

petitioners and the 2nd respondent.

      11.    Hence     the application is allowed and further

proceedings      in C.C. 724/2013 (Crime No. 331/ 2012 of

Nooranadu       Police Station) pending before the   Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court No.II, Mavelikkara    as against

the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Mavelikkara so

as to inform the concerned police station for necessary

further action in this regard.

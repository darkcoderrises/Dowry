                Dated this the 7th day of April, 2015

                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

            This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime

No.619/2011 of Thamarassery Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 323, 406, 420 and

498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A1 final report in Crime No.619/2011 of

Thamarassery Police Station as against the petitioners and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.29/2012 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,

Thamarassery, quashed.

      4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

Crl.M.C.2074/2015
                              : 2 :



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more     dowry,   after  misappropriating   her   entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the de facto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute    between    the  petitioners  and    the   de  facto

complainant have been amicably settled and presently, the

de facto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners and, therefore, the proceedings against the

petitioners may be quashed.

      7.     The de facto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners and,    therefore,   all   further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

Crl.M.C.2074/2015
                                : 3 :



quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

counsel. The learned counsel for the de facto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the de facto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the de facto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

final report in Crime No.619/2011 of Thamarassery Police

Station as against the petitioners and all further proceedings

based on it in C.C.29/2012 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery are hereby

quashed.

               Crl.M.C. NO. 3294 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 17th day of December, 2012

                             ORDER


           Petitioners are the accused in a crime registered at

Ernakulam Town North Police Station, which is pending

investigation. Annexure-I is the F.I.R. registered in the crime

for the offence punishable under Section 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The crime was registered

on a complaint given by the second respondent, who is the

wife of the first petitioner. Matrimonial disputes between the

spouses have given rise to the complaint alleging cruelty and

harassment by the husband and his close relatives, demanding

dowry. After registration of the crime spouses have settled

their disputes and they have decided to separate, is the

submission of learned counsel for petitioners stating that

already a petition has been filed before the competent Family

Court for dissolution of their marriage.    Second respondent

represented by a counsel also endorses the submissions made

Crl.M.C. NO. 3294 of 2012          2


as above. Learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions

from the Investigating Officer reports that the parties have

settled the matter. In such circumstances where the crime has

been registered on account of matrimonial disputes between

the first petitioner and second respondent, the spouses,

settlement effected by them has necessarily to be taken due

note of to decide whether continuation of the proceedings is

essential to advance the ends of justice. In Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] the apex court has held that

in crimes registered over offences arising from matrimonial

disputes or from disputes of civil flavour settlement effected by

the parties can be recognized to exercise the inherent powers

of this court to terminate the proceedings. Further more, even

if any indictment is laid after completion of investigation and

trial ensues, in view of the settlement effected by the parties

chances of such trial ending in the conviction of any of the

person proceeded against is remote. At best it may result only

in wastage of precious time of the court. Taking into account

those aspects as well, crime registered under Annexure-I F.I.R.

Crl.M.C. NO. 3294 of 2012          3


at Ernakulam Town North Police Station, and all further

proceedings     against    petitioners/accused  are    quashed

exercising the inherent powers of this court, under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

                Crl.M.C.No.3653 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013.


                         O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is 3rd accused in Crime No.

243/2006 of Pattambi Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 308 r/w 34 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the entire proceedings in

L.P.No.8/2012 of Assistant Sessions Court, Ottapalam, as

the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

12.5.2006, at or about 5.00 p.m., due to political animosity,

the accused attacked respondent nos.2 and 3, while they

were coming in a motor car. It is alleged that the first

accused stabbed respondent no.2 and caused injury. The

other accused assaulted the 3rd respondent and caused

Crl.M.C.No.3653 of 2013
                              2

injuries. The prosecution asserts that unless the de facto

complainant moved away, the accused would have caused

his death. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter

is settled out of court with the 2nd respondent/de facto

complainant and the 3rd respondent/injured, who had sworn

into Annexures B and C affidavits.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.         Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5.      The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the

Crl.M.C.No.3653 of 2013
                                3

injured do not intends to proceed any further against the

petitioner and they have no grievance against him.

         6.        I  have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341,

323, 324, 308 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it

Crl.M.C.No.3653 of 2013
                                    4

appears to me that the de facto complainant and the

injured have no further grievance against the petitioner/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In

this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,

Crl.M.C.No.3653 of 2013
                                   5

         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

                                6

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioner in

L.P.No.8/2012 of Assistant Sessions Court, Ottapalam, in

Crime No.243/2006 of Pattambi Police Station.

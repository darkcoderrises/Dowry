              Dated this the 26th May, 2009

                           O R D E R

     This is an application for anticipatory bail under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioners are the

accused in Crime No.191/2009 of Vattapara Police Station,

which was originally registered as Crime No.213 of 2009 of

Mangalapuram Police Station.

     2. The offence alleged against the petitioners is under

Section 498A read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3. The prosecution case is that the petitioners demanded

dowry of Rs.1 Crore. The first petitioner is the husband of the

de facto complainant, while the second petitioner is the

mother of the first petitioner. Learned counsel for petitioners

pointed out that the first petitioner filed O.P.No.533/2009 on

11.5.2009 before the Family Court, Nedumangad against the

de facto complainant for restitution of conjugal rights and that

the complaint was filed only thereafter.

      4. Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the

case, the nature of the offence and other circumstances, I am

of the view that anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioners. There will be a direction that in the event of the

arrest of the petitioners, the officer in charge of the police

station shall release them on bail for a period of one month on

their executing bond for Rs.25,000/- each with two solvent

sureties for the like amount to the satisfaction of the officer

concerned, subject to the following conditions:

      A)        The first petitioner shall report before the

                 investigating officer between 9 AM and 11

                 AM on all Mondays, till the final report is

                 filed or until further orders;

      B)         The petitioners shall appear before the

                 investigating officer for interrogation as

                 and when required;

      C)        The petitioners shall not try to influence the

                 prosecution witnesses or tamper with the

                 evidence;

      D)       The petitioners shall not commit any offence

                 or indulge in any prejudicial activity while

                 on bail.

 BA.2741/09                     3

     E)       On the    expiry of the period mentioned

              above, the petitioners shall surrender

              before the Magistrate concerned and seek

              regular bail.

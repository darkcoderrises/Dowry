                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
          Dated this the 15th day of November, 2013.

                                  ORDER


          Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No. 730 of

2013 of Malayinkeezhu Police Station, who is alleged to have

committed offences punishable under Section 306 of Indian

Penal Code.

          2. The allegation against the petitioner appears to

be that he was in deep love with the victim for several years

while teaching in a parallel college. Later on, the petitioner

secured a Government job.                   The allegation is that the

petitioner sought for dowry so as to marry her. The victim

was unable to put up with the said conduct of the petitioner,

which drove her to commit suicide.

          3. The petitioner would say that he is innocent and

he has been falsely implicated.             According to him, he got the

Government job long ago and he has not committed any act as

B.A.7603/2013.                  2

alleged. According to the petitioner, even assuming that the

allegations are true, offence under Section 306 of I.P.C. cannot

be attracted.

            4. Learned Public Prosecutor only pointed out that

the suicide notes obtained clearly show the involvement of the

petitioner and he was responsible for the mishap. It is also

pointed out that investigation is at an infant stage.

            5.  After having heard learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor and having

perused the records,     though it could not be said that the

petitioner is totally innocent,     there seems to be some

substance in the contention of the petitioner that         even

assuming all what the prosecution says is true, offence under

Section 306 of I.P.C. cannot be attracted. The suicide notes

are all undated. True, they were addressed to the petitioner.

It shows her hate for the petitioner due to his conduct.

Initially crime was registered for unnatural death. It was on

discovery of the suicidal notes that the petitioner has been

B.A.7603/2013.                   3

implicated. A probe into the veracity of the allegations is not

warranted at this point of time, nor is it proper to scrutinize

whether the allegations if taken in toto can attract Section 306

of I.P.C. Considering the nature of the materials against the

petitioner and also such other facts, it is felt that this is a fit

case where       the extraordinary jurisdiction needs to be

exercised in favour of the petitioner.

            Therefore, this application is allowed        on the

following conditions:

      i) Petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating
      Officer on or before 22.11.2013, who, after
      interrogation, shall produce him before the court
      concerned, which court, on application for bail
      being moved by the petitioner, shall release him on
      bail on his executing a bond for a sum of
      Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only)
      with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to
      the satisfaction of the said court.

B.A.7603/2013.                   4

      ii) The court concerned may ensure the identity of
      the sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts
      produced by the sureties for the purpose of
      executing the bond.



      iii) Petitioner shall report before the Investigating
      Officer on every Tuesday between 9 a.m. and 11
      a.m. until further orders.



      iv) Petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper
      with the evidence or influence or try to influence the
      witnesses.



      v) If any of the conditions is violated, bail granted
      to the petitioner shall stand cancelled, and the court
      concerned may take such steps as are available in
      law.

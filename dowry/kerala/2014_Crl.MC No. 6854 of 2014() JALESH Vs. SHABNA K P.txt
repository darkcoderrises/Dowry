           ...............................................................
           Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A4 in Crime No.902/2013 of the

Valapattanam Police Station, Kannur registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I charge sheet and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.1650/2013

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Kannur, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

CRL.M.C.No.6854 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.6854 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I

charge sheet and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.1650/2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Kannur, are hereby quashed.

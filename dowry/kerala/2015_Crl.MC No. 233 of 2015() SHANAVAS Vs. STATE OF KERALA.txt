                    CRL. M.C. No.233 of 2015
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 19th day of January, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A4 in Crime No.89/2011 of the

Kilikolloor Police Station, Kollam registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 323 and 498A read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.     Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I F.I.R. in Crime

No.89/2011 of the Kilikolloor Police Station, Kollam and all

further proceedings based on it, quashed.

     3.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.No.233 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaint against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,  who     is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaint

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.No.233 of 2015
                              -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I

F.I.R. in Crime No.89/2011 of Kilikolloor Police Station,

Kollam and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.614/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Kollam, are hereby quashed.

                  Crl.M.C.No.1496 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 5th day of June, 2013

                         ORDER


     The petitioners are accused in C.C.No.467/2012

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kollam and they preferred this petition under Section 482

of the Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 charge

sheet and all further proceedings in C.C.No.467/2012, as

the matter has been settled out of Court.

     2. C.C.No.467/2012 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam is instituted upon the

report filed by the police in Crime No.186/2012 of

Eravipuram Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 120(B), 420 and 506(ii) r/w 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.      Going by the materials produced

along with the above petition, it can be seen that the

criminal case is connected with a civil transaction between

the petitioners and the de-facto complainant.       Now the

Crl.M.C.No.1496/2013        : 2 :




case of the petitioner is that as the matter is settled out of

court,     the proceedings pending before the Court below is

abuse of process of the Court.

      3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners and the respondents and also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

      4.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the subject matter

of the dispute is connected with the property transaction. If

that be so and particularly when the dispute has been

settled between the contesting parties, especially in view of

the decision in Gian Singh v. State of Kerala[2012(4) KLT

108(SC)], according to me, this Crl.M.C. can be disposed

of, even though non-compoundable offences are involved.

In the said decision, the Apex Court has held that "but the

criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of

quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

Crl.M.C.No.1496/2013          : 3 :




financial,    mercantile,  civil,  partnership or   such   like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

relating to dowry".     Therefore, the petitioners are entitled

to the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of, quashing

Annexure-A1 charge sheet and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.467/2012 before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam.

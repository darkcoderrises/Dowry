                   Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2014
           -------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 28th day of May, 2014

                               ORDER

      This is an application filed by accused numbers 1 to 4 in C.C

No.846/2011 pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Adoor to quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement u/s 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are arrayed as

accused numbers 1 to 4 in C.C No.846/2011 on the file of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Adoor. Crime was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the de facto complainant, second

respondent herein, as Crime No.160/2011 of Enathu Police Station

of Pathanamthitta district alleging commission of offences u/s 341,

323, 427 and 294(b) r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, final report was filed and the case was taken on file

as C.C No.846/2011 and is pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Adoor.        Now, the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C No.2528/2014               2



between the parties. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case.      Further, no possibility of

conviction also in such cases. Some of the offences alleged are

non-compoundable in nature and they could not file an application

before the court below. So they have no other remedy except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

             i)   Quash Annexure 1 charge and all further
                  proceedings there from in the light of
                  Annexure 2 affidavit sworn by the 2nd
                  respondent / injured.

      3.    Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties due

to intervention of mediators and on account of the settlement,

petitioner does not want to prosecute the respondent and he had

filed Annexure A2 affidavit stating these facts.

      4. Counsel for petitioner also submitted that in view of the

settlement, no purpose will be served by keeping the case on file

and no conviction will be possible as well.

Crl.M.C No.2528/2014             3



      5. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions as directed by

this court submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioners but opposed the application.

      6. Heard both sides.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent Crime No.160/2011 of Enathu

Police Station was registered against the petitioners alleging

offences u/s 341, 323, 427 and 294(b) r/w Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code and after investigation final report was filed and it was

taken on file as C.C No.846/2011 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Adoor and it is pending before that court. In the mean

time the matter has been settled between the parties and the second

respondent, de facto complainant, has filed Annexure A2 affidavit

stating that he had given the names of petitioners under some

misconception and he has no grievance against the petitioners and

the matter has been settled between the parties due to the

Crl.M.C No.2528/2014                 4



intervention of mediators as well. Considering the fact that the

matter has been now settled, there is no possibility of any

conviction being entered in such cases. It will be only a futile

attempt to keep the case on file and allow the case for a regular

disposal and it will amount to wastage of judicial time.

      8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:

                        "The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the power
           of the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding
           or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
           given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is
           of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
           justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
           where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
           of each case and no category can be prescribed.
           However, before exercise of such power, the High
           Court must have due regard to the nature and
           gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
           mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
           though the victim or victim's family and the offender
           have settled the dispute.      Such offences are not

Crl.M.C No.2528/2014                 5


           private in nature and have serious impact on society.
           Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
           offender in relation to the offences under special
           statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
           offences committed by public servants while working
           in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
           quashing     criminal   proceedings     involving  such
           offences.       But    the   criminal    cases   having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership
           or such like transactions or the offences arising out
           of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
           words, the High Court must consider whether it
           would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
           to    continue  with   the   criminal    proceeding  or
           continuation    of  the   criminal  proceeding    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
           settlement and compromise between the victim and
           wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
           it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if
           the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
           the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
           quash the criminal proceeding."


      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled between

Crl.M.C No.2528/2014               6



the parties and on account of the settlement conviction in such

cases is remote and allowing the case to continue will only amount

to wastage of judicial time, this court feels that it is a fit case where

the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings.

            So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C No.846/2011(Crime No.160/2011 of Enathu Police Station) on

the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate, Adoor as against the

petitioners is quashed.

       Office is directed to communicate this order to the court

concerned immediately for necessary further action in the matter.

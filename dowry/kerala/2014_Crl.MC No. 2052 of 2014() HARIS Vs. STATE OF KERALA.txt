                          Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 9th day of April, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This Criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in L.P.No.189/2010

(C.C.No.1228/2008) of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-III, Punalur, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

the settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Code (hereinafter called the `Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.413/2007 of

Pathanapuram Police Station, which was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the 2nd respondent as

defacto-complainant, alleging offences under Sections 294

(b), 323 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code.                                         After

investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on file

as C.C.No.1228/2008 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-III, Punalur. Since the petitioner did not

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                                     2

appear before the court, after complying with the

formalities, the case was transferred to the register of long

pending cases and it is now as L.P.No.189/2010 before that

court.    Now the matter has been settled between the

parties. The defacto-complainant has no grievance against

the petitioner. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case as well. Since some of

the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could

not file the compounding application before the court

below. So they have no other remedy, except to approach

this court, seeking the following relief:

            "In the interest of justice this Hon'ble Court may be
      pleased    to    quash    all   further    proceedings   in
      L.P.No.189/2010 (CC .No.1228/2008) of Judicial First
      Class    Magistrate    Court-III,     Punalur   in   Crime
      No.413/2007 of Pathanapuram Police Station, Kollam
      District by allowing the above criminal miscellaneous
      case."

            3.    2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled and the

defacto-complainant has no grievance against the petitioner

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                                 3

at present and their relationship has been restored as

before and he had filed Annexure-II affidavit stating these

facts. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that, in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

            4.    Learned Public prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that, except this case,

there is no other case pending against the petitioner and

opposed the application on the ground that he was

absconding.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, a case was

registered as Crime No.413/2007 of Pathanapuram Police

Station, against the present petitioner, alleging offences

punishable under Section 294(b), 323 and 341 of the Indian

Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed and it

was originally taken on file as C.C.No.1228/2008, on the file

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur, and

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                              4

since the petitioner did not appear before that court, it was

transferred to the register of long pending cases and it is

now pending as L.P.No.189/2010 before that court and now

the matter has been settled between the parties. It is seen

from the allegations in the final report that, the parties

were students studying in Engineering College and at that

time they belonged to KSU and SFI units of that College and

due to some misunderstanding, this incident happened.

Now they have restored the relationship. The matter has

been settled due to the intervention of mediators and

friends. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility of

conviction, as neither the defacto-complainant nor his

witnesses will support the prosecution.          Further 2nd

respondent has filed an affidavit stating that, in view of the

settlement, he does not want to prosecute the petitioner as

well, as the difference of opinion between them has been

resolved on account of the settlement.       Further it is a

dispute between two individuals during the college days,

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                                      5

while they were students and not an incident affecting the

public as such.

            6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.     Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
      the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
      from commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                                       6

      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings
      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
      settlement    and   compromise      between    the  victim   and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the
      answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
      Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."


            7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the incident

occurred at the time when they were students without

knowing the consequences and now the matter has been

settled between them, which resulted in restoration of their

friendship and no possibility of conviction on account of the

settlement and proceeding the case will only a wastage of

judicial time, this court feels that, it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the `Code' has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings in order to promote the restoration

Crl.M.C. No.2052 of 2014
                                 7

of friendship between the parties and pendency of this case

should not be a hurdle for the same. So, the petition is

allowed and further proceedings in L.P.No.189/2010

(C.C.No.1228/2008) of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

III, Punalur (Crime No.413/2007 of Pathanapuram Police

Station), as against the petitioner is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court,

for necessary further action.

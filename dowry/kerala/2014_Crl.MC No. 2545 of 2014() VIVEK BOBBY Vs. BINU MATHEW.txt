                Crl.M.C. NO. 2545 of 2014
            ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                             ORDER



      The petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Annexure A FIR

No.290/2014 registered for the offences punishable under

Sections 468, 471, 419, 497 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

The second petitioner, is the wife of the de facto complainant,

the first respondent herein. The marriage between the second

petitioner and the first respondent was irretrievably broken and

they were living separately for the last four years. The disputes

between the second petitioner and the first respondent were

settled amicably and both parties have agreed to withdraw all

pending cases including the crime in Annexure A FIR, which is

evident from Annexure B Memorandum of Agreement entered

into before the Mediation Centre of Family Court, Thiruvalla and

Annexure C affidavit of the first respondent filed before this

Court.     Therefore, the learned counsel submits that the

proceedings in Annexure A FIR may be quashed by this Court

invoking the powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

Crl.M.C. NO. 2545 of 2014         2




      2. Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, the learned

counsel for the first respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor

appearing for the second respondent.

      3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108, the

Apex Court held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the

purpose      of   quashing, particularly offences   arising   from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating to

dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

entire dispute. In these category of cases, High Court may quash

criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise

between the offender and the victim, the possibility of a

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

criminal case despite full and complete settlement and

compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court may

consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

Crl.M.C. NO. 2545 of 2014           3


of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process

of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

to the above question is in affirmative the High Court shall be

well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.    The allegation made against the petitioners are for

commission of offences punishable under Sections 468, 471,

419, 497 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Now as evident from

Annexure B Memorandum of Agreement and Annexure C

affidavit, the entire dispute between the second petitioner and

the first respondent has already been settled and the first

respondent has also stated that she has no intention to prosecute

the complaint filed against the petitioners.

      5. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings against the petitioners in FIR No. 290/2014 of the

Thiruvalla Police Station can be quashed by this Court invoking

the powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

in the light of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian

Sing's case supra.

Crl.M.C. NO. 2545 of 2014           4


      5.    In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in FIR No. 290/2014 of Thiruvalla Police Station is

quashed.

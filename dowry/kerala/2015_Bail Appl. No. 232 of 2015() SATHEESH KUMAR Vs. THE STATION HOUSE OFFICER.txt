               Dated this the 21st day of January 2015

                                    ORDER


      Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioner is the         accused in Crime No.39/2015 of

Kunnicode Police Station, Kollam district registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he had

tortured and harassed the de-facto complainant, who is his wife and

treated her with cruelty, within the the meaning of Section 498A of

the Indian Penal Code, by demanding her more dowry and by

complaining that she was not fair enough to be his wife.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor.

      5. The petitioner, as well as the de-facto complainant, are

B.A.232 of 2015                     2

teachers by profession and a child is born in their wedlock. This is

a matrimonial offence. For keeping alive the chance of re-union

and settlement in the matter, I am of the view that this is a fit case

wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      6.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge the petitioner on

bail in the event of his arrest on his executing a bond for 25,000/-

(Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each

for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

             (i)  The petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

      all Wednesdays and Saturdays commencing from

      28.1.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.


             (ii) The petitioner shall not tamper with the

B.A.232 of 2015                    3

      evidence or influence witnesses.

             (iii) The petitioner shall make himself available

      for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

             (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

                    .................................................
                       R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014
                    ..................................................
             Dated this the 2nd day of December, 2014.

                                  O R D E R


      The    counter petitioner in M.C.No.374/2011 of                       Family

Court, Palakkad is the                revision         petitioner herein.      The

respondents herein through the first                         respondent filed an

application for maintenance before the Family Court, Palakkad

under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the first respondent is

the wife of the revision petitioner and other respondents were

born to them in that wedlock. Their marriage was solemnized

on 7.5.2000. After four months of their marriage, the revision

petitioner started ill treating the first respondent both physically

and mentally demanding more dowry. He was even suspecting

the chastity of the first respondent and used to spread false

rumours against the first respondent. Since she felt that her

life will be in danger in the matrimonial                          home, she   was

compelled to leave the home. The revision petitioner used to

come to the parental house and abuse her.                              She filed a

complaint before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014           2

Chittur regarding the same. The first respondent has no income

of her own to maintain herself. The revision petitioner is a

toddy taper and getting Rs.500/- per day. He is capable of

paying maintenance. So they filed the petition.

         3. The respondent in the lower court filed counter

denying the allegations and also stated that he is not getting

so much income as mentioned and             first petitioner is having

sufficient income to maintain herself and children. The interim

maintenance was awarded during the pendency of the

proceedings. Since the revision petitioner did not pay interim

maintenance, the family court struck off his defence and the

first respondent was examined as PW1 and               relying on the

evidence of PW1, the family court allowed the petition directing

the revision petitioner to pay maintenance at the rate of

Rs.3,000/- to the first petitioner and Rs.2,500/- each to the

second and      third petitioners from the date of petition namely

18.11.2011. Aggrieved by the same, the present revision has

been filed by the      revision petitioner/counter petitioner before

the court below.

      4. Heard both sides.

      5. The counsel for the         revision petitioner    submitted

R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014          3

that there is no provision for striking off defence for non

payment of       interim maintenance and        illegality has been

committed by the the court below by striking off defence and

denying opportunity for the revision petitioner to cross examine

and adduce evidence.         The learned counsel relied on the

decision reported in Davis v. Thomas (ILR 2007 (4) Kerala

30) in support of his case.

       6. The      counsel for the respondents       submitted that

since the      revision petitioner   had not     complied with the

direction, court below was perfectly      justified in striking off

the defence and proceed with the case.

      7. It is an admitted fact that the respondents herein filed a

petition for maintenance as M.C.No.374/2011 before the Family

Court, Palakkad under section 125 of the Code and the learned

Family Court Judge granted interim maintenance at the rate of

Rs.2,000/- per month to the first respondent and          Rs.1,000/-

each to      respondents 2 and 3. The revision petitioner filed

Crl.M.C.No.212/2013 to set aside the ex parte interim order of

maintenance and the first respondent filed Crl.M.C.No.213/2013

to strike off the plea and contentions of the revision petitioner

on the ground that he did not comply with the direction of

R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014          4

payment of interim maintenance and the learned Family Court

Judge      dismissed      Crl.M.C.No.212/2013      and    allowed

Crl.M.C.No.213/2013 and struck off the defence and allowed

the main case as per the impugned order dated 23.6.2014

which is under challenge now.

      8. In the decision reported in Davi's case (cited supra),

this Court has held that an order of interim maintenance can

be passed only if there is a written application for interim

maintenance and in the same decision, it has been observed that

on failure to pay interim maintenance, the Magistrate cannot

strike off the defence relying on the decision reported in Vinod

v. Chhaya (2003 DMC 580) and Gurvinder Singh v. Mruthi

(1999 (1)     Crimes    18) and further observed that if interim

maintenance is not paid, the same can be realized by the

petitioners in the lower       court   just as   final order   for

maintenance.       In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decisions, the procedure       adopted  by the court below     by

striking   off the defence and     proceeding with the case and

passing the final order for maintenance is unsustainable in law

and the same is liable to be set aside.     But, at the same time,

this   Court feels that    some provisions   has to be made for

R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014          5

payment of interim maintenance to the petitioners in the lower

court as well. This Court has while staying the execution of

the order directed the revision petitioner to pay a consolidated

maintenance amount of Rs.3,000/- per month from the date of

petition     as ordered by the court below and that can be

maintained to be paid during the pendency of the proceedings

and that will meet the ends of justice as well, So the order

passed by the court below striking of the defence and passing

final order of maintenance in MC.No.374/2011 of Family

Court, Palakkad is set aside and the matter is remitted to the

court below for fresh disposal in accordance with law giving

opportunity to the      counter petitioner to cross examine  the

petitioners    and adduce evidence on the basis of the defence

taken by him in the counter and then pass appropriate orders

in accordance with law. In the meantime, the revision petitioner

is liable to pay interim maintenance at the consolidated rate of

Rs.3,000/-    to the petitioners in the lower court from the date

of petition in the lower court as directed by this Court as per

the order in Crl.M.A.No.7346/2014 and continue to pay this

amount during the pendency of the proceedings in the lower

court and if any default is committed, the respondents herein,

R.P.(F.C).No.428 of 2014             6

who are the petitioners         in the lower court, are entitled to

execute the same        through court         in accordance with law.

Parties a re directed to appear before the            court below on

31.12.2014. Considering the fact that the case is of the year

2011, the family court is directed to expedite the disposal of

the case as early as possible, at any rate, within three months

from the date of receipt of a copy of this order or appearance of

the parties before the court below as directed         by this Court,

which ever is earlier.

      With the above directions and observations, the revision

petition is allowed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

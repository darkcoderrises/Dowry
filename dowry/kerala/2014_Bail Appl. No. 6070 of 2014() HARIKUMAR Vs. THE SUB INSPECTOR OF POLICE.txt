                          V.K.MOHANAN,J.
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                      B.A.No. 6070 OF 2014
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
           Dated this the 25th       day of August , 2014


                               O R D E R


     The petitioners are accused in Crime No.1353/2014 of

Chengannoor       Police    station.     Apprehending        arrest,    they

preferred this application for anticipatory bail under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. As per the prosecution allegation, the first petitioner

married the defacto complainant on 11/2/2013 and thereafter,

while the defacto complainant was residing along with the

accused, she was subjected to cruelty demanding more dowry

and thus, according to the prosecution, the petitioners

committed offence punishable under Sections 498(A) & 324

read with Section 34 of the I.P.C.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A. No. 6070/2014             : 2 :




       4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

the above crime was registered in pursuance of the complaint

received by the Chengannoor Police from the Judicial First Class

Magistrate under Section 156 (3) of the Cr.P.C. , which preferred

by the defacto complainant.      According to the learned counsel,

the said fact is sufficient to show that the intention of the de

facto complainant is to harass the petitioners and if there is any

truth in the alleged offence, the defacto complainant ought to

have approached the police instead of filing a private complaint in

the court.

       5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted

that the main allegation is against the 3rd petitioner, who is the

mother of the first accused and wife of the 2nd accused. The

allegation is that she used to beat the defacto complainant by

using cane stick.       The submissions of the learned Public

Prosecutor shows that even if the said alleged overact is accepted

as true, it cannot be treated as part of demanding more dowry.

       7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, according to me, this petition can be allowed, however,

B.A. No. 6070/2014                 : 3 :




subject to the stringent conditions.

         In the result, there will be a direction that in the event of

arrest of the petitioners in connection with Crime No.1353/2014

of Chengannoor Police Station, they shall be released on bail on

the first petitioner     executing a bond for      Rs.35,000/-(Rupees

Thirty Five Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like amount to the satisfaction of the Investigation Officer in the

above crime and on the following conditions:

                (i). The first petitioner shall report before the

         Investigating Officer between 10 and 11 a.m. on

         Saturdays once in every fortnight.           The other

         petitioners    shall report before the Investigating

         Officer as and when required.

                ii).  The petitioners shall not involve in any

         criminal offence similar in nature.

                Iii). The petitioners shall not intimidate the

         witnesses or interfere with the investigation or

         attempt to tamper the evidence.

If the petitioners violate any of the conditions, the bail granted to

B.A. No. 6070/2014              : 4 :




them is liable to be cancelled.

       The Bail Application is accordingly allowed.

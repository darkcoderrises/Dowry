             Dated this the 2nd day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Petitioner is the first accused in Crime

No.38/2013 of Taliparamba Police Station, registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the

defacto complainant, who is the wife of the first accused,

and treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry and

gold ornaments. It is alleged that the petitioner severely

beat the defacto complainant with a wooden stool and belt,

on 06.01.2013, thereby causing severe injuries.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The contents

of the CD, prima facie, reveal the complicity of the

petitioner. The wound certificate, which finds a place

among the records in the CD, reveal that the defacto

complainant has sustained a contusion of 7x2 c.m., over

B.A. No. 2434 of 2013
                                  2

and behind her left shoulder, and a contusion of 7x5 c.m,

behind the back of abdomen. The history and alleged cause

of injury is also clearly noted in it, as assault by her

husband at his house, with stool and belt at 6.00 p.m on

06.01.2013. It seems that, the 31 year old lady was brutally

beaten and tortured. The wooden stool as well as belt were

the weapons used by the petitioner. The allegations against

the petitioner are very grave and serious. The weapons

used by the petitioner are yet to be recovered. The

custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required for the

continued investigation of this case. Considering the

seriousness of the allegations against the petitioner,

seriousness of the injuries sustained by the defacto

complainant, and the present stage of investigation, I am

satisfied that the petitioner is not entitled to the

discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

      In the result, this bail application is dismissed.

              ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 21st day of June, 2013


                           O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.2 and 3 in

C.C.No.847/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Attingal, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No. 358 of 2008 of Attingal Police Station

for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,

149, 323, 324, 427, 326 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings in the above C.C., as against

the petitioners, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2. The case of the prosecution is that on 5.6.2008

at about 1.30 p.m., the accused nos.1 to 3 while supplying

Biriyani in a marriage feast, the de facto complainant had

questioned the accused for shortage of masala in Biriyani

and due to that enmity, the accused attacked the de facto

                               2
Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2013


complainant and thereby they sustained injuries and thus

committed the offences punishable under section 323, 326,

427 r/w 34 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioners is that

the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case.       Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2013


         6.    I    have carefully considered  the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under sections 323,

326, 427 r/w section 34 of IPC, which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

                                     4
Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2013


settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                "57.     The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power given       to a   criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what     cases    power   to  quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

                "......... But the criminal cases having
         overwhelmingly       and    pre-dominatingly    civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

                                   5
Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2013


         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.               Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

Crl.M.C.No.2528 of 2013


         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No. 847 of 2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Attingal.

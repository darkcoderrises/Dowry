                   ================
                  Crl.M.C. No. 2089 of 2015
             =======================
              Dated this the 7th day of April, 2015

                           O R D E R



      Petitioners are accused in Crime No.694 of 2010 of the

Mavelikkara Police Station, Alappuzha District, registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.

      2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I Final Report in Crime

No.694 of 2010 of the Mavelikkara Police Station, Alappuzha

District and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.94 of

2011 pending before the Judicial First Class          Magistrate's

Court-I, Mavelikkara, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 2089 of 2015
                                  2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.                She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

                                     3

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I Final

Report in Crime No.694 of 2010 of the Mavelikkara Police

Station, Alappuzha District and all further proceedings based on

it in C.C.No.94 of 2011 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Mavelikkara, are hereby quashed.

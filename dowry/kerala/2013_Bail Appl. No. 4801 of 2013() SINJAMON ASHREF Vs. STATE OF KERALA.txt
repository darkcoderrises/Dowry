             Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R
                            ~~~~~~~


     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.255 of 2013 of

Alappuzha North Police Station registered for offences

punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 452, 498A and 379

read with 34 of Indian Penal Code.           He has filed the above

application for his release on bail under Section 439 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code').

     2.    The above crime was registered on a complaint filed

by wife of petitioner before the Magistrate and that being

referred to police for investigation and report under Section

156(3) of the Code. Petitioner, his parents and closeby relatives

are the accused in the crime, seven in number, alleging that all

of them tortured and harassed her demanding dowry. She was

subjected to both physical and mental harassment and on more

than one occasion she was assaulted by the accused persons,

and consequent to injuries sustained once she had to be

hospitalised, was her case.      Application for anticipatory bail

moved by accused numbers 3 to 7 was allowed by the Sessions

B.A.No.4801/2013                 2


Judge and request thereof canvassed by petitioner was turned

down. He was arrested on 24.6.2013 and, later, on production

before the magistrate, remanded to judicial custody.

      3.    Inviting my attention to the allegations raised in the

complaint and, further, complaint was belatedly moved before

Magistrate imputing an incident of assault, after committing

trespass in the house of the de facto complainant, more than two

weeks before, learned counsel for petitioner submitted that the

complaint was filed on false allegations with the sole intend to

harass the accused persons. Period of detention already suffered

by petitioner after his arrest is also emphasised by the counsel

for his release on bail submitting that he is prepared to abide by

any condition imposed by this Court. Investigation of the crime

is still continuing and the 2nd accused remains at large, is the

submission of learned Public Prosecutor to oppose the

application.

      4.    Case Diary has been produced for my perusal. After

looking into the Case Diary and also taking note of the

submissions made by counsel on both sides in the backdrop that

the crime has arisen over incidents emanating from matrimonial

B.A.No.4801/2013                     3


disputes of spouses, I find petitioner can be released on bail, at

this stage, subject to conditions safeguarding the investigation of

the crime. Petitioner is directed to be released on bail subject to

the following conditions:

         (i) Petitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.25,000/-
         with two solvent sureties for the like sum, by each of
         them, to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial
         Magistrate, Alappuzha.

         (ii) Petitioner shall report before the Magistrate once
         in a week, on every Monday, at a time between
         10.00 a.m. and 11.00 a.m., for a period of four weeks
         or till the completion of the investigation of the crime,
         whichever is earlier.

         (iii) Petitioner shall surrender his passport, if any,
         before the Magistrate, within one week from the date
         of his release, and, if not in possession of passport,
         then to file an affidavit stating so within the above
         period.

      Petition allowed.

                             O R D E R


     This is an application for anticipatory bail filed by

accused Nos. 1 & 2 in Crime No.271/2013 of Pazhayangadi

Police Station, under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     2.  The case of the prosecution, in a nutshell was that

the the 1st accused married the defacto complainant on

28.6.2009 and thereafter they were residing together as

husband and wife. While so, the accused persons were ill-

treating her demanding more dowry both physically and

mentally and thereafter caused miscarriage of her

pregnancy and she was sent to her house on 4.3.2012 and

thereby they have committed the offence punishable under

Section 498(A) of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

B.A. No.3720 of 2013
                                 -2-

that the petitioners have not committed any offence and

they are innocent of the same. It is also submitted that they

have been falsely implicated in the case. No offence under

Section 498 (A) is attracted.        It is only to harass the

petitioners that a false complaint has been filed. So, they

prayed for allowing the application.

       4.     The application was opposed by the learned

Public Prosecutor on the ground that the investigation is at

a preliminary stage.

       5.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the case diary

file produced.

       6.     It is seen from the case diary file that the above

case was originally registered on the basis of a statement

given by the defacto complainant, who is none other than

the wife of the 1st petitioner and daughter-in-law of the

2nd petitioner alleging commission of offence under Section

498 (A), 313 and 34 of Indian Penal Code.                During

investigation, it was revealed that no offence under Section

B.A. No.3720 of 2013
                                 -3-

313 of Indian Penal Code was committed and that section

was deleted.        It is also seen from the First Information

Statement of the defacto complainant that she was sent out

of the house on 4.3.2012 and this statement was given only

on 11.4.2013. However, I am not, at this stage, going into

the question whether the delay is fatal or not as it is a

matter for evidence to be considered by the trial court. The

custodial interrogation of the petitioners is not required in

connection with this case. Further merely on the basis of

the allegations of cruelty alone keeping the husband and in-

laws in jail        in a matrimonial offence at the stage of

investigation may affect the possibility of settlement

between          the  parties   later. So,  considering    the

circumstances, I feel that anticipatory bail can be granted

to the petitioners with some conditions. Accordingly, the

application is allowed subject to the following conditions:

        (1) The 1st respondent is directed to release the

              petitioners in the event of their arrest in

              connection with the above crime on executing a

B.A. No.3720 of 2013
                                  -4-

              bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five

              Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for

              the like sum to the satisfaction of the arresting

              officer/investigating officer/station house officer

              as the case may be.

        (2) The      petitioners   shall   appear    before    the

              Investigating   Officer   for   the   purpose     of

              interrogation    for    two     consecutive     days

              immediately after their arrest, between 9 am and

              10 a.m. and thereafter, as and when required by

              the investigating officer for this purpose in

              writing to do so, till the final report is filed and

              shall also co-operate with the investigation of the

              case.

        (3) The 1st petitioner is directed to surrender his

              passport either before the Investigating Officer or

              in case he surrenders before the court, surrender

              the passport before that court on the date of his

              surrender. If he is not having any valid passport,

B.A. No.3720 of 2013
                                   -5-

              he shall file an affidavit to that effect before that

              court.

        (4) The petitioners shall not intimidate or influence

              the witnesses.

        (5) The petitioners shall not leave the State of Kerala

              without getting permission from the Judicial First

              Class Magistrate Court-I, Payyannur, till the

              disposal of the case.

        (6) If the petitioners surrender before the Judicial

              First Class Magistrate Court-I, Payyannur and

              move    for   regular   bail,  then,        the learned

              Magistrate is directed to release the petitioners

              on bail on the same conditions as stated above.

        With the above conditions, the application is allowed.

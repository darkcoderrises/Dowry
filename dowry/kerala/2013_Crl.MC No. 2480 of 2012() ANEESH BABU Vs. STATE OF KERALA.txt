              ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.2480 of 2012
              ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013

                             ORDER

     The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.163 of

2010 of Beypore Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 498-A and 406 read with Section 34 of IPC.

The police after investigation filed a report based upon which

C.C.No.369 of 2011 was instituted. During the trial of the case,

accused Nos.2 and 3 were present but the petitioner/A1 was

not available and the said trial resulted in Annexure-V

judgment, by which the learned Magistrate acquitted the said

accused. Now the case of the petitioner is that, the matter is

settled out of court between himself and the de facto

complainant, who is the second respondent herein and

therefore seeks an order under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for

quashing Annexure-III report and all further proceedings in

C.C.No.17 of 2012 pending before the Special Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court (Marad Cases), Kozhikode.

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                              :-2-:

      2.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

counsel appearing for the second respondent and I have also

heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3.     As I indicated earlier, the above crime was

registered upon a complaint preferred by the second

respondent herein before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-V, Kozhikode alleging offence punishable under Sections

498(A) & 406 read with Section 34 of IPC. On receiving the

same, the said crime was registered and on completing the

investigation the police preferred Annexure-III report. Now

the case of the petitioner is that, the matter is settled out of

court between the petitioner and the de facto complainant,

who is the second respondent.        To substantiate the above

settlement the petitioner has produced Annexure-VI affidavit

which produced in Crl.M.Appln.No.4624 of 2013.

      4.     The learned counsel for the second respondent also

submitted that the second respondent has no interest in

proceeding with the Criminal case since the matter is settled

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                                         :-3-:

out of court especially when she had contracted another

marriage and now leading a peaceful family life. It is also the

case of the petitioner that, though the other accused faced

prosecution as per Annexure-V judgment, as the witnesses

turned hostile, they are acquitted. Therefore there is no

meaning in sending the petitioner herein for a trial.

      5. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of

the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra Raghuvanshi

and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1)

KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                                                 :-4-:

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

             case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

             injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

             despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim........"


Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Hon'ble Apex

Court has held as follows:-


                       "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

             considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

             under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

             also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

             matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

             home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                                             :-5-:

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                                            :-6-:

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                 13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent

         times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place and it has

         an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

         made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to settle

         down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults

         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

         fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in the

         matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

         extraordinary jurisdiction.    It is trite to state that the power under

         Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only

         when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings are

initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose among

the parties and both the disputes are now amicably settled

between the parties. According to me, in the light of the facts

and circumstances                involved          in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties

Crl.M.C.No.2480/2012

                             :-7-:

to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-III Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in C.C.No.17 of 2012 on the file of the

Special Judicial First Class Magistrate Court (Marad Cases),

Kozhikode.

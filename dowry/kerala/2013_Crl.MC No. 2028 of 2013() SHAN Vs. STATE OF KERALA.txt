                Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 24th day of June, 2013

                           ORDER

                 The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 5 in

Crime No. 606/2009 of Chadayamangalam Police Station for

the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,

324, 326, 308 r/w 149 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash the

Annexure 1 FIR and Annexure 2 Final Report in Crime

No.606/2009 of      Chadayamangalam Police Station and all

further proceedings pursuant to the same including S.C.

No.183/2011 on the file of Assistant Sessions Court,

Kottarakara, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that the

accused Nos.1 to 5 formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly on 1/9/2009 at about 2.30 p.m at Madanada

junction and in furtherance of their common intention to cause

grievous hurt to the defacto complainant due to their previous

animosity towards him. The accused persons came to the

place of occurrence in an autorikshaw and 1st accused inflicted

a cut injury with a knife on the defacto complainant, the 2nd

Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
                                2

accused beaten him with a pliers and the 5th accused beaten

him with a brick. The learned P.P on instruction submitted that

the injuries sustained by the defacto complainant is only

abrasion and counsel submitted that the case is settled out of

court since they are neighbors.

          3.      I have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners, as well as the second respondent and also heard

the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
                                    3

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324,

326, 308 r/w 149 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the

Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
                                      4

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........   But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
                                   5

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite       full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures -1 and 2          and all further proceedings pending

Crl.M.C. No. 2028 of 2013
                                  6

against       the     petitioners in Crime No.606/2009  of

Chadayamangalam Police Station and all further proceedings

thereto.

                         DATED: 10-12-2008

                                JUDGMENT


     Defendants 1 and 2 (who are husband and wife) in O.S.

41/1999     on the file of the Sub Court, Thiruvalla are the

appellants in this Second Appeal. The said suit was for recovery

of 40 soverigns of gold ornaments, furniture and utensils or their

value and further a sum of Rs. 25,000/- being the expenses for

celebrating the    marriage of the plaintiff             with the son of the

defendants. The trial court granted a decree for Rs. 1,75,000/-.

On appeal preferred by the defendants the lower appellate court

reduced the decree to Rs. 73,125/-.             Hence, this Second Appeal

by the defendants.

     2.    The following are the questions of law formulated in

the memorandum of Second Appeal :-

        i) In a suit for return of movables alleged to have been
           specifically entrusted to the defendants, can            the court
           grant a decree on             mere possibility when evidence
           adduced does not probabilize the alleged entrustment ?

R.S.A. No. 1027 of 2008              -:2:-

                Applying the principles of bailment can the court grant a
                decree, even if otherwise permissible based on on
                admission of the defendant as to different item ?


             ii)Whether the courts below interpreted and construed
                Ext.A1 document in the correct perspective ?

        3.      The facts which have been concurrently found by the

courts below are to the following effect :-

        The plaintiff Shymaja is the daughter of the sister of first

defendant           Anandadas.    The    second defendant Saraswathy

Amma is the wife of the first defendant. The marriage between

the plaintiff and Biju the son of the defendants was on 18-10-

98. The parties belong to the Hindu Ezhava community. At the

time of marriage          Shymaja was given 40 sovereigns of gold

ornaments as recorded in Ext.A1 marriage register maintained

by the S.N.D.P. Vaypor.           One month after the marriage in a

ceremony called "adukkalakanal" (visiting               the kitchen) the

parents of Shymaja gave her one almirah, one cot and also

presentation articles which had           been received at the time of

marriage. The post marital life of Shymaja in her matrimonial

home was full of miseries. She alleged that her husband used to

R.S.A. No. 1027 of 2008             -:3:-

physically torture her with demand of dowry. She also alleged

that her in-laws were also ill-treating her with such demands.

On 26-2-1999, according to the plaintiff, unable to bear the ill-

treatment and            corporal torture she ran away from her

matrimonial home and took asylum in the house of a relative. In

the same night her husband Biju committed suicide because he

was being blamed for the disappearance of Shymaja from the

matrimonial home. After the death of Biju, the plaintiff's father

made Ext.A3 demand for return of the 14 sovereign of gold

ornaments and the furniture              through the S.N.D.P. sakha.

Ext.A4 is the reply given by the defendants denying               the

statement          in Ext.A3 that the ornaments were entrusted with

them. They however expressed that they had no objection to

the plaintiff taking back the movables          if she   returned Rs.

35,000/- which she had taken              with her while leaving her

matrimonial home. Thereafter the plaintiff's father sent Ext.A2

notice dated 20-4-1999 repeating the demand under Ext.A3. No

reply was given to Ext.A2 lawyer notice. The suit was thereafter

filed.

        4.      Both the courts have held that as per Ext.A1 marriage

R.S.A. No. 1027 of 2008           -:4:-

register to which both the marital partners and their fathers are

signatories , 40 sovereigns of gold ornaments were given to

the plaintiff at the time of marriage. The trial court accepted the

said case of the plaintiff in its entireity to hold that the

defendants who were in custody of the ornaments and furniture

pursuant to the death of Biju are liable to return the same in

specie or their value totalling to a sum of Rs. 1,75,000/-. The

lower appellate court, however, came to the conclusion that even

though Ext.A1 marriage register would show that 40 sovereigns

were given to the plaintiff, according to the appellants she was

given ornaments worth only 15 sovereigns . Accordingly, the

lower appellate court held that the defendants         who are in

custody of the said 15 sovereigns of gold ornaments were liable

to return the same in specie or their value which was fixed at Rs.

58,125/- at the rate of Rs. 3875/- per sovereign. The value of

movables was fixed at Rs. 15,000/-. Thus the plaintiff was held

entitled to Rs. 73,165/- as against 1,75,000/- decreed by the

trial court.

        5.      Eventhough the learned counsel assailed the decrees

passed by the courts below on the premise that in the absence

R.S.A. No. 1027 of 2008                 -:5:-

of any case or evidence of entrustment of the gold ornaments

with the appellants, it was not permissible for the courts below

to presume            that the appellants were in custody of the gold

ornaments and pass a decree as above.

        6.      I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above

submissions. The conclusions reached by the courts below are

on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence adduced by

the parties.           Six witnesses were examined on the side of the

plaintiffs and three witnesses were examined on the side of the

appellants of whom Dws 1 and 2 are the appellants themselves.

The findings recorded and the conclusions reached are on the

basis of the evaluation of the oral and documentary evidence in

the case.           No question of law, much less, any substantial

question of law           arises for consideration   in this appeal. The

questions of law formulated in the memorandum of appeal also

do not arise for determination in this Second Appeal which is

accordingly dismissed in limine.

        Dated this the 10th day of December 2008.

                    CRL. M.C. No.6773 of 2014
            ...............................................................
            Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                   O R D E R


      Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.262/2014 of

the Tenhipalam Police Station, Malappuram registered for the

offence punishable under Sections 406 and 498A of the Indian

Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexures-A1 and A2 First

Information Report and final report respectively in Crime No.

262/2014 of the Tenhipalam Police Station, Malappuram and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.1998/2014 pending

before    the    Judicial         First      Class        Magistrate's       Court-I,

Parappanangadi, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry,

after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.   The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.            She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit

has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own

volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexures-A1

and A2 First Information Report and final report in Crime No.

262/2014 of the Tenhipalam Police Station, Malappuram and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.1998/2014 pending

before    the  Judicial   First   Class   Magistrate's  Court-I,

Parappanangadi, are hereby quashed.

            Dated this the 18th day of November, 2014

                                   ORDER

      The petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime No.74

of 2014 of Adhur Police Station, Kasaragod District, presently

pending as C.C. No.3533 of 2014 before Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, have come up, under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure, for getting the proceedings in the

Annexure-1 F.I.R., quashed.

      2. The crime has been registered for offences punishable

under Section 323, 403, 498A and 506(ii) of the Indian Penal Code

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The allegations

against the petitioners is that they had tortured and harassed the de-

facto complainant, who is the wife of the first petitioner, and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry after

Crl.M.C.6382/ 2014                  2

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

       3. The parties are Muslims. It seems that all the pending

disputes between the parties have been settled through a

compromise and an agreement has been entered into. The parties

have effected an extra judiciary divorce. According to the

petitioners, all the disputes have been settled and the amounts due

to the de-facto complainant, were paid.

       4. The de-facto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit stating that the matter has been settled

and presently she has no complaints against the petitioners. She

has also prayed for quashing the proceedings based on Annexure-1

F.I.R.

       5. The 2nd respondent has entered appearance through her

counsel. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has also

endorsed the affidavit sworn in by the 2nd respondent and the

matters involved in the case have already been settled. When the

Crl.M.C.6382/ 2014                 3

matters are settled, there is no meaning in proceeding further in the

matter and therefore, Annexure-I F.I.R., the final report in C.C.

No.3533 of 2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Kasaragod and the proceedings in the said case, are only to be

quashed, and I do so.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, and Annexure-I F.I.R.,

the final report in C.C. No.3533 of 2014 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod and also the further proceedings in

the said case are quashed.

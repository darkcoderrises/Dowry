           ---------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                           ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.1062/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thiruvananthapuram

which is a case instituted upon the police report for the

offences punishable under Sections 120B, 406, 420, 506(i) and

r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash all proceedings

as against the petitioners in Annexure A final report, pending

as C.C.No.1062/2012 pending on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Thiruvananthapuram as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the final report is that A1 who

joined as a police constable in Kerala Police Service during the

year 1998, with an intention to cheat CW1 and CW2 who are

his subordinates and CW3 who is the friend of CW1 and to

make illegal gain, he along with A2 after conspiring criminally

told CW1 and CW2 that A2 is suffering from cancer and for her

treatment he need Rs.2 lakhs and thereby induced them to

Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
                               2

stood as sureties by using their salary certificates before the

Thiruvananthapuram Urban Bank, Manacaud Branch. Further,

CW3 also stood as surety as per the request of CW1 by which

the petitioners availed a loan for Rs.1,80,000/- and failed to

repay the loan amount.     Therefore, the bank recovered the

due amount from the salary of CW1. When CW1 asked A1 to

repay the loan amount, he criminally intimidated him. Thus,

according to the prosecution the accused has committed the

offences punishable under Sections 120B, 406, 420, 506(i) and

r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. The petitioners is that during the

pendency of the above case the entire dispute is settled with

the defacto complainant who is the second respondent and

respondents 3 and 4 who are another victim. The respondents

2 to 4 are respectively sworn into Annexures- B to D affidavits.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
                               3

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 120B, 406, 420, 506(i)

and r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
                                       4

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                   "57.   The position that emerges from the

           above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

           power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

           inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

           the power given to a criminal court for compounding

           the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

           power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

           the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

           the process of any Court. In what cases power to

           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

           may be exercised where the offender and victim

           have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

           and circumstances of each case and no category can

           be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But    the    criminal    cases    having

Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
                                     5

         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

         stand on different footing for the purposes of

         quashing, particularly the offences arising from

         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

         or such like transactions or the offences arising out

         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

Crl.M.C.No.3730 of 2013
                                6

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.1062/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram.

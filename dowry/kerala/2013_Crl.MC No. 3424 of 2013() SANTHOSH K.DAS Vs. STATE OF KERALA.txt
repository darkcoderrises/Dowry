               ------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
               -------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners among which the 1st petitioner is the sole

accused and 2nd petitioner is the de facto complainant in

Crime No.539 of 2013 of Mananthavady Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 & 294(b) of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A2 F.I.R. in Crime

No.539 of 2013 of Mananthavady Police Station as the matter

is settled out of court.

     2.    The petitioners are husband and wife among which

the husband is the accused and wife is the de facto

complainant. The allegation is that on 27/05/2013 at about 10

a.m. the first petitioner/husband calling obscene words and

manhandled his wife/the de facto complainant, who is the

second petitioner herein and thus the first petitioner

committed the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323,

Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
                              :-2-:


324 & 294(b) of IPC. Now, according to the first petitioner,

who is the accused and de facto complainant, more over

husband and wife, they have settled the disputes and now they

are residing together happily and leading peaceful marital life

and the second petitioner does not want to prosecute against

her husband, who is the first petitioner/accused. Accordingly,

the first petitioner has sworn into Annexure-A3 affidavit and

the second petitioner has also sworn into Annexure-4 affidavit.

Besides the above, both of them have filed Annexure-A5 a joint

statement of compromising the entire dispute.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the first petitioner as

well as the 2nd petitioner. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.  The learned counsel for the first petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
                             :-3-:


     5.    I have carefully considered the above submission of

the learned counsel.      I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323, 324 & 294

(b) of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

petitioners, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the first petitioner/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
                                  :-5-:


        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.3424 of 2013
                            :-6-:


         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 F.I.R. in Crime No.539 of 2013 of Mananthavady

Police Station and all further proceedings thereto against the

1st petitioner/accused.

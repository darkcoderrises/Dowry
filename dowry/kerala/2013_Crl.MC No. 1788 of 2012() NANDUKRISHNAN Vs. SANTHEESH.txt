               ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.1788 of 2012
               ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.24 of 2012 of the

Juvenile Justice Board, Ramavarmapuram, Thrissur.

        2.       C.C.No.24 of 2012 is instituted in the Juvenile

Justice Board, Ramavarmapuram, Thrissur on the basis of the

report filed by the police after investigation in Crime No.588

of 2011 of Irinjalakuda Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 & 326 read

with Section 149 of IPC and 27 of Arms Act, 1959. The alleged

incident had taken place connected with a temple festival.

Now the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out

of court. Annexure AV is the affidavit of the first respondent,

who is the de facto complainant, which is also signed by

respondents 2 and 3, who are the injured.

Crl.M.C.No.1788/2012

                               :-2-:

         3.        Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-AV affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the     case      and   especially   in  the    light  of   the

Crl.M.C.No.1788/2012

                             :-3-:

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,

324 & 326 read with Section 149 of IPC and 27 of Arms Act,

1959 which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the first

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them.      In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)], in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.1788/2012

                                              :-4-:

                       "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

Crl.M.C.No.1788/2012

                                            :-5-:

         this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

         its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled

the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.1788/2012

                             :-6-:

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A1 F.I.R. and final report pending against the

petitioner in C.C.No.24 of 2012 of the Juvenile Justice Board,

Ramavarmapuram, Thrissur (in Crime No.588 of 2011 of

Irinjalakuda Police Station).

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.306/2008 of

Binanipuram Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioner has come up with this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in

Crime No.306/2008 of Binanipuram Police Station as

against the petitioner and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C.376/2009 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, North Parur, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Crl.M.C.6538/2014
                              : 2 :



Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto  complainant,     who    is  the    1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

Crl.M.C.6538/2014
                                 : 3 :



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.306/2008 of Binanipuram Police

Station as against the petitioner and all further proceedings

based on it in C.C.376/2009 pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court, North Parur are hereby

quashed.

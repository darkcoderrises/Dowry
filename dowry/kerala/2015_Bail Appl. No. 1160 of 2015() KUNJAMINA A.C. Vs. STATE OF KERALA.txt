                       B.KEMAL PASHA, J.
              ============================
                       B.A.No.1160 of 2015
              ============================
                Dated this the 26th day of March, 2015


                             O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2. The petitioners are A2, A3 and A5 in Crime No.18 of

2015 of the Payangadi Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

     3. The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is the wife of the 1st accused, and treated

her with cruelty, by demanding more dowry and gold

ornaments.

     4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A.No.1160/2015                 2

      5. The crime has been registered on the basis of a

private complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Payyannur, which was

referred to the Police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.        Even

though physical harassment is also alleged, any wound

certificate has not been procured. This is a matrimonial

offence, in which the possibility of settlement or compromise

cannot be brushed aside at present. Considering the said

aspect, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge

the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on each of

them executing a bond for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each

to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject

to the following terms and conditions:-

           (i)  Petitioners     shall  report    before   the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and 11.00

B.A.No.1160/2015                   3

     a.m. on all Thursdays and Mondays commencing from

     02.04.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing

     of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

             (ii)  Petitioners shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

             (iii) Petitioners shall make themselves available

     for interrogation as and when required by the

     investigating officer.

             (iv) Petitioners shall not involve in any offence

     while on bail.



       It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

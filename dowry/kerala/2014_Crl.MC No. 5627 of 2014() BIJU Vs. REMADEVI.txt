                    Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014
                  ---------------------------------
           Dated this the 20th day of October, 2014.

                             O R D E R


     The three petitioners herein are arrayed as accused

Nos.2, 3 & 4 in Annexure-B FIR in Crime No.1071/2013 of

Nooranad Police Station for offences alleged under Sections

201, 406, 417, 420 & 34 IPC.              The case arose out of

Annexure-A C.M.P.No.8450/2013 filed as a private criminal

complaint by the defacto complainant (1st respondent herein)

before the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned. The police after

investigation submitted Annexure-C Final Report/Charge Sheet

in the impugned Annexure-B Crime No.1071/2013 of Nooranad

Police  Station    which    has    led    to   the  institution of

C.C.No.238/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Mavelikkara.          The allegation of the

prosecution is that the defacto complainant is the registered

owner of the JCB bearing registration No.Kl-31-A-3992 and

that she rented out the vehicle to accused No.1 for daily rent

of Rs.3,000/- per day and thereafter the said vehicle was

returned back to the defacto complainant and the 1st accused

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014

sold the vehicle tot he 2nd accused and thereafter accused No.2

sold the vehicle to accused No.3 and thereafter accused No.3

in turn sold the vehicle to accused No.4 and that accused No.4

dismantled the vehicle into parts and transferred the same to

Thrissur District. It is urged that the petitioners are innocent

in this matter and they have no connection with the 1st

respondent (defacto complainant) and the 1st accused. It is

stated that no sale agreement or sale letter has been

recovered from the petitioners and produced along with

Annexure-C Final Report/Charge Sheet that the petitioners are

falsely implicated in the said crime that the impugned criminal

proceedings against the petitioner pursuant to Annexure-C

Final Report/Charge Sheet which has led to the pendency of

C.C.No.238/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Mavelikkara is an abuse of process of

court and if it is allowed to be continued, it will cause severe

damage and irreparable injury and hardship to the petitioner,

it is averred.    It is in the conspectus of these facts and

circumstances, petitioners have filed the above said Crl.M.C

seeking invocation of powers conferred under Section 482

                              ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014

Cr.P.C with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-C

Final Report/Charge Sheet in the impugned Annexure-B FIR in

Crime No.1071/2013 of Nooranad Police Station which has led

to the institution of C.C.No.238/2014 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Mavelikkara and all further

proceedings arising therefrom.

      2.   Heard Sri.R.B.Rajesh, learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the

2nd respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   The learned counsel for the petitioner, during the

course of the submissions, relied on paragraph 61 of the

decision of the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

and Anr. reported in (2013) 1 SCC (Cri.) 160 = (2012) 10

SCC 303, wherein it was held that the criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and predominately civil flavour stand on a

different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly the

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out

of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes

where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature etc.

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014

That in the instant case, the allegations arose solely out of an

alleged sale transaction in respect of a vehicle and that the

impugned final report/charge sheet is liable to be quashed

under Sec.482 Cr.P.C. on account of the factual aspects stated

hereinabove. The Apex Court in aforementioned Gian Singh's

case cited supra, after surveying many conditions of the Apex

Court on the point, has categorically held that the inherent

power of the High Court under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. is wide

plenitude with no statutory limitation and is to be exercised (i)

to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent the abuse of the

process of any court (iii) to do real, complete and substantial

justice.    In Inder Mohan Goswasmi v. State of

Uttaranchal reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1, the Apex Court

has held that every High Court has the inherent powers to act

ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the

administration of which the court exists or to prevent abuse of

process of the court and it is contended by the learned counsel

for the petitioners that the principles laid down by the Apex

Court in those decisions would squarely apply in the facts of

the present case.

                              ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014

      4.   The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the prayer.

The learned counsel for the petitioners then submitted that the

petitioners may be given the liberty to approach the court

below with the plea for discharge and the same may be

directed to be considered and further that they may be

permitted to move an appropriate application under Sec. 205

of the Cr.P.C. for exempt them from personal appearance

during the considerations of the plea of discharge, till orders

are passed thereon by the court below.

      5.   In the circumstances, it is ordered in the interest of

justice, that it is open to the petitioners to file appropriate

application seeking the plea of discharge in this case before the

court below and in case the stage for consideration of the plea

of discharge has not yet been crossed, then the court below

shall consider the same on merits and in accordance with law,

after reasonable to the petitioners and the prosecution. It is

further ordered in the interest of justice that in case the

petitioners file appropriate application under Sec. 205 of the

Cr.P.C. seeking exemption of their personal appearance from

the court below during the consideration of the plea of

                              ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5627 Of 2014

discharge until orders are passed thereon, the court below

shall consider the said prayer and permit exemption from the

personal appearance of the petitioners during the stage of

consideration of the discharge plea, until orders are passed

thereon.

      With these observations and directions, the Crl.M.C.

stands finally disposed of.




                                       ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                               Judge.

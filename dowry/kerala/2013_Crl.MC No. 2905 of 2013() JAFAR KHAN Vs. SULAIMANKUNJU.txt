                  Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 16th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

     The petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.192 of

2004 of Paravur Police Station where the offences involved are

under Sections 341, 323, 308 & 34 of IPC. According to the

petitioner, though the other accused in the above crime faced

prosecution on two occasions, which resulted in Annexures-2

and 3 judgments and they are acquitted, since the matter is

settled out of court. So, according to the petitioner he is also

entitled to get the benefit of the above judgments and hence

he preferred the above Crl.M.C. under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-1 Final Report and all further

proceedings in L.P.No.8 of 2008 on the file of the court of the

Additional District and Sessions Judge (Ad hoc)II Kollam.

     2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the learned Public Prosecutor.

     3.   The prosecution allegation is that, on account of

previous enmity towards CW.3, at 7.30 p.m. on 30/05/2004 at

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                               :-2-:


the public road which is proceeding from Padippura Junction

to Kongal Thekkathil in Kongal Cheriyil, Kottarappuram Village

in furtherance of the common intention accused No.1

wrongfully restrained CW.3 by catching hold on the collar of

his shirt and gave a blow on him. On seeing the occurrence,

CW.2 intervened and at that time accused No.1 advanced a

stab towards the chest of CW.2 and he tried to avoid the same

causing injuries on the left side of his abdomen and the

accused No.1 again stabbed on the body of CW.1 causing

injury. Accused Nos.2 to 4 gave blows and fisted on different

parts of the bodies of CWs.1 and 2 and had CW.2 not tried to

avoid the stab advanced towards his chest, he would have died

and that thereby the accused committed the offences

punishable under the above mentioned sections.

     4.    In the light of the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner, I have carefully perused Annexures-

2 and 3 judgments and it appears that the prosecution has

miserably failed to establish the case against the accused

solely for the reason that all the witnesses turned hostile to the

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                              :-3-:


prosecution and the prosecution has also dispensed with the

examination of the remaining witnesses. It is also relevant to

note that the first respondent, who is the de facto complainant

has sworn into an affidavit dated 13/07/2013 and thus,

according to the petitioner as well as the de facto complainant,

who is the first respondent herein, the matter is settled out of

court.

        5.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        6. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                             :-4-:


        7. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

        8.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323, 308 & 34

of IPC. which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 1st

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioner/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                                  :-6-:


        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2905 of 2013
                             :-7-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner alone in L.P.No.8 of 2008 on the file of

the court of the Additional District and Sessions Judge (Ad hoc)

II, Kollam.

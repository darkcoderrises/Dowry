                     THOMAS P.JOSEPH, J.
              ---------------------------------------------
                      R.S.A.No.505 of 2012
              ----------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of May, 2012

                             JUDGMENT

     Additional 5th defendant in O.S.No.82 of 2000 of the Sub

Court, Perumbavoor is the appellant challenging the dismissal of

I.A.No.414 of 2007 filed by her under order XX Rule 18 read

with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure as confirmed by

the learned Additional District Judge, North Paravur in

A.S.No.33 of 2009.

     2.    As the trial court has observed, this case has a tragic

history. After the preliminary decree for partition was passed,

the first defendant (husband of appellant) allegedly committed

murder of the second plaintiff, his sister and then committed

suicide. After the death of the first defendant, appellant, his

wife was impleaded as additional 5th defendant in the proceeding

for passing final decree pursuant to I.A.No.411 of 2007. In that

proceeding, appellants/additional 5th defendant filed I.A.No.414

of 2007 to exclude an item of property from the final decree

proceeding and to allow her realise certain amount with charge

R.S.A.No.505/2012
                                  2


over other properties.      Her claim was that the said item of

property sought to be excluded though purchased in the name of

her father-in-law (father of the first defendant), was with her

dowry.       The application was opposed by the contesting

respondents. Learned Sub Judge dismissed the application which

learned Additional District Judge has confirmed in A.S.No.33 of

2009.

      3.    Learned counsel for appellant has submitted that the

trial and first appellate courts have not referred to the evidence of

PWs.1 to 3 in the proper manner.          According to the learned

counsel, the father-in-law stood in a fiduciary relationship with the

appellant. In the matter of entrustment of dowry amount, Section

82 of the Indian Trust Act (for short, "the Act") applied and in the

circumstances courts below ought to have found that purchase of

property was done in the name of father-in-law with the funds of

the appellant. She is the real owner of the property and hence it

is liable to be exempted from the final decree proceeding.

      4.    Learned counsel who filed caveat on behalf of 7th

respondent contended that the plea of appellant cannot be

accepted.      There is no reliable evidence to show that the

R.S.A.No.505/2012
                                3


acquisition under Ext.A2 was benami for and on behalf of the

appellant and placed for reliance of the decision in Aliyamma Vs.

Thomas (2006(4)KLT 106) where it is held that the mere fact that

dowry amount was utilised for the benefit of the husband's family

would not confer right on the wife to claim share in the family

property of the husband.

      5.    Appellant gave evidence as PW.1. She examined PWs.2

and 3 to show that a sum of Rs.800/- was given on behalf of her to

her father-in-law as dowry at the time of her marriage in the year,

1958 and to say that the property under Ext.A2 was acquired

making use of Rs.500/- out of the said sum of Rs.800/-. It is the

balance sum of Rs.300/- which the appellant wanted to realise

with charge over other properties.

      6.    It has come in evidence that appellant was married to

the deceased first defendant in April, 1958 according to the

appellant, when she was aged only 14 years. The acquisition as

per Ext.A2 was made by the father-in-law of the appellant in April,

1959. It is not disputed and in Ext.A2, it is stated that the sale

consideration came from the vendee, ie., the father-in-law of the

appellant.    It also came out in evidence that at the time the

R.S.A.No.505/2012
                                  4


acquisition was made as per Ext.A2, deceased first defendant was

aged about 19 years.      A further fact which has emerged in

evidence is that deceased first defendant, during his life time

executed Exts.B1 and B2 in respect of the property in favour of his

children claiming that the said property belonged to his father

(father-in-law of the appellant), obviously as per the Ext.A2.

      7.    Learned counsel for appellant in fairness submits that,

though deceased first defendant while challenging the preliminary

decree in Appeal had raised a contention that the property now

under claim was acquired by his father with the funds of the

appellant, no such contention was raised in the trial court. It is

also admitted that the preliminary decree was confirmed by the

first appellate court.   The Second Appeal at the instance of

deceased first defendant failed and a petition for review of that

judgment also ended in a dismissal.

      8.    Now the question is whether finding of the courts

below that the plea of benami is not established involve any

substantial questions of law requiring decision by this Court.

      9.    There are various circumstances which the person

pleading benami is to plead and prove to substantiate that plea. It

R.S.A.No.505/2012
                                   5


is not shown what was the motive of the father-in-law to acquire

the property allegedly with the funds of the appellant in his name

under Ext.A2 in April, 1959 when the acquisition could have been

made in the name of the appellant, even if she was a minor,

represented by guardian and at any rate, in the name of the

deceased first defendant who by then was aged 19 years. It is

true that PWs.1 to 3 have stated that a sum of Rs.800/- being the

amount of dowry was entrusted with the father-in-law and that

amount was used for acquisition of the property as per Ext.A2.

The trial and first appellate courts noticed that the alleged

entrustment of the dowry amount was in April, 1958 while the

acquisition as per Ext.A2 was in April, 1959 and that there is no

sufficient evidence to show that the sale consideration for Ext.A2

was from the dowry amount allegedly paid to the father-in-law of

appellant. Various other circumstances required to prove a plea

of benami are absent in this Appeal. There is no findings that

appellant is in possession and enjoyment of the property, though

the father-in-law is its ostensible owner.

      10. No doubt, appellant stands in very difficult situation on

account of the death of her husband. But, that is no reason why I

R.S.A.No.505/2012
                                 6


should interfere with the concurrent finding rendered by the

courts below on the facts and evidence.

      11. As rightly pointed out by the courts below there is no

sufficient evidence to accept the plea of benami. If that be so, the

question of application of Section 82 of the Act does not arise.

      12. No substantial question of law is involved in this

matter.

            Hence, the Second Appeal is dismissed.

                        V.K.MOHANAN, J.
                    ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.Nos. 1676 & 1678 of 2013
                    ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 17th day of July, 2013

                                 O R D E R

            As the above two Crl.M.Cs. are preferred against the

proceedings initiated on the basis of the case and counter case and the

parties to the proceedings in the above cases are same, and the subject

matter is connected with the incident taken place on 4.3.2012, according to

me, these Crl.M.Cs. can be taken for hearing together and disposed of by

this common order.

      2.   Crl.M.C.No.1676 of 2013 is directed against the committal

proceedings pending in C.P.No.126 of 2012 in the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Varkala which was instituted on the basis of the report

in Crime No.278 of 2012 of Kallambalam Police Station, whereas

Crl.M.C.No.1678 of 2013 is directed against the proceedings              in

C.P.No.127 of 2012 of the above court, which was instituted upon on the

basis of report in Crime No.279 of 2012 of the same Police Station.

Crl.M.C.No.1676 of 2013 is preferred by accused Nos. 1 to 6 in Crime

Crl.M.C.Nos.1676 & 1678 of 2013
                                    :-2-:

No.278 of 2012 in which the contesting respondents are CW1 and CW2,

who are the de facto complainant             and the injured whereas in

Crl.M.C.No.1678 of 2013, the petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 in Crime

No.279 of 2012 of the Kallambalam Police Station and therein, the second

respondent is the de facto complainant. The alleged incident has taken

place connected with the compromise talk with respect to an earlier

incident between the third accused in Crime No.278 of 2012 and the

brother of the CW1 in the very same crime. Now, the case of the parties to

the above two crimes is that the whole incident originated due to the

difference of opinion of two fraction of students and subsequently, the

entire dispute is sorted out and settled. Therefore, the prayers in both the

above petitions are to quash the proceedings pending against the

petitioners in the above cases as the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the counsel for the petitioners in the above case and

also the counsel representing the contesting respondents.

         4. The learned Public Prosecutor is also of the opinion that as

the matter is settled out of court, especially the dispute is between the two

Crl.M.C.Nos.1676 & 1678 of 2013
                                     :-3-:

fraction of students, the settlement can be recorded.

          5. In Crl.M.C.No.1676 of 2013, the de facto complainant, who is

the second as well as the third respondents, who are the injured sworn to

Annexures C and D affidavits respectively. Similarly in Crl.M.C.No.1678

of 2013, the second respondent who is the de facto complainant sworn to

Anenxure C affidavit.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along

with the above petitions. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, as I indicated earlier, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no

objection in allowing the above petitions.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

cases, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above cases are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the respondents concerned, it appears to me

Crl.M.C.Nos.1676 & 1678 of 2013
                                           :-4-:

that the injured/the de facto complainant have no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
           can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

Crl.M.C.Nos.1676 & 1678 of 2013
                                      :-5-:

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.Cs. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

           In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed, quashing all further

proceedings in Annexure B final report pending as C.P.No.126/2012 of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Varkala against the accused therein, who are the

petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1676 of 2013 and quashing all further proceedings

Crl.M.C.Nos.1676 & 1678 of 2013
                                   :-6-:

against the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1678 of 2013, who are the accused in

Annexure B final report and in C.P.No.127/2012 of the very same court.

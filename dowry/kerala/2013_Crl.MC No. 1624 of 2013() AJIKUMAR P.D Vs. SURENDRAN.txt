                      Crl.M.C.No. 1624 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No.1068 of 2012 of

Konni Police Station for the offence punishable under Section 498 A

read with 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure- I FIR

registered by the Konni Police Station against the petitioners and the

entire proceedings based on Crime No.1068 of 2012 registered by the

Konni Police Station as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 11.12.2012 at

about 7 p.m., they assaulted and tortured the second respondent, who

is the wife of the first petitioner. It is alleged that due to the mental

pain caused in connection with the above said incident, the second

respondent attempted to commit suicide by consuming poison on

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                :-2-:

11.12.2012. Thus, it is alleged that the petitioners have committed the

offence and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled

out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first and second respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first and second respondents,

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, first respondent is the de facto

complainant and the second respondent is the wife of the first

petitioner, do not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                 :-3-:

and they have no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition and Annexure 2 affidavit is

produced.     In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case is

Section 498 Aread with 34 of I.P.C. , which is more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offence is involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From

the submission made by the counsel for the first and second

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto complainant and his

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                            :-4-:

wife have no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision reported in

Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

         considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

         also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

         home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.


                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                             :-5-:

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in

         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                            :-6-:

         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort

         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their

         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice

         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power

         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A

of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated

from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the

parties want a quietus to the criminal case as well.

         8.      According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision will be squarely applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2013
                                  :-7-:

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I

FIR registered by the Konni Police Station against the petitioners and

the entire proceedings based on Crime No.1068/2012 registered by the

Konni Police Station.

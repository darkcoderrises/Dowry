                  -------------------------------
          Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                  -------------------------------
      Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013.


                          O R D E R


     As the above two M.Cs. are directed against case and

counter case and as the dispute, as per the submission of

the counsel, was settled, the above two M.Cs. are heard

together and being disposed by this common order.

Crl.M.C.No.3803/13 is directed against Crime No.313/13 of

Malampuzha police station at the instance of the accused

therein and the 2nd respondent herein is the de facto

complainant in the above crime. Whereas, Crl.M.C.No.3826

of 2013 is filed against Crime No.314/13 at the instance of

accused therein and the 2nd respondent is the de facto

complainant in the above crime and he is the 1st petitioner

in  Crl.M.C.No.3803/13.       The    above     two crimes are

registered as case and counter, connected with the

incident taken place at 13.45 hrs. on 23.3.2013 and the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                                    2

reason for the incident was due to previous animosity.

However, as the matter is settled out of court, I am not

proposed to go into the details of the allegation against the

petitioners in the above cases in the above crimes.

Showing the settlement arrived and expressing no objection

in     quashing        FIR       against   the  petitioners  in

Crl.M.C.No.3803/13, the de facto complainant therein, who

is the 2nd respondent in the above M.C. had sworn into

Annexure 2 affidavit. Similarly, the de facto complainant in

Crime      No.314/13,        who   is   the  2nd respondent  in

Crl.M.C.No.3826/13 had also sworn into Annexure B

affidavit in the same line.

         2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents.          I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crimes, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crimes.          Therefore, the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                                    3

continuation of the proceedings in the above crimes is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who are

the de facto complainants do not intends to proceed any

further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

         6.       I   have     carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petitions. In the given facts and circumstances of the cases

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petitions.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above cases are only under sections 143,

147, 148, 341, 324, 308 r/w 149 of IPC, which are more or

Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                                     4

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me

that the de facto complainants have no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

               "57.    The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given    to  a  criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what    cases    power    to  quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts

Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                                    5

         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But     the  criminal  cases     having
         overwhelmingly        and  pre-dominatingly    civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present cases and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present cases.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

Crl.M.C.Nos.3803 and 3826 of 2013
                                     6

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, these

Criminal M.Cs. can be allowed granting the reliefs as

sought for.

              In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed,

quashing Annexure-1 FIR (Crl.M.C.No.3803/13) in Crime

No.313/2013 of Malampuzha police station and Annexure-A

FIR     (Crl.M.C.No.3826/13)         in   Crime No.314/2013 of

Malampuzha police station and and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners thereto.

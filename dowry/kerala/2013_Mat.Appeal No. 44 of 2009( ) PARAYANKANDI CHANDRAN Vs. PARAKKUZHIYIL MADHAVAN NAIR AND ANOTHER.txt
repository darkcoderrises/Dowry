              ANTONY DOMINIC & P.D.RAJAN, JJ.
             ========================
                 Mat. Appeal No. 44 OF 2009
              =======================

             Dated this the 17th day of July, 2013

                         J U D G M E N T


Antony Dominic, J.

     Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned

counsel for the respondents.

     2.    The appellant had married the 2nd respondent on

15/6/1994. In their wedlock, two male children were born and

according to the parties, they are now 19 years and 15 years

respectively. According to the appellant, the wife was suffering

from mental illness and on the aggravation of which, she was

hospitalized also. It is stated that, even thereafter, the situation

continued and reached a point when the marital life could not be

carried on. In such circumstances, according to the appellant, 1st

respondent and the brother of the 2nd respondent wife took her to

her parental home along with the children. It was thereafter that

the appellant filed OP No.717/2006 before the Family Court,

Kozhikode seeking divorce.

     3.    Respondents entered appearance and filed their

objections. In the objections, the respondents contended that

Mat.Appeal No.426/09
                                 :  2 :



though the 2nd respondent had mental illness, that was treated

and cured. It was also contended that the appellant who is related

to them was aware of the mental illness and that he knowingly

married her attracted by the dowry and other wealth she

possessed. It is stated that after reaching the matrimonial home,

it was on account of the ill treatment suffered by the 2nd

respondent that the disease again developed. According to them,

she was treated thereafter and is completely cured.             On this

ground, respondents sought dismissal of the petition.

     4.     Before the Family Court, oral evidence was adduced by

PWs 1 and 2 and RWs 1 to 3. Exts.A1 to A7 and Exts.B1 and B2

were also marked. Finally, the Family Court dismissed the petition

by its order dated 26th of November, 2008. The reasoning of the

Family Court is reflected in para 10 of the order and the relevant

portion of which reads thus;

       "In evidence PW1 stated that within 2 months of their
       marriage, he came to know about the illness of the 2nd
       respondent.     But     on  humanitarian    aspect   and
       considering the scrosanct of the marital life he suffered
       the same. He never filed a petition for nullifying their
       marriage after knowing the mental illness. He stated
       that he treated her more than 10 years. So it can be
       considered that he has condoned the alleged mental
       illness and the alleged suppression of the said fact to
       him. Their marriage was solemnised on 15/6/94. The
       present petition is filed only on 25/12/2006, only after

Mat.Appeal No.426/09
                                :   3 :



       12 years of the marriage. So PW1 is not entitled for
       contend that he was cheated by the respondents. Even
       after knowing the alleged illness, they were lived
       together about 12 years. So he is estopped at present
       from contending that 2nd respondent is mentally ill and
       her illness cannot be cured and he is cheated by the
       respondents. He is not entitled for a decree of divorce
       on this ground. This point is answered accordingly."

      5.     The appellant filed the petition seeking divorce urging

ground under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, which

reads thus;

       "(iii) has been incurably of unsound mind, or has been
       suffering continuously or intermittently from mental
       disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the
       petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the
       respondent."

      6.     Reading of the above provision shows that, a petition

can be maintained for divorce, if the spouse has been of incurably

unsound      mind,   or   has   been    suffering   continuously  or

intermittently from mental disorder of such a kind and to such an

extent that the other spouse cannot reasonably be expected to

live together. Although this was the ground urged in the petition,

reading of the above quoted portion of the impugned order shows

that the Family Court has appreciated the case of the appellant as

one filed under Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the

basis that his consent was obtained fraudulently. In our view, this

Mat.Appeal No.426/09
                               :   4 :



approach adopted by the Family Court in ignoring the ground

urged by the appellant and appreciated the case on a ground,

which was not urged by either of the parties, is illegal and for that

reason the order is untenable.

     7.    We also cannot approve the reasoning of the Family

Court that even if there was any mental disorder, the same has

been condoned by the appellant. This is for the reason that the

condonation of a ground for divorce is permissible only in terms of

Section 23(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act which only refers to

the grounds under Section 13(1)(i) and (ia) and not 13(1)(iii)

urged by the appellant.

     8.    Accordingly, setting aside the order of the Family Court

dismissing OP No.717/2006, we direct the Family Court to

reconsider the matter with notice to the parties and pass fresh

orders in accordance with law.

     Appeal is allowed as above.

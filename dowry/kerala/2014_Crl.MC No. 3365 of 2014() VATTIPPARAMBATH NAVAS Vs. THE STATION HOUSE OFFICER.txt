    ==============================
            Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014
    ==============================
       Dated this, the 13th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R




      These applications were filed by the respective accused in

S.C.No.511/09 now renumbered as S.C.No.419/14 and

S.C.No.253/09 both pending before Additional District and

Sessions Court, (Adhoc-II), Manjeri to quash the proceedings

on the basis of the settlement under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2.   The common case of both the petitioners in these

petitions is that on 08.10.2006 at about 1.30 p.m, there was

some incident happened between the petitioners in which both

of them have sustained injuries.        On the basis of the

statement     given    by   the     second     respondent    in

Crl.M.C.No.3365/14 Crime No.143/06 of Karuvarakkundu

Police Station was registered against the petitioner in that

case alleging offences under Section 341 & Section 324 of

Indian Penal Code. On the basis of the statement given by the

second respondent in Crl.M.C.No.3366/14 who is the petitioner

in Crl.M.C.No.3365/14, another crime was registered as Crime

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014  : 2 :


No.142/06 against the petitioners therein alleging offences

under Sections 341, 326 & 308 read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code.          After investigation of both the cases, Final

Reports were filed and in Crime No.143/06 after committal,

the case was originally taken on file as S.C.No.511/09 as it

was committed to that court as a counter case to be tried

along with S.C.No.253/09. After investigation and committal

in Crime No.142/06, it was taken on file as S.C.No.253/09 and

both these cases were pending before the Additional District

and Sessions Court, (Adhoc-II), Manjeri.          Since the sole

accused in S.C.No.511/09 did not appear, case against him

was transferred to register of long pending cases as

L.P.No.8/11. As directed by this court, the petitioner in that

case surrendered and now it is refiled as S.C.No.419/14. Now,

the matter has been settled between the parties. On account

of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and since

both the case and counter case have been settled between the

parties, there is no possibility of conviction as well in both the

cases. Since some of the offences are non compoundable in

nature in both the cases, court will not compound the case

even if they file an application before that court for that

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014   : 3  :


purpose. So, the petitioners have no other remedy except to

approach this court seeking the following reliefs:

              Crl.M.C.No.3365/2014

             "To quash Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 Final

      Report in Crime No:143/2006 of Karuvarakkundu Police Station

      in Malappuram District pending as S.C.No.511/2009 on the file

      of the Sessions Court, Manjeri by accepting Annexure-A3

      Affidavit of the 2nd respondent."

             Crl.M.C.No.3366/2014

             "To quash Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 Final

      Report in Crime No:142/2006 of Karuvarakkundu Police

      Station in Malappuram District pending as S.C.No.253/2009 on

      the file of the Sessions Court, Manjeri by accepting Annexure-

      A3 Affidavit of the 2nd Respondent."

       3.     The respective de facto complainants who were

shown as second respondent in both the cases appeared

through Counsel and submitted that the matter has been

settled between the parties.           On account of the settlement,

their old relationship has been restored and they do not want

to prosecute each other.            They filed separate affidavits as

Annexure III in both the petitions.

       4.     The Counsel for the petitioners in both the cases

submitted that in view of the settlement, there is no possibility

of conviction and so, they prayed for allowing the application.

       5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014  : 4 :


directed by this court, submitted that there are no other cases

against the petitioners, but opposed the application on the

ground that grave offences have been incorporated in both the

cases and it is not a fit case to invoke the power under Section

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the proceedings.

       6.     It is an admitted fact that in respect of an incident

occurred on 08.10.2006, Crime No.143/2006 & 142/2006 of

Karuvarakkundu Police Station were registered on the basis of

the statement given by the respective de facto complainants

against the petitioners respectively and after investigation,

Final Reports were filed and after committal, those cases were

originally pending before Additional District and Sessions

Court, (Adhoc-II), Manjeri as S.C.No.511/09 and 253/09

respectively.       Since the accused in S.C.No.511/09 did not

appear, the case against him was transferred to register of

long pending cases as L.P.08/11 and now as directed by this

court, he surrendered before the court below and it was refiled

as S.C.No.419/14 and he was released on bail.            Now, the

matter has been settled between the parties. Since both the

parties have settled matter between them due to the

intervention of mediators, there is no possibility of conviction

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014  :  5  :


in both the cases as they are not likely to support the case of

the prosecution. Further, on going through the allegations, it

is seen that it is a private dispute that resulted in registering

the crime and due to the intervention of well wishers of both

parties, the matter has been settled between the parties and

they do not want to prosecute each other. There is no public

interest involved in the case. It is also seen from the affidavits

filed that they are neighbours and known to each other and

belonging to the same community and on account of the

settlement, their old relationship has been restored.

       7.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.     In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014   :  6  :


      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
      for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
      the    criminal    cases   having  overwhelmingly     and   pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,   partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of
      the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the       criminal case   despite  full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is
      in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

       8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a case and

counter case which resulted on account of a private dispute

between the parties and later it was settled between them and

there is no possibility of conviction on account of the

settlement and proceeding with the case will only amount to

wastage of judicial time, this court feels that it is a fit case

where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Crl.M.C.Nos.3365 & 3366 of 2014  : 7 :


Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings as against

the petitioners in both cases in order to promote the harmony

that has been restored in between them and the pendency of

these cases should not be a hurdle for the same.

       So, the applications are allowed and further proceedings

in S.C.No.419/14 (Crime No.143/06 of Karuvarakkundu Police

Station) as against the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.3365/14 and

further proceedings in S.C.No.253/09 (Crime No.142/06 of

Karuvarakkundu Police Station) as against the petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.3366/14, both pending before Additional District

and Sessions Court, (Adhoc-II), Manjeri are quashed.

       Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

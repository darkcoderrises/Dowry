                        B.A.No. 3823 of 2015
                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                 Dated this the 6th day of July, 2015

                                O R D E R



     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners are said to have committed the offence

under Section 498A IPC.           The prosecution case is that they

subjected the first petitioner's wife to cruelty.

     3.    Heard.

     4.    The first petitioner and the first informant have been

married only for four months. The allegation is that demanding

more dowry, the first petitioner and his co-accused subjected her

to cruelty. It appears that restoration of peace in family is not

impossible. There is no allegation that the victim sustained any

serious injuries. In these circumstances, I am inclined to grant the

prayer of the petitioners.

           In the result, this application is allowed.

    1)The petitioners shall be released on bail on their executing

      a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand

      only) each with two solvent sureties each for the like sum

      if they are arrested by the Police in connection with this

                                    ::2::

        case.

     2)They shall appear before the Investigating Officer for

        interrogation if they are so required by him in writing.

     3)They shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

     4)They shall not harass the de facto complainant or her

        relatives, nor shall they contact or communicate with her

        or enter her residential premises.

         If the petitioners surrender before the Magistrate this order is

  not applicable and the learned Magistrate may pass appropriate

  orders.

          In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the

  learned Magistrate is empowered to cancel the bail in

  accordance with the law.

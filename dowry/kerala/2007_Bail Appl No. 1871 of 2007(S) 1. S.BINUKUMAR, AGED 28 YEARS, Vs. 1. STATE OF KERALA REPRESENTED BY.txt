                              B.A. No. 1871 OF 2007

                    Dated this the 28th day of March, 2007


                                      O R D E R




               Petitioner,   who   at   present   is   the   sole   accused   in   Crime


No.74/2007 of Paravoor Police Station for an offence punishable under


section 498A IPC, seeks anticipatory bail.


       2.      The   petitioner   was   a   driver   in   the   house   of   the   defacto


complainant.     An   intimacy   between   them   had   developed   which


eventually led to their elopement. They got married on 13.2.2006.   But


soon after the marriage, the petitioner began to mentally and physically


torture   the   defacto   complainant   demanding   dowry.     The   defacto


complainant had left the company of the petitioner and was residing in


her   parental   home.     On   8.8.2006   while   she   was   travelling   in   an


autorikshaw   along   with   her   aunt,   the   petitioner   is   alleged   to   have


reached   there   in   a   Qualis   car   along   with   accused   Nos.5   and   6   and


attempted to abduct and kill her by giving poison.


       3.      Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of this nature.


But at the same time, I am inclined to permit the petitioner to surrender


before   the   Investigating   Officer   for   interrogation   and   then   to   have   his


application   for   regular   bail   considered   by   the   Magistrate   concerned.


BA.1871/07

                                     : 2 :




Accordingly,   the   petitioner   is   directed   to   surrender   before   the


Investigating Officer on any day between 2.4.2007 and 4.4.2007 for the


purpose of interrogation.    The  petitioner  shall, thereafter, be produced


on the same day before the concerned Magistrate, who shall release the


petitioner on bail on appropriate conditions.





       This application is disposed of as above.

                Dated this the 9th day of April, 2010

                            O R D E R

       This is an application for bail under Section 439 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is accused No.1 in

Crime No.201/2010 of Palakkad Town North Police Station.

       2. The offence alleged against the petitioner is under

Section 304-B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

       3. The prosecution case is that on 10/3/2010, the wife of

the petitioner committed suicide on account of the harassment

meted out by the petitioner and his mother, the second accused,

demanding more dowry.

       4. The petitioner was arrested on 12/3/2010 and he was

remanded to judicial custody. Though the petitioner moved an

application for bail before the court of Session, Palakkad, that

application was dismissed by the order dated 26/3/2010. The

investigation has progressed thereafter.

       5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

the petitioner is prepared to comply with any condition that may

be imposed by the Court for granting bail to him. He also

                                   2

submitted that the petitioner would co-operate with the

Investigating Agency to its full extent. These submissions are

recorded.

        6. Taking into account the facts and circumstances of the

case, the duration of the judicial custody undergone by the

petitioner, the nature of the offence and also the submissions

made by the learned counsel for the petitioner, I am of the view

that bail can be granted to the petitioner.

        7. The petitioner shall be released on bail on his executing

bond for Rs.25,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like

amount to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate of the First

Class-II, Palakkad subject to the following conditions:-

               A)  The petitioner shall report before the
                   Investigating Officer between 9 A.M. and
                   11 A.M. on all Mondays and Thursdays for
                   a period of one month and thereafter on
                   Mondays, till the final report is filed or
                   until further orders.

               B)  The petitioner shall    appear before the
                   Investigating Officer for interrogation as
                   and when required.

               C) The petitioner shall not try to influence the
                   prosecution witnesses or tamper with the
                   evidence.

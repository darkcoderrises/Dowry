                =======================
              Crl.M.C. No. 6235 of 2014
           =================================
      Dated this the 19th day of November, 2014


                        ORDER

     The   accused   in   Crime    No.890    of  2013   of

Thalayolaparambu Police Station, presently pending as

CC No.87 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, Vaikom, are the petitioners herein.     They have

come up under Section 482 Cr.P.C for getting Annexure I

final  report    in   Crime      No.890    of   2013    of

Thalayolaparambu Police Station and all proceedings in

CC No.87 of 2014 based on it pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court, Vaikom, quashed.      The

proceedings are relating to the offences punishable under

Sections 498A and 406 r/w 34 IPC and Sections 3, 4 and 6

of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.

     2.  The allegation against the petitioners is that

they have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant,

who is the wife of the 1st petitioner and treated her with

                                -2-
Crl.M.C. No. 6235 of 2014


cruelty        by       demanding    more    dowry,   after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      3.     According to the petitioners, presently the

matter has been settled between the parties and there

are no subsisting disputes between them. The defacto

complainant, who is the 1st respondent herein, has filed

an affidavit stating that the matter has been amicably

settled between the parties and the parties have moved a

joint petition for divorce under Section 10A of the Divorce

Act, 1869 as OP No.484 of 2014 before the Family Court,

Kottayam at Ettumanoor.            According to the defacto

complainant, she does not want to proceed with the

matter further and she also prays for getting the

proceedings quashed.

      4.     The 1st respondent entered appearance through

her counsel. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent

has endorsed the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the defacto complainant on her own volition. When all

                                -3-
Crl.M.C. No. 6235 of 2014


the disputes have been settled between the parties, being

a matrimonial dispute, this Court is of the view that there

is no meaning in proceeding with the matter further.

      5.     In the result, this Crl.M.C    is allowed, and

Annexure I final report in Crime No.890 of 2013 of

Thalayolaparambu          Police  Station, and  all further

proceedings in CC No.87 of 2014 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Vaikom shall stand quashed.

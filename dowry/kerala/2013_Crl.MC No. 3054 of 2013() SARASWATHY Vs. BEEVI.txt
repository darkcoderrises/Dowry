                 Crl.M.C.No.3054 of 2013
                --------------------------------------
            Dated this the 24th day of July, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime No.710 of

2013 of Konny Police Station, Pathanamthitta District for the

offence punishable under Section 379 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure-I charge in Crime No.710 of 2013 of Konny

Police Station, Pathanamthitta District as the matter is settled

out of court.

     2. The allegation in the above case is that while the de

facto complainant standing in front of the tea shop of Assee at

Konni junction at 1 p.m. on 02/07/2013 the petitioner had

committed theft of gold chain weighing 2 sovereigns and

thereby the accused has committed the offence punishable

under Section 379 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that, the matter is settled between herself and the de facto

complainant. The de facto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein sworn into an Annexure-II affidavit.

Crl.M.C.No.3054 of 2013
                               :-2-:

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and she has no grievance against her.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-II affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

Crl.M.C.No.3054 of 2013
                                     :-3-:

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offence involved in

the above case is only under Section 379 of IPC which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

Crl.M.C.No.3054 of 2013
                                        :-4-:

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

Crl.M.C.No.3054 of 2013
                               :-5-:

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I charge in Crime No.710 of 2013 of Konny Police

Station, Pathanamthitta District and all further proceedings

thereto.

                 Dated this the 19th day of March 2015

                                     ORDER


      Petitioner, who is the accused in Crime No.116/2012

Rajapuram Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code,

has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for

getting Annexure-AII final report in above crime and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.318/2015 now pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, quashed.

      2.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is his wife, and

treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC,

by demanding more dowry.

Crl.M.C.1200 /2015               2

      3.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      5.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably settled

and, therefore, she has no complaints against the petitioner, and,

hence, all further proceedings in the matter referred to above can

be quashed. She has entered appearance through her counsel. The

learned counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on

Crl.M.C.1200 /2015                  3

her own volition.

      6.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in the

interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-AII final

report in crime No.116/2012 of Rajapuram police station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.318/2015 now pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, are

quashed.

                CRL.M.C. No.6777 of 2014
               =====================
            Dated this the 10th day of March, 2014

                         O R D E R


     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1482 of 2012 of

the Pathanamthitta Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report in

Crime No.1482 of 2012 of the Pathanamthitta Police Station

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.37 of 2013

presently pending as L.P.No.8 of 2014 on the file of the

Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Pathanamthitta, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

CRL.M.C.No.6777 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

entered appearance through her counsel. The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

CRL.M.C.No.6777 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A

Final    Report     in Crime   No.1482     of  2012   of  the

Pathanamthitta Police Station as against the petitioner and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.37 of 2013, which

is presently pending as L.P.No.8 of 2014 on the file of the

Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Pathanamthitta, are

hereby quashed.

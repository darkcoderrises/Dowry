                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - -
              Dated this the 1st day of December, 2014

                                    ORDER

      Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioners are accused Nos.2 and 3 in Crime

No.839/2014 of Palakkad Town North Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 306, 498(A) and 354A(ii)

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    Deceased Soumya, aged 25, was given in marriage to

the first accused. Thereafter, at the matrimonial house, she was

harassed and tortured to the maximum, by demanding more dowry

and gold ornaments. Her life was so miserable, that she had no

other go than to commit suicide. In the meanwhile, it is alleged

that sexual overtures were repeatedly made towards her, by the first

petitioner herein, who is none other than her father-in-law. She has

complained about such sexual harassments from the part of her

B.A.8385 of 2014                    2

father-in-law, to the 1st accused. There was nobody to rescue her.

Second petitioner is the sister of the first accused and the daughter

of the first petitioner. Finally, the girl could not withstand with the

harassment and tortures, and has committed suicide by hanging at

her house on 11.7.2014.

      4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor. The contents of the C.D. Prima facie

reveal the complicity of the first petitioner, who is the second

accused and also that of the first accused. At the same time, it

seems that the allegations against the second petitioner, who is the

third accused, are only very limited. The only allegation was that

she was also instrumental in demanding more dowry. At the same

time, there is nothing to show that, that was the reason why the girl

had opted to commit suicide. For the continued investigation of

the case, I do not think that the custodial interrogation of the

second petitioner is required. Considering the facts that the second

B.A.8385 of 2014                   3

petitioner is a woman, the role attributed to her is very limited and

the present stage of investigation, I am of the view that this is a fit

case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the second

petitioner. At the same time, custodial interrogation of the first

petitioner is required for the continued investigation of the case

and therefore, he is not entitled to the discretionary relief of

anticipatory bail.

      5.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the second petitioner, is directed to enlarge the second

petitioner on bail in the event of her arrest on her executing a bond

for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent

sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and        subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

             (i)  The second petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

B.A.8385 of 2014                    4

      all Thursdays and Mondays, commencing from

      4.12.2014 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

             (ii) The second petitioner shall not tamper with

      the evidence or influence witnesses.

             (iii) The second petitioner shall make himself

      available for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

             (iv) The second petitioner shall not involve in

      any offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

      As far as the first petitioner is concerned, this Bail

Application stands dismissed.

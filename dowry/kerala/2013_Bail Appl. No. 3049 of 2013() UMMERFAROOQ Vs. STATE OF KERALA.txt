                    B.A. No. 3049 of 2013
        -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                         O R D E R



     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.57 of 2013

of Badiadka Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 324 and 506(ii) of

the Indian Penal Code.

     3.   The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant who is

his wife by demanding more dowry.

     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the C.D. Apart from

B.A. No. 3049/13
                              -:2:-

the usual allegations in a case relating to an offence under

Section 498A IPC, any special instances of harassment are

not specifically pointed out against the petitioner. Learned

counsel for the petitioner submits that the parties have

been residing separately. Considering the facts and

circumstances of this case and the present stage of

investigation, I do not think that the custodial interrogation

of the petitioner is required for the continued investigation

of this case. Matters being so, this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

     5.   In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and

the Investigating Officer or such other police officer who

is conducting the arrest of the petitioner is directed to

enlarge the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

B.A. No. 3049/13
                             -:3:-

his executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees Twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum

each to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

     (1)  The    petitioner    shall  report   before     the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

Wednesdays and Saturdays commencing from 3-7-2013 for a

period of three months or till the filing of the final report,

which ever is earlier.

     (2) The petitioner shall not tamper with the evidence

or influence witnesses.

     (3) The petitioner shall make himself available for

interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

Officer.

B.A. No. 3049/13
                             -:4:-

     (4) The petitioner shall not involve in any offence while

on bail.

     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

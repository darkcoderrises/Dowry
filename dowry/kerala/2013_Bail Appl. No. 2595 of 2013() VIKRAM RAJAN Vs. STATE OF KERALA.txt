                    B.A. No. 2595 of 2013
                -----------------------------------
           Dated this the 18th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. According to the petitioners, they are

apprehending      arrest     in    connection      with   Crime

No.689/2013 of the Mathilagam Police Station, registered

for the offences punishable under Sections          498(A), 447,

427 and 506 (1) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2. The learned Public Prosecutor has reported that

petitioners 2 to 4 are not arraigned as accused in the

crime.    Matters being so, this petition, as far as

petitioners 2 to 4 are concerned, is not maintainable and

hence dismissed.

     3. The allegation against the first petitioner is that

he has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant,

who is his wife, by demanding more dowry.

     4. Heard the learned counsel for the first petitioner,

learned counsel for the defacto complainant and the

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD.           It has

B.A. No. 2595 of 2013
                                2

come out that matters are pending before the Family

Court, Thrissur in between the parties for divorce. Those

proceedings were initiated one year back. On going

through the facts of the case and the present stage of

investigation,      I do  not   think    that  the  custodial

interrogation of the first petitioner is required for the

continued investigation of this case. Matters being so,

anticipatory bail can be granted to the first petitioner.

       5. In the result, this B.A. is allowed in part and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the first petitioner is directed to

enlarge the first petitioner on bail in the event of his

arrest on his executing a bond for `.25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties for

the like sum each to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and      subject to the following terms

and conditions.

      (1) The first petitioner shall report before the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

Tuesdays and Fridays, commencing from 25.06.2013 for a

B.A. No. 2595 of 2013
                                 3

period of three months or till the filing of the final report in

this case, which ever is earlier.

      (2) The first petitioner shall not tamper with the

evidence or influence witnesses.

      (3) The first petitioner shall make himself available

for   interrogation    as   and      when  required    by   the

Investigating Officer.

      (4) The first petitioner shall not involve in any offence

while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

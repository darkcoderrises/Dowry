                     K. RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                   .................................................
                Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014
                   ..................................................
               Dated this the 1st day of April, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      Crl.M.C.No.1822/2014 was filed by accused 1 and 3 in

C.C.No.66/2010     pending          before        the      Judicial   First Class

Magistrate Court-I, North Paravur, while Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014

was filed by accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.690/2010 pending

before the same court for quashing the proceedings in view of

the settlement    arrived at between the parties under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in both the petitions that there was an

incident occurred in which both the petitioners sustained

injuries. On the basis of a statement given by the 2nd respondent

in Crl.M.C.No.1822/2014, who was the second petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014, Crime No.17/2007 of Puthenvelikkara

police station was registered against the petitioners and

another person in that case alleging commission of the offences

under Sections 324, 326 read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code and after investigation, final report was filed and it

was taken on file as            C.C.No.66/2010 against the present

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014      2

petitioners and one Chakkappan as the second accused. The

said Chakkappan died and charge against him was abated.

In respect of the same incident, another crime was registered

as    Crime No.18/2007 by the           same    police  against  the

petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014 alleging commission of the

offences under Sections 324, 326 and 34 of the Indian Penal

Code and       this     case was    registered on the basis   of the

statement       given by       the deceased  Chakkappan and     after

investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.690/2010 and both the cases are pending before the

Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, North Paravur. It is also

an admitted fact that the petitioners in both the cases are

relatives. Jose and Chakkappan, who are the respective defacto

complainants in both the cases are brothers and accused in

C.C.No.66/2010,             who     are     the     petitioners    in

Crl.M.C.No.1822/2014, are the wife and son of Chakkappan

and accused in C.C.No.690/2010, who are the petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014 are said Jose, his wife and son.

      3. Now the matter has been settled between the parties

and family relationship has been restored as well on account

of the settlement due to intervention of mediators. Both the

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014        3

parties do not want to prosecute the respective prosecutions

against accused persons. Since some of the offences are non

compoundable in nature, they could not file application before

the court below for compounding. So they have no other option

except to approach this Court seeking the following reliefs:



            Crl.M.C.No.1822/2014:

            For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of

            hearing, it is humbly prayed that the Honourable Court

            may be pleased to    allow the Criminal Miscellaneous

            Case and quash ANNEXURE-A1, charge sheet and the

            entire proceedings in C.C.No.66 of 2010 of the Court

            of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, North

            Paravur in Ernakulam District, so as to secure the ends

            of justice.

            Cr.M.C.No.1823/2014:

            Hence it is humbly prayed that the Honourable Court

            may be pleased to allow the Criminal Miscellaneous

            Cae and quash the ANNEXURE-A, charge sheet and

            the entire proceedings in C.C.No.690 of 2010 of the

            Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I,

            North Paravur in Ernakulam District, so as to secure

            the ends of justice.

      4. The injured in both the cases appeared though counsel

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014       4

and submitted that they are relatives and the matter has been

settled between the parties and one of accused namely

Chakkappan, who is the brother of the second petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014, died and after his death, due to the

intervention of mediators and family members the matter has

been settled and the family relationship has been restored on

account of the settlement.          So they do not want to prosecute

each other.      The petitioners in both the cases also submitted

that in view        of the settlement    there is possibility of any

conviction arises.

      5. The learned           Public  Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court in both the cases, submitted that except

this case, there is no other case against the petitioners and and

they are relatives, but opposed the application considering the

fact that the offence under Section 326 is involved in both the

cases.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by Chakkappan, who is the brother of Jose, who is the

second respondent in Crl.M.C.No.1822/2014 and the second

petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014, Crime No.18/2007 of

Puthenvelikkara police station has been registered against the

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014       5

petitioners      in Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014 and after investigation,

final   report      was     filed  and  it  was  taken  on    file as

C.C.No.690/2010 and pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, North Paravur.          In respect of the    same

incident, on the basis of the statement given by the           second

respondent in Crl.M.C.No.1822/2013 and the second petitioner

in Crl.M.C.No.1823/2014 another crime was              registered as

Crime No.17/2007 by the same police against the petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No1822/2014 and            deceased   Chakkappan and     after

investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.66/2010 and both the cases are pending before the same

court.    The fact that         the accused in both the   cases   are

relatives and one of the defacto complainants is no more now.

It is also alleged in the affidavits filed by the respective defacto

complainant and the injured person that the matter has been

settled between the parties and the family relationship has

been restored due to intervention of mediators and they do not

want to prosecute each other.          It is an admitted fact that in

view of the settlement, two families of brothers have joined

together and pendency of the           cases should not be a hurdle

for    their    relationship.     Further,  it was   due   to    some

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014         6

misunderstanding between the two brothers that the incident

happened, which resulted in registering two crimes and filing

final report as well. Now they have settled the issue and

residing together happily. In view of the settlement in both the

cases, the injured persons are not going to support the case of

the prosecution and conviction in both the cases is remote as it

is a case and counter case and both the parties have settled

their disputes due to intervention of mediators.

        7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

             pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

             footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

             offences      arising  from    commercial,     financial

             mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions

             or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to

             dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong is

             basically private or personal in nature and the parties

             have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of

             cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if

             in its view, because of the compromise between the

             offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014         7

             remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

             would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

             and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

             quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

             settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

             words, the High Court must consider whether it

             would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice

             to continue with the criminal proceedings or

             continuation of the criminal proceedings would

             tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

             settlement and compromise between the victim and

             wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,

             it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end

             and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the              above decision

and also considering the fact that parties to the litigation in

both the cases         are    relatives   and     due to    intervention of

mediators and family members, the dispute has been resolved

and harmony has been restored in the family of two brothers

and     one of the brothers is no more now and possibility of

Crl.M.C.Nos.1822 & 1823 of 2014          8

conviction is remote, this Court feels that it is a fit case where

the power under             Section 482 of the           Code of   Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings in order

to promote settlement and restoration of harmony that has

been brought in the family of two brothers and pendency of

both the cases would not be hurdle                  for the same. So the

petitions      are      allowed      and     further      proceedings    in

C.C.No.66/2010 (Crime No.17/2007 of Puthenvelikkara police

station) and C.C.No.690/2010 (Crime No.18/2007 of the same

police station) pending before the                   Judicial First   Class

Magistrate Court-I, North Paravur as against the petitioners in

both the cases are hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to          communicate this order        to  the

concerned court for further action in this matter.

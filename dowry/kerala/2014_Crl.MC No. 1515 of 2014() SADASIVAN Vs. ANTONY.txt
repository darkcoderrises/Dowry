    ==============================
                Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 11th day of March, 2014.


                          O R D E R


     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

Crime No.119/14 of Palakkad Town South Police Station, to

quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at

between the parties under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.119/14 of

Palakkad Town South Police Station registered on the basis of

the statement given by first respondent alleging offences under

Sections. 417, 420, 423, read with Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code. The allegation was that, in the year 1990, the accused

had executed a document No.365 of 1990 of Sub Registrar

Office, Palakkad, in favour of the de facto complainant's

daughter after accepting consideration for the same.       The

accused contrary to the agreement with an intention to cheat

the de facto complainant and his daughter executed the

document comprised in Survey No.44/1C of Puduserry West

Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014         : 2    :

Village instead of Survey No. 44/4C of the same village which

is having only 1 cents of land against the agreement for 8

cents of property and thereby cheated the de facto

complainant and his daughter. The case was registered on the

basis of some misunderstanding regarding the survey number

mentioned in the property and after negotiation between

parties, the same has been settled with the de facto

complainant and his daughter.              Now, there is no dispute

between the parties in respect of the property assigned. The

de facto complainant and his daughter have filed affidavits

regarding the settlement and their willingness to quash the

proceedings against the petitioners. No purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case as well on account of the

settlement. Since it is in the crime stage, neither the police

nor the court will accept the settlement and drop further

proceedings.        So, they have no other option except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

            "To allow this criminal miscellaneous case and to quash

      Annexure A F.I.R and all further proceedings pursuant thereto

      in Crime No.119/2014 of Palakkad Town South Police Station,

      Palakkad as against the petitioners/Accused Nos.1 and 2 in

      order to secure the ends of justice."

Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014     : 3   :

      3.     Respondents 1 and 2 appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and the case itself was filed on the basis of some

misunderstanding regarding the survey number mentioned in

the document which has been clarified now. So, they don't

want to proceed with the case. They also filed affidavits to

that effect before this court as Annexure B and C. The Counsel

for the petitioners submitted that since it is a property dispute

and it has been settled between the parties, no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,

submitted that there is no other case except the present case

between the parties but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on account of some

property dispute which was assigned by the accused persons in

favour of the daughter of the de facto complainant who is the

second respondent herein, in the year 1990, on the basis of

the statement given by the first respondent, Annexure A crime

was registered by Palakkad Town South police against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections. 417, 420, 423,

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. It is also seen from

Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014          : 4     :

the averments in the petition that the matter has been now

settled between the de facto complainant and his daughter and

the petitioners and respondents 1 and 2 have filed Annexure B

and C affidavits stating that the matter has been settled

between the parties and there is no grievance now subsisting

between them and they have no objection in quashing the

proceedings. It is clear from the averments that the entire

dispute arose on account of some misunderstanding regarding

the survey number of the property which has been now

clarified and settled between the parties.

       6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
      the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014            : 5   :

      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
      for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
      the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions
      or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc;
      or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
      dispute.   In this category of case, High Court may quash
      criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
      remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
      accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
      case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
      the victim.    In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
      to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
      criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the victim
      and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
      well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



       7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision, and also considering the fact that it is a matter of

civil dispute which has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of mediators and friends and no purpose will

be served by allowing the investigation to continue as neither

the de facto complainant nor his daughter who was the

beneficiary under the document are likely to support the

investigation and there is remote possibility of conviction even

if final report is filed in this case, this court feels that it is a fit

Crl.M.C.No.1515 of 2014      : 6  :

case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.119/14 of Palakkad Town South Police Station as

against the petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to

communicate this order to the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Palakkad, so as to inform the concerned police station about

this order for their further necessary action in this regard.

                  Crl.M.C. NO. 881 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of September, 2012

                           ORDER


            Petitioner is the accused in a pending case,

numbered as C.C.No.1172 of 2011, on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur. He is being prosecuted for

offences punishable under Sections 403, 406, 498(A) and

506(ii) of Indian Penal Code, on a report filed by the Sub

Inspector of Police, Town West Police Station, Thrissur. The

crime in the aforesaid case was registered on the complaint

given by his wife imputing of matrimonial cruelty and

harassment demanding dowry. After investigation report was

filed indicting him of the offences as stated supra, and the

case numbered as above stated is now pending before the

magistrate.     Petitioner has filed the above petition for

quashing the criminal proceedings against him in the case

contending that such proceedings are an abuse of process of

the court. Allegations imputed against him by his wife are

Crl.M.C. NO. 881 of 2012           2



false and totally unworthy of any merit, is his case relying

upon some documents produced and also circumstances

relating to previous proceedings between the spouses.

Whatever defences available to the petitioner to resist the

prosecution, no doubt, can be canvassed before the

magistrate. In case, he has got any sustainable ground to

seek for discharge on the premise that the charges imputed

against him are groundless, it is open to the petitioner to

canvass the same as envisaged under Section 239 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. After looking into the materials

produced and also considering the submissions made, I find

this is not a fit case for invoking the inherent powers of this

court as canvassed for.

             Petition is dismissed.

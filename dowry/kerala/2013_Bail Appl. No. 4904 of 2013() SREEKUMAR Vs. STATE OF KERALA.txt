                     P.BHAVADASAN, J.
              ---------------------------------------
             Bail Application No.4904 OF 2013
              ---------------------------------------
           Dated this the 2nd day of August, 2013.


                            O R D E R


     The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.1094/2013 of

Punalur Police Station who is alleged to have committed the

offence punishable under Section 304B of Indian Penal Code.

The marriage between the petitioner and the victim was

solemnized on 08.11.2009 and they have a child in the wedlock.

The allegation against the petitioner is that he had pledged the

gold ornaments which the lady had brought at the time of

marriage and in spite of her repeated requests, he did not

redeem the gold ornaments which led the lady to commit suicide.

     2. The petitioner would point out that he is innocent and

has been falsely implicated in the matter. It is contended that at

any rate offence under Section 304B IPC can never be attracted

because there is no complaint that the lady was harassed

demanding more dowry. It is also pointed out that the child is

being looked after by the petitioner and under that circumstance,

he seeks pre-arrest bail.

B.A.No.4904/2013                    2


       3.     Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition and

pointed out that the investigation is going on.

       4.    The petitioner has produced a copy of the complaint

which led to registration of the crime. It seems to have been

filed by the brother of the victim.          On going through the

complaint, the only grievance appears to be that in spite of

repeated demands and requests by the victim, the petitioner did

not redeem the gold ornaments pledged by him. True, the death

is within seven years of marriage. But that by itself may not be a

ground to attract the offence under Section 304B IPC. There has

to be some materials to show prima facie that there was demand

for dowry. A probe into the veracity of the allegations is not

warranted at this point of time.

       Considering the nature of the allegations against the

petitioner and also the facts of the case, it is felt that this is a fit

case where extra ordinary jurisdiction of this Court needs to be

exercised in favour of the petitioner. Therefore, the application is

allowed on the following conditions:

       i)     The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

              Officer  on   or   before   08.08.2013     who,     after

B.A.No.4904/2013                      3


              interrogation, shall produce him before the Court

              concerned, which court, on application for bail being

              moved by the petitioner, shall release him on bail on

              his executing bond for a sum of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees

              Fifteen Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for

              the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Court

              concerned.

       ii)    The Court concerned shall ensure the identity of the

              sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts

              produced by them.

       iii)   The petitioner shall report before the Investigating

              Officer on every Wednesday between 9 a.m and

              10 a.m until further orders.

       iv)    The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper

              with the evidence or influence or try to influence the

              witness.

       v)     If any of the condition is violated, the bail granted

              shall stand cancelled and the Court concerned, on

              being satisfied of the said fact, may take such steps as

              are available to it in law.

                                                Sd/-

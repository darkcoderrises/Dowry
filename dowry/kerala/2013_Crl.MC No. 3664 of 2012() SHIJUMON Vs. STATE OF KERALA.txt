                     Crl.M.C. No.3664 of 2012
                  ---------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 26th day of February, 2013


                                  ORDER


            This is an application filed by the accused in Crime

No.259/2012 of Chittarickal Police Station, Kasargod District, to

quash First Information Report under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused persons in Crime No.259/2012 of Chittarickal Police

Station, which was registered alleging commission of offence

under Sections 498A, 354, 323 and 506(i) read with 34 of Indian

Penal Code.     The incident alleged arises out of matrimonial

relationship between the defacto complainant wife (second

respondent herein) and the first accused/husband, (the first

petitioner herein). Petitioners/Accused 2 and 3 are the parents,

and petitioner No.4 is the sister, of first accused. The defacto

complainant wife entered into matrimony with the first accused

person on 19.12.2011. According to the wife, she had been

staying in the matrimonial home after the marriage, and while

staying together, husband left for Muscat. The accused 2 to 4

started ill treating the defacto complainant on one or other

Crl.M.C. 3664/2012-C            :2:


reasons, and complaining that the gold ornaments worth Rs.4

lakhs and amount of Rs.1 lakh given by the wife at the time of

marriage was being insufficient, she was subjected to

harassment. The husband, although was informed of the

cruelty, did not react but he was in support of his parents and

sister. There was an instance where defacto complainant and

her mother were assaulted.      Due to the intervention of the

relatives and well wishers, entire disputes arising in the

matrimony of the couple have been settled amicably and they

started staying together under the same roof. Now the

petitioners pray for quashing the proceedings on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg.

      3.     The second respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that they are now living together and there is no

dispute between them and she has no objection in allowing the

application. She has also filed an affidavit attested by a notary

public stating above facts.

      4.     Heard   the  counsel    for    petitioners,  second

respondent and Public Prosecutor.

      5.     The above case was registered on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent herein against the

petitioners alleging offence under Sections 498A, 354, 323 and

Crl.M.C. 3664/2012-C             :3:


506(i) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.             The

investigation is over and final report filed and case has been

taken on file as CC.1251/2012 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg. In the meantime, the defacto

complainant, who is none other than the wife of the first

accused, settled the matter with the accused persons including

her husband, first accused and they have decided to live

together and she filed an affidavit before this Court stating that

they are living together and she had no objection in quashing

the proceedings and if the proceedings is allowed to continue,

that will affect their matrimonial life.     Since some of the

offences are non compoundable in nature, they are not able to

move the lower court. Hence this application has been filed to

quash the proceedings.

      6.     Both the counsel for the petitioners and the second

respondent submitted that they are living together and the

dispute between them has been settled and they are leading a

happy life.

      7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh Vs. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] it has been held that,

          "It is within the powers of a High Court to quash

          criminal proceedings, involving non compoundable

Crl.M.C. 3664/2012-C              :4:


          offences, on the basis of compromise reached

          between      the   offender    and     the   victim.

          Compounding of offences under Section 320 of

          Cr.P.C. and quashing of       criminal proceedings

          under Section 482 of the Code are different and

          distinct.   High Court must consider whether it

          would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

          justice to continue with such proceedings in view of

          the settlement and compromise reached."

In the same decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

considered the nature of cases, which could be quashed, when

the matter has been settled between the parties, as follows:

          "But where offences involved are grave and

          heinous in nature like murder, rape, dacoity and

          also cases involving the offences under special

          statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

          offences committed by public servants while

          working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for

          any basis for quashing criminal proceedings

          involving such offences.    But the criminal cases

          having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the purposes

          of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial,      financial,    mercantile,     civil,

          partnership or such like transactions or the

          offences arising out of matrimony relating to

          dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the

Crl.M.C. 3664/2012-C                :5:


          wrong is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire dispute.

          In this category of cases, High Court may quash

          criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

          compromise between the offender and the victim,

          the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim.   In other words, the High Court must

          consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to

          the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

          proceedings or continuation of the criminal

          proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process

          of law despite settlement and compromise between

          the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure

          the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

          case is put to an end and if the answer to the above

          question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

          be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

          proceeding."

      8.      In this case, it is seen from the submission made by

the learned Public Prosecutor that the investigation is over and

final report has been filed.        However, since it is a matter

involving matrimonial dispute and both the husband and wife

Crl.M.C. 3664/2012-C             :6:


have resolved their dispute and decided to live together, it is

the duty of this Court to promote family union than allowing

them to fight in court. So, considering the circumstances there

is no purpose in continuing the proceedings and it is in the

interest of justice and also to promote the reunion between the

spouses, this Court has to invoke the power under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings. So,

the case registered against the petitioners on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent and registered as

Crime No.259/2012 of Chittarickal Police Station, Kasargod

District and further proceedings pending, as C.C.1251/2012,

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg

are hereby quashed. The above application is allowed and the

entire proceedings initiated on the basis of Crime No.259/2012

of Chittarickal Police Station of Kasargod District is quashed.

The office is directed to communicate the order to the

concerned court immediately.

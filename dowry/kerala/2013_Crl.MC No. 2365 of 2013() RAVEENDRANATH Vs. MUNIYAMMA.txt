                  Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                           ORDER


         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in C.C.No.104/2006 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 98/2001 of

Vellathooval Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 205, 406, 409, 463, 468, 471, 474, 477 A, r/w 34 of

I.P.C., with a prayer to set aside the Annexure A4, the

conviction and sentence passed by the judicial first class

Magistrate, Adimaly in C.C.No.104 of 2006 and all other

proceedings in Crl.A.No.22 of 2013 pending before the Addl.

District (Adhoc) Court-I, Thodupuzha may be quahed as the

matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that A1 was

the president of the Vellathooval Service Co-operative Bank

Ltd. No.71. While being so, on 4/12/1995 A1 forged the

signatures of Muniyammal who is the defacto complainant.

Purushothaman and Balasubramannian are the guarantors in

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                2

the loan application. The guarantors also submitted separate

loan application in their names also. In all three loan

applications these three persons were receited as mutual

guarantors, for which also A1 forged their signatures and

thumb impression with an intension of causing it to be believed

that those original loan applications made by the applicants.

On the same day A1 forged the signature of the secretary of

the society in the voucher and received Rs.30,000/- in the

name of the above three persons resulting in misappropriation

of the amounts of the bank. A2 who was supposed to verify

the loan applications knowing that those are forged onces

certified the same as genuine. A3 knowing the same to be

forged loan applications passed the same and now, the case of

the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.             Therefore, the

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                3

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and sh has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 205, 406, 409, 463, 468,

471, 474, 477 A, r/w 34 which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                  4

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the first respondent, it appears to me that the the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from

         the above discussion can be summarised

         thus:      the power of the High Court in

         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

         power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of

         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

         has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                  5

         abuse of the process of any Court. In what

         cases      power    to  quash   the   criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

         exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on

         the facts and circumstances of each case

         and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes     of  quashing,  particularly the

          offences      arising    from   commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                  6

          its  view,    because   of   the compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite    full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

Crl.M.C.NO.2365 of 2013
                                7

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -4 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioner in C.C.No. 104 of 2006 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, and all further proceedings thereto.

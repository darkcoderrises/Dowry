                  ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
           =========================
                  Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014
        ============================
          Dated this the 23rd day of October, 2014

                           ORDER



      The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.496 of

2007 of Pandalam Police Station registered for offences alleged

under Sections 323, 324 and 326 r/w Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.      The police after investigation submitted the

impugned    Annexure    A   final report/charge  sheet   in  the

aforementioned crime which has now led to the pendency of the

Sessions Case No.545 of 2012 on the file of the Sessions Court,

Pathanamthitta.

      2. The prosecution allegation as made out in the impugned

Annexure A final report/charge sheet is that on 18.08.2007 at

about   10   a.m  at   Nediyakala   in Mezhuveli    Village, the

petitioners/accused persons had jointly attacked the contesting

respondents 1 and 2 (de facto complainants (CW1 and CW2)) due

to the prior animosity towards them in connection with a family

dispute and thereby the contesting respondents 1 and 2

(CW1 & 2) sustained injuries and that the accused have thus

committed the aforementioned offences. After the submission of

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014           2



the impugned Annexure A final report/charge sheet in the above

said crime, the case was committed to the Sessions Court,

Pathanamthitta and the case is pending before that court as S.C

No.545 of 2012.        It is stated that now consequent to the

intervention of well wishers the entire dispute between the

petitioners and the de facto complainant/injured/respondents

1 and 2 have been settled. Annexures B and C are the respective

affidavits sworn to by the contesting respondents 1 and 2 on

30.08.2014 stating the above aspects wherein it is further stated

that the subject matter in relation to the above said crime has

been settled by the parties entering into a compromise and that

the said respondents are not interested to proceed any further

with the impugned criminal proceedings and that they have no

objection in quashing the impugned final report/charge sheet in

the aforementioned crime which has led to the pendency of S.C

No545 of 2012 on the file of the Sessions Court, Pathanamthitta

and that in case the aforementioned impugned criminal

proceedings are quashed by this Court, they will not raise any

objection against that in future etc. It is in the background of

these facts and circumstances that the petitioners have filed the

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014           3



above captioned Crl.M.C seeking invocation of the inherent

powers conferred on this court under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, with the prayer to quash the impugned

Annexure A final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime

No.496 of 2007 of Pandalam Police Station, which has led to the

pendency of S.C No.545 of 2012 on the file of the Sessions Court,

Pathanamthitta and all further proceedings arising therefrom.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.Johnson

Varikkappallil has taken notice for the 1st and 2nd respondents

and the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 3rd

respondent-State of Kerala.

      4.    Heard      Sri.Ajeesh.K.Sasi, the  learned    counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.Johnson Varikkappallil, learned

counsel appearing for 1st and 2nd respondents and the learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the 3rd respondent-State of

Kearla.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of the

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014          4



aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.Johnson  Varikkappallil,  the   learned   counsel

appearing for the 1st and 2nd respondents has submitted on the

basis of the specific instructions furnished by them that they

have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and that

they have no objection in the quashment of         the impugned

criminal proceedings.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014              5



that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and

not much element of public interest is involved. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents, it is clear

to the court that the injured/victims/defacto complainants have

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Apex Court in the case

between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1)

SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108

(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.      In what cases

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014                 6



          power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
          or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
          victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
          facts and circumstances of each case and no category
          can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
          offences          arising       from        commercial,
          financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
          the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
          criminal case would put accused to great oppression
          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
          and complete settlement and compromise with the
          victim........"

       In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014

(8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426

(SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

             "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
       entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
       peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
       proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace
       and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
       them".

       The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014          7



involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

Crl.M.C No.5809 of 2014               8



waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure A final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime

No.496 of 2007 of Pandalam Police Station which has led to the

pendency of S.C No.54537 of 2012 on the file of The Sessions

Court, Pathanamthitta and all further proceedings arising

therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners shall produce certified

copies of this order before the court below concerned as well as

before the Station House Officer, Pandalam Police Station.

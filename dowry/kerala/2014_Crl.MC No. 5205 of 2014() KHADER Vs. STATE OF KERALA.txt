          Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014.

                            O R D E R


      The petitioners herein are the accused in impugned

Annexure-1 FIR in Crime No.391/2012 of Edachery Police

Station alleging offences under Secs. 341, 323, 324 & 506 (i)

r/w 34 IPC. The above crime arose out of the complaint made

by the 2nd respondent (defacto complainant) pursuant to which

the police registered Annexure-1 Crime No.391/2012 of

Edachery Police Station. The police after investigation filed the

impugned Annexure-2 Final Report/Charge Sheet in the above

said Crime No.391/2012 of Edachery Police Station, which led

to the pendency of C.C.No.113/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara. It is stated that the

above case arose out of disputes between the petitioners and

2nd respondent (defacto complainant) and that now the entire

matter in disputes between the petitioners and the 2nd

respondent (defacto complainant) has been settled and that

they are on good terms as friends.            The 2nd respondent

(defacto complainant) has filed an affidavit dated 1.9.2014

produced as Annexure-3 in this Crl.M.C stating that the entire

                                ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

matter which led to the pendency of C.C.No.113/2013 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara has

been amicably settled between the 2nd respondent and the

petitioners pursuant to mediation and that they have decided

to settle the matter. That the 2nd respondent has no further

grievance against the petitioners or the accused in the above

case and the 2nd respondent has no intention to proceed with

the impugned proceedings any further and that he has no

objection to quash the impugned criminal proceedings which

led to the pendency of C.C.No.113/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara which arose out

of Crime No.391/2012 of Edachery Police Station. It is in the

background of these facts and circumstances, petitioners have

filed the instant Crl.M.C seeking invocation of the inherent

powers vested on this Court under Sec. 482 of the Cr.P.C with

the   prayer   to   quash    the   impugned  Annexure-2   Final

Report/Charge Sheet filed in impugned Annexure-1 Crime

No.391/2012 of Edachery Police Station, which led to the

pendency of C.C.No.113/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara and all further proceedings

arising therefrom.

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Smt.Reeha

Khader, Advocate, has taken notice for the respondent No.2

and the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.C.Bhaskaran, learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners, Smt.Reeha Khader, learned counsel

appearing for the respondent No.2 and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

      4.   The   learned    counsel   for  the   petitioners  has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Smt.Reeha Khader, learned counsel appearing for

respondent No.2 has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the respondent No.2 that respondent

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

No.2 has amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and

that he has no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners

as they have no grievance against them and that they will not

raise any dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing

the impugned final report is allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondent

No.2, it is clear to the Court that the injured/victim/defacto

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

complainant         has    no     further   grievance      against   the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived at by

them.

       8.      In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction

                                   ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

      is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
      put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
      criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim........"



In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in

2014 (8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR

426 (SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

             "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307

r/w Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.     Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

                               ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-2 Final Report/Charge Sheet filed in Annexure-1 FIR

in Crime No.391/2012 on the file of the Edachery Police

Station which led to the pendency of C.C.No.113/2013 on the

Crl.M.C.No.5205 Of 2014

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara and

all further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed, in the

interest of justice.    The petitioners shall produce certified

copies of this order before the Station House Officer concerned

as well as before the court below concerned.

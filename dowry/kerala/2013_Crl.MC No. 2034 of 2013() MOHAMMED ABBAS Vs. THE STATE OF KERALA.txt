                      Crl.M.C.No. 2034 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in S.C.No.15 of 2012 on the file

of the Principal Sessions Court, Kasaragod,                which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 391 of 2007 of Bekal

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 143,147,323

read with Section 149 of the I.P.C. And Section 3(1)(x) of the

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Attrocities)

Act,1989 with a prayer to quash Annexure A2 final report and all

further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.391/2007 of Bekal

Police Station which is now pending as S.C.No.15/2012 on the file of

the Principal Session's Court, Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of

court.

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

          2.  The allegation in the above case is that on 26.9.2007 at 8

p.m. at the Public road in Nalamvathukkal in Bara Village, the

accused, because of their previous enmity towards the de facto

complainant as the de facto complainant questioned the accused, as

they assaulted the brother of the de facto complainant, formed

themselves into an unlawful assembly and assaulted the de facto

complainant and M/s.Ramesh and Madhavan who were then

accompanying the de facto complainant by hands and abused them by

calling caste name, thereby the accused committed the above offences.

The investigation of the above crime was completed and the first

respondent filed Annexure A2 final report chargesheeting the accused

for the offences mentioned above.         Based on Annexure A2 final

report, the Magistrate initiated committal proceedings against the

accused and the case was committed to the Sessions Court, Kasaragod

for trial and disposal of the same. It is submitted that final report was

filed before the Magistrate against accused Nos.1,2 and 5 only, as the

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                   :-3-:

accused Nos.3,4 and 6 happened to be juveniles and therefore, the

final report as against accused Nos.3,4 and 6 were filed before the

Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod. The Sessions Court had taken

cognizance for the above offences and initiated proceedings in SC

No.15/2012 on its file.      Pursuant to the summons issued by the

sessions Court against the accused in the above S.C., the petitioner

who is the second accused in the above crime as well as in the above

S.C. appeared before the Sessions Court, Kasaragod and he was

enlarged on bail.      The other two accused viz., the first and fifth

accused did not surrender before the Sessions Court, kasaragod and

the case against them is split up and refiled as LPC No.69 of 2012 and

thus, the petitioner herein is the sole accused in SC No.15 of 2012 of

the Principal Sessions Court, Kasaragod.            Now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 to 4. I have also heard

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                 :-4-:

the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the party respondents, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondents submitted

that the above respondents, who are the de facto complainants do not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioner and they have no

grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsels.    I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.      In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                      :-5-:

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

143,147,323 read with Section 149 of the I.P.C. and Section 3(1)(x) of

the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Attrocities)

Act,1989, which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences

are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the de facto

complainants have no further grievance against the petitioner/ accused

in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                              :-6-:

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                             :-7-:

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"


         8.       According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. I am of the view that as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

in the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste

of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2034 of 2013

                                  :-8-:

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure A2

final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime

No.391/2007 of Bekal Police Station which is now pending as

S.C.No.15/2012 on the file of the Principal Session's Court,

Kasaragod.

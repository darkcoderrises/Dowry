             -------------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C.No.620 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 14th day of March, 2014

                              ORDER

       This petition is filed u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash

Annexures-1 and 2 in Crime No.1475/2011 of Chavara

Police Station, which is pending before Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Karunagappally u/s.498A r/w 34 IPC, by

invoking the inherent jurisdiction. Petitioners, who are 3rd

and 4th accused in the above case, allege that no materials

are produced against them to attract the alleged offence.

The 2nd petitioner is living in her matrimonial house and she

has no contact with the 1st respondent.            The petitioners

contended that since the allegations are baseless and if the

trial is proceeded, it is a mere abuse of process of Court.

       2.   The allegation of the 1st respondent, who lodged

Annexure-1 in Chavara Police Station, was that her marriage

Crl.M.C.No.620/13               2

was solemnized on 12.7.2009 with the 1st accused in the

above case as per customary rites in their community.

After the marriage, she was residing in the matrimonial

house. While residing there, the accused in the above

case    ill-treated    her both   physically and    mentally,

demanding more amount as dowry.           When ill-treatment

continued, she was forced to file Annexure-1 in the

Chavara Police Station.      After completing investigation,

Chavara Police filed Annexure-2 final report before

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Karunagappally and

the trial is pending in that Court.

      3.    The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

contended that the petitioners are innocent and the 1st

respondent has not sustained any external injury.

Annexure-A1/8 produced along with Annexure-1 is the

wound        certificate  issued   from     A.M.    Hospital,

Karunagappally. Hence, they pray to invoke the inherent

Crl.M.C.No.620/13                  3

jurisdiction.

      4.    The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

prima facie case is made out against the petitioners and

after completing investigation, Annexure-2 final report was

filed before the Court. If any interference is made at this

stage, it will affect credibility of the prosecution case.

      5.    The    inherent     powers   of  the   High   Court

contemplated u/s 482 Cr.P.C. has to be exercised only for

the three purposes mentioned in the Section. This power

cannot be invoked naturally in a matter where it is covered

by a specific provision of the code. Therefore it means

that if the matter in question is not covered by any

provision of the code, it comes into operation, for the three

purposes mentioned in the section, i.e. to make such

orders necessary to "give effect to any order" under this

code or to prevent "abuse of the process" of any court or

to secure "the ends of justice". Apex Court in State of

Haryana V. Bhajanlal, [1992 SCC (Crl) 426] held as follows:

Crl.M.C.No.620/13                     4

                  "where the allegations made in the FIR or
           complaint     are    so   absurd and   inherently
           improbable on the basis of which no prudent
           person can ever reach a just conclusion that
           there is sufficient ground for proceeding against
           the accused, the proceedings are liable to be
           quashed".

      6.    The High Court while exercising its powers

under Section 482 of the Code cannot reject the

investigation report which is filed before the Magistrate.

Apex Court in Pratibha Rani V. Suraj (AIR 1985 (2)SC

370), this court observed as follows.

                 "It is well settled by a long course of
           decisions of this Court that for the purpose of
           exercising its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
           quash a FIR or a complaint the High Court would
           have to proceed entirely on the basis of the
           allegations  made     in  the complaint or  the
           documents accompanying the same per se. It has
           no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or
           otherwise of the allegations"

The facts and circumstances of this case show that prima

facie case is made out against the accused in the above

case.      Annexure-I is the FIR. Annexure-2 is the final

report.     The investigating agency interrogated several

Crl.M.C.No.620/13              5

witnesses and recorded the statement.

      Therefore, when prima facie case is made out

against the petitioners, this is not a fit case to invoke the

inherent jurisdiction. In the circumstance, this petition is

dismissed accordingly.     However, the petitioners are at

liberty to take all defence in the trial Court in support of

their contentions.



                                    P.D. RAJAN, JUDGE.

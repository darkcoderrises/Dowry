                     B.A. No. 4720 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 3rd day of July, 2014


                           O R D E R

           Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners are accused in Crime No.592/2014 of

Nilambur Police Station, which has been registered for

offences under sections 406 and 498A of IPC.

     3.    The 1st petitioner is the husband of the 1st

informant and the other petitioners are his parents. It is

alleged that the petitioners misappropriated the properties

of the 1st informant and subjected her to cruelty demanding

more dowry.

     4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.    The 1st petitioner and the 1st informant have been

married for two years only.       They have no issues.   The

prosecution has no case that the petitioners inflicted any

                               -2-



physical injury to the 1st informant.           It appears that

restoration of peace to the family is not impossible. If the

petitioners happen to be detained, it will only frustrate the

attempt.     So I am inclined to grant the prayer of the

petitioners.

     6.    In the result, this application is allowed.

      i.   The petitioners shall be released on bail on

           their executing a bond for Rs.20,000/-

           (Rupees Twenty thousand only) each with

           two solvent sureties each for the like sum

           if they are arrested by the Police in

           connection with this case.

      ii.  They shall appear before the Investigating

           Officer for interrogation if they are so

           required by him in writing.

      iii. They shall not harass the 1st informant or

           her close relatives.

B.A. No. 4720 of 2014
                              -3-




     This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose to

surrender before the Magistrate concerned and in such case

the learned Magistrate may take appropriate action in

accordance with the law.

               In this Petition filed under Sec. 438 Cr.P.C. the petitioners,


who are the accused in Crime No.176/07 of Trithala Police Station for an


offence   punishable   under   Sec.417   IPC   read   with   section   4   of   Dowry


(Prohibition) Act, seek anticipatory bail.


       2.      I   heard     the   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioners   and   the


learned Public Prosecutor.


       3.      Having   regard   to   the   nature   of   the   allegations   levelled


against   the   petitioners   and   the   other   circumstances   of   the   case,   I   am


inclined   to   grant   anticipatory   bail   to   the   petitioners.     Accordingly,   a


direction is issued to the officer-in-charge of the police station concerned


to release the petitioners on bail for a period of one month  in the event


of   their   arrest   in   connection   with   the   above   case   on   each   of   them


executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only)   with two


solvent sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction to the said


officer and subject to the following conditions:




               a.      Petitioners   1,   2   and   4   shall   report

               before   the   Investigating   Officer   between   9

               a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Wednesdays.

              b.     Petitioners   shall   make     themselves

              available   for   interrogation   as   and   when

              required by the  Investigating Officer.




              c.     Petitioners   shall   not   influence   or

              intimidate   the   prosecution   witnesses   nor

              shall   they   attempt   to   tamper   with   the

              evidence for the prosecution.




              d.     Petitioners   shall   not   commit   any

              offence while on bail.




                e.         Petitioners shall surrender before the

              Magistrate concerned and seek regular bail

              in the meanwhile.




       If  the   petitioners   commit   breach  of   any  of  the  above  conditions,


the bail granted to them shall be liable to be cancelled.





       This application is allowed as above.





                                                     (V. RAMKUMAR, JUDGE)

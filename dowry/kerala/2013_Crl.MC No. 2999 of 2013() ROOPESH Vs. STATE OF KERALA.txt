                    Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 22nd day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime

No.1350/13 of Aluva east Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 324, 326, 149

of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 FIR        as the

matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The prosecution case is that the de facto

complainant is an engineering student in Bangalore.      He is

studying there for the last 2 years and he came to his house

by taking leave and for celebrating "Vishu". The matter being

so, on 20.4.2013 at about 7 pm the second respondent, his

mother and his mothers sister were going along in the

procession of Kadungalloor Narasimha Swami Temple in

connection with Arattu. When the second respondent reached

at aqueduct the petitioners attacked the de facto complainant

and he sustained fracture on mouth. Thus according to the

prosecution, the petitioners are committed the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 324, 326, 149

Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013              2




of IPC. Now the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled between himself and the de facto complainant as the

issue connected with the temple procession at the intervention

of the mediators. Annexure-A2 is the agreement arrived into

the parties and Annexure-A3 is the affidavit sworn into by the

de facto complainant who is the second respondent in the

above case.

              3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

              4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.              Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

              5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013               3




against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

              6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

              7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 324,

326, 149 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved.         It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013                 4




Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-




                       "57. The position that emerges from
             the above discussion can be summarised
             thus:       the power of the High Court in
             quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
             complaint      in  exercise  of   its  inherent
             jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
             power       given to   a  criminal   court   for
             compounding the offences under S.320 of
             the Code.        Inherent power is of wide
             plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
             has to be exercised in accord with the
             guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
             secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
             abuse of the process of any Court. In what
             cases       power  to    quash   the    criminal
             proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
             exercised where the offender and victim
             have settled their dispute would depend on
             the facts and circumstances of each case
             and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

              "......... But the criminal cases having
              overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
              flavour stand on different footing for the
              purposes      of quashing,   particularly  the
              offences arising from commercial, financial,
              mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
              transactions or the offences arising out of
              matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
              family disputes where the wrong is basically

Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013               5




              private or personal in nature and the
              parties have resolved their entire dispute.
              In this category of cases, High Court may
              quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
              because of the compromise between the
              offender and victim, the possibility of
              conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
              continuation of criminal case would put
              accused to great oppression and prejudice
              and extreme injustice would be caused to
              him by not quashing the criminal case
              despite    full and complete settlement and
              compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

Crl.M.C.No.2999 of 2013            6




cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

              In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 F.I.R in Crime No.1350 of 2013 of Aluva Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

                  Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                ---------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 1st             April, 2014

                             O R D E R

     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 4 in

S.C. 542/12 on the file of the              Additional District and

Sessions Court - II, N.Parur to quash the proceedings on

the basis of     settlement      under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 to 4 in S.C. No. 542/2012 on the file of the

Additional District and Sessions Court - II, North Paravur,

Ernakulam District. The case was registered on the basis of

a statement given by the 2nd respondent as defacto

complainant as crime No. 1/2006 of Puthenvelikkara Police

Station alleging offences under Sections 447 and 435

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.                      After

investigation, Annexure - A1 final report was filed against

the petitioners and it was originally taken on file as

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                                   2

C.C.130/2006.       Thereafter it was committed to Sessions

Court after converting            the same as C.P. and after

committal, the case was taken on file as S.C. 542/2012 and

the same was made over to Additional Sessions Court No. II,

North Paravur for disposal.            Now the matter has been

settled between the parties. The defacto complainant does

not want      to proceed with the investigation. In view of the

settlement, the possibility of conviction is remote. Since it

is non-compoundable offence,            they could not move the

court below for compounding. So petitioners have no other

remedy except to approach this Court seeking the following

reliefs:

             "For these and other grounds to be urged at

             the time of hearing, it is humbly prayed that

             the Honourable Court may7 be pleased to allow

             the Criminal Miscellaneous Case    and quash

             Annexure - A1, charge sheet and the entire

             proceedings in S.C. No. 542/2012       of the

             Additional District and Sessions Court, North

             Paravur in Ernakulam District, so as to secure

             the ends of justice".

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                              3




      3. The 2nd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the incident happened due to some mis-

understanding between      the petitioners and the defacto

complainant and now misunderstanding has been resolved

and the matter has been settled    and their friendship has

been restored due to intervention of mediators and family

members. They do not want to proceed with the

investigation and he filed Annexure - A2 affidavit stating

all these facts.

      4.    The Counsel for the     first  respondent also

submitted that in view of the settlement,       there is no

possibility of conviction and so he prayed for allowing the

application,.

      5. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor,

on instructions, as directed by this Court, submitted that

there is no other case against the petitioners and they have

no criminal background but opposed the application on the

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                              4

ground that grave offence has been committed.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Crime No 1/2006 of

Puthenvelikkara Police Station was registered against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 447 and 435

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and after

investigation     Annexure - A1 final report was filed and

thereafter it was committed to the Sessions Court and it

was taken on file as S.C. 542/2012 and then made over to

Additional Sessions Court -II, North Paravur, Ernakulam

District for disposal.    Now the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of mediators

and well-wishers.

      7. It is also seen from the allegations in the final

report that the incident     happened due to the     some

misunderstanding between petitioners and the defacto

complainant. It is seen from Annexure - A2 affidavit that

the mis-understanding      has now been settled   due   to

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                                       5

intervention of mediators and              their friendship has been

restored and he does not want to prosecute the petitioners

any more. In view of the settlement there is no possibility

of the defacto complainant or his witnesses supporting the

prosecution and conviction in such case will be remote. It

cannot be said to be an offence against the Society as such.

But it was happened due to                   some misunderstanding

between the petitioners and the 2nd respondent which has

been settled now. Proceedings with the prosecution under

such circumstance will be only a wastage of judicial time.

      8.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
     be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
     criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
     inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
     given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
     S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
     statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
     guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
     justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
     what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
     or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
     settled  their    dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
     circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
     However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
     have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                                       6

     Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
     like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
     even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
     settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
     have serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
     between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
     under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
     offences committed by public servants while working in that
     capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
     proceedings involving such offences.       But the criminal cases
     having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
     on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
     the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
     partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
     of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
     where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
     the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
     of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
     view, because of the compromise between the offender and
     victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
     continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
     oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
     caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
     complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
     words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
     or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
     criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
     would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
     and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
     whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
     criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
     question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
     its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


      9.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been     settled between the parties due to intervention of

mediators and harmony has been restored between them

Crl.M.C. No. 1821 of 2014
                                 7

and on account of settlement they do not want to prosecute

the case and no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case and conviction in such case will be remote, this

Court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Code of          Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote              the

settlement which restored the relationship between the

parties.     So the      application is allowed and  further

proceedings in S.C. 542/2012            (Crime No.1/2006 of

Puthenvelikara Police Station) pending before            the

Additional District and Sessions Court-II. North Paravur as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned Court immediately.

                              ORDER




     This is a petition filed u/s 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.



2.   The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.229 of 2010

on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I,

Mavelikkara. He is proceeded against in that case for

having committed offence punishable u/s 498A of the

IPC. The 2nd respondent in this case was his wife. The

prayer in this case is to quash all further proceedings in

the above case on the ground that the matter has been

settled between the parties.



3.   Originally the case was charge sheeted against six

accused by the Sub Inspector of police, Mavelikkara, for

having committed offence u/s 498A of the IPC and the

same was pending as C.C.470 of 2009 on the files of the

Crl.M.C.1599/13
                               2

Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Mavelikkara. Since the

petitioner was working abroad, he did not appear before

the learned Magistrate and hence, the case against him

was split up. As per judgment dated 27.5.2010, accused

Nos. 2 to 6 were found not guilty and were acquitted u/s

248(1) of the Cr.P.C.



3.     During the pendency of the case, the matter was

settled     between  the  parties.  Annexure-A1     is  the

settlement deed      entered into     in M.C.48 of 2009

preferred by the 2nd respondent against the petitioner.

Annexure-A2 is the order in M.C.48 of 2009 which reveals

that the matter was settled on the strength of a

compromise entered into between the parties. Annexure-

A3 is the judgment dated 3.8.2010 of the Family Court,

Alappuzha as per which the marriage between the

petitioner and the 2nd respondent was dissolved u/s 13B

of the Hindu Marriage Act. Annexure-A4 is the judgment

in C.C.470 of 2009 on the file of the Judicial magistrate of

Frist Class, Mavelikkara from which it is revealed that the

Crl.M.C.1599/13
                                 3

2nd respondent had turned hostile and had stated before

Court that she was not subjected to cruelty or harassment

for or in connection with demand for dowry.        The learned

Magistrate has acquitted the accused u/s 248(1) of the

Cr.P.C after finding that the de facto complainant who is

the 2nd respondent herein has settled the dispute with the

accused.



4.     I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.



5.     I have anxiously perused the judgment rendered by

the learned Magistrate In C.C.470 of 2009. Accused Nos.

2 to 6 were acquitted in the said case, since PW1 in the

said case, who is none other than the 2nd respondent

herein, had turned hostile and stated that she was not

subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection

with any demand for dowry.



6.     In view of the above , it is felt that no purpose will be

Crl.M.C.1599/13
                                  4

served in subjecting the parties to the ordeal of a

protracted trial in view of the settlement. It will only enure

to waste valuable judicial hours. I am, therefore, of the

view that the criminal proceedings pending as against the

petitioner can be quashed by invoking the inherent

powers of this Court under S. 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.



8.     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The final report

in C.C. No.229 of 2010 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrates Court-1, Mavelikkara and all further

proceedings in the said case are quashed.

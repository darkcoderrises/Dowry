                Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
         --------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 20th day of August, 2013


                           O R D E R

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused nos. 3 & 4 in

C.C.No.5309/2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Ernakulam, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No. 2469/2010 of the Central

Police Station, Kochi City for the offences punishable

under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(1), 323 and 447 r/w

Section 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings      as    against     the     petitioners     in CC

No.5309/2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate-II, Ernakulam, as the matter is settled out of

court.

     2.   The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioners and the other accused, on 02.09.2010 at about

Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
                              ..2..

8.30 pm, restrained the way of the 2nd respondent/de

facto complainant, to take his bike out of his office

premises with the 4th respondent's car having registration

no. KL-43-B-6006 and the 2nd respondent argued with the

petitioners and other accused.       Petitioners and other

accused with a criminal intention trespassed into the

office premises and used abusive words against the 2nd

respondent and manhandled him. Thus, according to the

prosecution, the accused have committed the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(1), 323 and

447 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C.       Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the entire dispute is settled between

the petitioners and the 2nd respondent as per Annexure

A2 compounding petition, which is signed by the

petitioners and the 2nd respondent and countersigned by

the respective counsel. The 2nd respondent, who is the de

facto complainant, has also sworn into Annexure A3

affidavit.

       3.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the 2nd respondent.      I have also heard the

Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
                              ..3..

learned Public Prosecutor.

       4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

       5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who

on the basis of specific instruction received     from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

       6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents

and materials produced along with the above petition. In

the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
                                      ..4..

       7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341,

294(b), 506(1), 323 and 447 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C.,

which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

by them.        In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                    "57. The position that emerges from the above
              discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
              High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
              complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
              distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
              court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
              Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
              statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord

Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
                                      ..5..

              with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
              secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
              process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
              criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
              exercised where the offender and victim have settled
              their     dispute  would    depend   on  the   facts  and
              circumstances of each case and no category can be
              prescribed.."


It is further held as follows:-

              "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
              and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
              footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
              offences arising from commercial, financial,mercandile,
              civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
              offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc.
              or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
              private or personal in nature and the parties have
              resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases,
              High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
              view, because of the compromise between the offender
              and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
              bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
              accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
              injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
              criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
              compromise with the victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances            involved     in    the    present     case     and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

Crl. M.C. No. 1796 of 2012
                               ..6..

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event

of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No. 5309 of 2010 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam.

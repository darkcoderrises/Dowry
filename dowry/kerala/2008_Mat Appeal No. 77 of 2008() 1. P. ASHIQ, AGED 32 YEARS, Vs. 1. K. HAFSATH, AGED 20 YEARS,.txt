                    Dated this the 4th day of March, 2008

                                  JUDGMENT

Harun-Ul-Rashid, J.

      Mat. Appeal No. 77 of 2008 is filed by the respondent in O.P.

No.191 of 2007 on the file of the Family Court, Malappuram. He is the

applicant in I.A. Nos.1662 of 2007 and 1663 of 2007. The above two

interlocutory applications were filed for setting aside the ex parte order

dated 1.6.2007 and for condonation of delay in filing the application for

setting aside the ex parte order.        The Family Court dismissed both the

applications.   Being aggrieved by the order of dismissal, the above

Matrimonial Appeal is filed.



      2. The appellant in Mat. Appeal No.78 of 2008 is the respondent in

the connected Original Petition, O.P. No,.192 of 2007 before the same

court.   The parties are the same. The appellant filed two interlocutory

applications, I.A. Nos.1665 of 2007 and 1666 of 2007, for setting aside the

ex parte order dated 1.6.2007 and for condonation of delay in filing the

Mat. Appeal No.77/2008
& Connected Cases                     2




application for setting aside the ex parte order.        The Family Court

dismissed both the applications against which this appeal is filed.



      3. Mat. Appeal No.80 of 2008 is filed against the order in I.A.

Nos.1668 of 2007 and 1669 of 2007 in O.P.No.193 of 2007 before the

same court for setting aside the ex parte order dated 1.6.2007 and for

condonation of delay in filing the application for setting aside the ex parte

order. The Family Court dismissed both the applications and hence, this

appeal.



      4. W.P.(C) No.4071 of 2008 is filed by the appellant in the above

appeals with the following prayer:



                    "Call for the records leading to Exts.P2
             and P3 orders, examine the same and quash
             Ext.P3 order in so far as it imposes the highly
             onerous condition of      depositing the entire
             arrears upto the date of Ext.P3 which comes to
             Rs.40,000.00 (Rupees Forty thousand only) and
             delete the said condition and direct the Family
             Court, Malappuram to forthwith take up M.C.
             No.205/2007 and permit the petitioner to file
             objections in the M.C. and give an opportunity
             to the petitioner to have the said     M.C. case
             heard on merits after giving evidence.

Mat. Appeal No.77/2008
& Connected Cases                       3




The Family Court allowed M.C. No.205 of 2007 and directed the

petitioner herein to pay maintenance to the respondent at the rate of

Rs.5,000/- per month from the date of filing of the M.C. case.          The

petitioner herein was set ex parte in the proceedings before the Family

Court. He, therefore, filed C.M.P. No.2202 of 2007 for setting aside the

ex parte order.    The said petition was allowed on condition that the

petitioner deposits the entire arrears of maintenance on or before

5.12.2007 failing which the petition shall stand dismissed with costs.



       5. O.P. No.191 of 2007 was filed by the respondent herein seeking

past maintenance of Rs.40,000/- with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. O.P.

No.192 of 2007 was filed by her seeking recovery of dowry amount of

Rs.3,10,000/-. The respondent also filed O.P. No.193 of 2007 and M.C.

No.205 of 2007 seeking dissolution of marriage under Section 2(viii)(a)(d)

of Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act and for maintenance at the rate of

Rs.5,000/- per month. The appellant who is the respondent in the above

Original Petitions and M.C. case was absent and set ex parte.



       6. The respective interlocutory applications mentioned above are

filed in all the four cases for setting aside the ex parte order and also for

Mat. Appeal No.77/2008
& Connected Cases                      4




condoning the delay in filing the application to set aside the ex parte order.

The appellant submitted that he is employed abroad and, therefore, there

was no occasion for him to receive the notice in the above mentioned

proceedings. He further submitted that he came to know of the ex parte

orders only on 26.2.2007 when he came down to Kerala.                He also

submitted that considerable hardship will be caused to him if the ex parte

orders are sustained. The respondent submitted that notice was served by

affixture and by publication in the Newspaper and it was only thereafter

that the appellant was set ex parte and hence, there is no reason to set aside

the orders under challenge.



      7. It is a fact that all the four cases were decided without contest.

The appellant prays for an opportunity to present his case for a decision on

merits. We are of the view that in the interest of justice, an opportunity

has to be given to the appellant to contest the cases on merits on condition

that the appellant pays Rs.5,000/- as costs.



      In the result, Matrimonial Appeal Nos.77 of 2008, 78 of 2008 and

80 of 2008 and W.P.(C) No.4071 of 2008 are allowed. The interlocutory

applications filed in O.P. Nos.191, 192 and 193 of 2007 and in M.C.

Mat. Appeal No.77/2008
& Connected Cases                     5




No.205 of 2007 are allowed setting aside the orders under challenge. The

appellant shall pay costs to the tune of Rs.5,000/- within one month from

today, failing which the applications shall stand dismissed. There will be

no order as to costs.

          ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 26th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No. 2212/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thrissur which is a case

instituted upon the police report for the offences punishable

under Sections 448, 341, 323, 294(b), 506(ii), 427 r/w

Section 34 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash Annexure A2

charge sheet in C.C.No. 2212/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Thrissur in Crime No.902/2012 of Thrissur

East Police Station, Thrissur District as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the defacto

complainant is the husband of the 1st petitioner, that the other

petitioners are relative of petitioner No.1 and that on

10/5/2012 at 7 a.m., the petitioners trespassed into the flat of

the defacto complainant at Thrissur and assaulted him and

committed mischiefs. Thus, according to the prosecution,

allegation is that the accused who are 4 in numbers committed

offences punishable under Sections 448, 341, 323, 294(b),

Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
                               2

506(ii), 427 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., and thus Crime

No.902/2012 was registered in the Thrissur Police Station.

According to the petitioners subsequently the disputes

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant who is

the second respondent herein settled the matter as per joint

petition    which     is filed in  the   above    Crl.M.C  as

Crl.M.A.No.5948/2013,which is signed by the petitioners and

the second respondent and counter signed by the respective

counsels. The second respondent has also sworn into an

affidavit dated 15/7/2013 acknowledging the above facts.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
                               3

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 448, 341, 323, 294(b),

506(ii), 427 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.     It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
                                    4

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
                                     5

         or such like transactions or the offences arising out

         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

Crl.M.C.No. 3128 of 2013
                                 6

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2      and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 2212/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Thrissur and all further proceedings thereto.

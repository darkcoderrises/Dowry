                         --------------------------------------------

                           Dated this the 23rd January,  2008


                                        JUDGMENT




        Appellant   in   all   these   appeals   is   Jaya   George,   who   instituted


O.S.No.364 of  1994 and O.S.No.210 of  1996 while she was the second


defendant  in O.S.No.358 of  1994.    The suits filed by Jaya George were


dismissed by the trial court and the Appellate Court confirmed the same.


The suit filed against Jaya George by Radhakrishnan Nair was decreed by


the trial court and it was confirmed in appeal.





        2.     O.S.No.358   of   1994   was   filed   by   Radhakrishnan   Nair   against


three   persons,   namely,   Mathai   Ommen,   his   wife   Jaya   George   and


P.K.George, who is the  vendor of  the  property to Mathai  Ommen.   That


suit was for declaration of title and recovery of possession in respect of 14


cents   of   land.     O.S.No.364   of   1994   was   filed   by   Jaya   George   against


Radhakrishnan Nair for a permanent prohibitory injunction.  O.S.No.210 of


1996   was   filed   by   Jaya   George   against   P.K.George   for   permanent


prohibitory injunction.  The property scheduled in O.S.No.364 of 1994 and


O.S.No.210  of   1996  is having an   extent  of   ten  cents   and  it  is  the  same


property.





        3.     The   case   of   Radhakrishnan   Nair   is   that   he   purchased   the


property having an extent of 14 cents from Kizhakkethalackal Samuel as


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                                ::  2  ::


per document No.1612 of 1979.  Kizhakkethalackal Samuel had obtained


Ext.A1 purchase certificate from the Land Tribunal.   Radhakrishnan Nair


had filed O.S.No.290 of 1987 against P.K.George, his wife Sosamma and


sister Achamma for declaration of title and for injunction in respect of the


extent   of   14   cents.     O.S.No.290   of   1987   was   decreed   exparte   on


13.7.1992.  The case of Radhakrishnan Nair is that in spite of the decree


in   O.S.NO.290   of   1987,   the   defendants   trespassed   upon   the   property


and, therefore, he was constrained to file O.S.No.358 of 1994.





        4.  The case of Jaya George, who instituted two suits as mentioned


above   and   who   contested   O.S.No.358   of   1994   filed   by   Radhakrishnan


Nair,   is   that   the   property   having   an   extent   of   ten   cents   belonged   to


P.K.George, the third defendant in O.S.No.358 of 1994.  P.K.George sold


the property to Mathai Ommen (husband of Jaya George) in 1993 as per


Ext.B2   document   No.950/1993.     Mathai   Ommen   settled   the   property   in


favour   of   Jaya   George   as   per   Ext.B3   settlement   deed   executed   in   the


year 1994.





        5.     In   the   written   statement   filed   by   Radhakrishnan   Nair   in


O.S.No.364   of   1994,   he   contended   that   he   has   title   to   an   extent   of   14


cents   of   land   including   the   plaint   schedule   property   in   O.S.No.364   of


1994, ie., ten cents of land.  It is also contended in the written statement


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                                ::  3  ::


that O.S.No.290 of  1987  was filed  by him  in respect   of  the  extent of  14


cents of land and that suit was decreed.





        6.     P.K.George, who assigned the property to Mathai Ommen as


per   Ext.B2,   contended   in   the   written   statement   filed   in   O.S.No.210   of


1996   (filed   by   Jaya   George)     that   the   disputed   property   belongs   to


Radhakrishnan Nair.   He also stated in the written statement that Mathai


Ommen proposed to marry the daughter of P.K.George in 1993.   It was


agreed to give dowry to Mathai Ommen and as a security for the payment


of dowry, document No.950/1993 was executed by P.K.George in favour


of Mathai Ommen.  Mathai Ommen had subsequently withdrawn from the


proposal for marriage.  Later, Mathai Ommen and his father, with the help


of     some  policemen,   illegally trespassed upon the property situated on


the   northern   side   of   his   property.     That   property   which   was   trespassed


upon belongs to Radhakrishnan Nair.   Mathai Ommen and Jaya George


have no right or title in respect of that property.





        7.   In the written statement filed by Jaya George in O.S.No.358 of


1994   it   was   contended   that   the   plaint   schedule   property   is   not   properly


identified   and   that   it   was   necessary   to   identify   and   locate   the   property.


Though   a   specific   case   was   put   forward   by   Radhakrishnan   Nair   in


O.S.No.358   of   1994   that   the   same   extent   of   14   cents   was   the   suit


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                               ::  4  ::


property in O.S.No.290  of  1987 filed  by him,  that  specific  averment  was


not   denied   by   Jaya   George   in   her   written   statement   in   O.S.No.358   of


1994.





         8.   A Commissioner was appointed in O.S.No.364 of 1994 filed by


Jaya  George    and  a  sketch  was produced.     From  the  sketch,  it  is  clear


that the property claimed by Jaya George is situated on the northern side


of   the   property   belonging   to   Puthuparambil   George   and   on   the   eastern


side   of   PWD   road.     That   property   is   also   bounded   on   the   east   by   the


property of Easo Yohannan.   Jaya George had no dispute regarding the


identification of the property claimed by her and noted in the sketch.  She


has also no dispute about the boundaries noted by the Commissioner in


Ext.C1(a)   sketch.     In   the   schedule   to   O.S.No.290   of   1987   filed   by


Radhakrishnan  Nair  and  which was decreed  earlier,  it is mentioned  that


the property involved in that suit is an extent of 14 cents on the northern


side of the property belonging to defendants 2 and 3 in that suit, namely,


P.K.George and Sosamma George.  In the plaint schedule in O.S.No.364


of   1994,   the   southern   boundary   is   shown   as   the   property   belonging   to


Puthuparambil George and the western boundary is shown as PWD road.


The  eastern  boundary is    Easo  Yohannan's   property.    In  O.S.No.210  of


1996 also the same boundaries which are shown in O.S.No.364 of 1994


are shown.


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                               ::  5  ::


       9.  A contention was put forward by Jaya George that the property


claimed   by   Radhakrishnan   Nair   is   not   identified   with   reference   to   the


documents  and  survey records  and,   therefore,  O.S.No.358  of   1994   was


liable  to  be  dismissed.     The  trial  court  considered   the  documentary and


oral evidence in great detail and held at paragraph 29 thus:




               "29.     At   this   stage   another   contention   raised   by   the

       learned   counsel   for   the   defendants   1   and   2   requires

       consideration.     According   to   the   learned   counsel,   this

       (O.S.358/94) suit being a suit for declaration and recovery of

       possession the plaintiff ought to have identified and located

       the property sought to be recovered by measuring it as per

       survey   plan   by   taking   out   a   commissioner   and   surveyor.

       True, ordinarily in a suit for recovery of possession, court will

       insist   on   identification   of   the   property   by   obtaining   a

       commission report and plan.   But in my opinion, in the case

       in   hand   such   a   course   is   not   at   all   necessary   because

       except   the   difference   in   the   extent,   both   the   parties   are

       claiming   one   and   the   same   property   lying   within   the   same

       boundaries.  The said fact is admitted by both the parties  at

       the   time   of   their   examination   in   the   case.     Moreover   the

       Commissioner   deputed   from   O.S.No.364/94   has   prepared

       and submitted a sketch showing the side measurements of

       the   scheduled   property   in   that   case   which   is   the   subject

       matter of dispute in all these cases.  The Commissioner has

       reported   that   the   said   property   is   clearly   demarcated   from

       the adjacent properties on its four sides by fencing.   In this

       connection it is also to be remembered that both the plaintiff

       and   defendants   have   no   other   property   in   the   spot   other

       than   the   scheduled   items.     The   3rd  defendant   who   has   got

       property on the south of  the disputed property has made  it

       clear   that   the   scheduled   property   is   not   the   property

       obtained by him as per purchase certificate No.3195/77 and

       conveyed   by   him   to   the   1st  defendant   as   per   Ext.B2.     So

       what   can   be   understood   from   the   above   facts   and

       circumstances   is   that   it   is   not   the   identity   of   the   property

       which is in dispute but its title which I have already found in

       favour of the plaintiff.   Therefore it follows that the plaintiff is

       entitled   to   recover   the   property   now   remaining   in   the


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                                ::  6  ::


        possession   of   defendants   1   and   2   and   shown   by   the

        Commissioner in the Ext.C1(a) sketch in yellow shade."




        10.     The   trial   court,   after   referring   to   the   oral   and   documentary


evidence, held that Jaya George and Mathai Ommen have not obtained


title or possession over the scheduled property.  It was also found by the


trial  court   that  the   defendants   in  O.S.No.358  of  1994   had  dispossessed


Radhakrishnan Nair.   The trial court held that O.S.No.358 of 1994 filed by


Radhakrishnan   Nair   is   liable   to   be   decreed   and   the   other   suits   filed   by


Jaya George are liable to be dismissed.





        11.  It is also relevant to note that both the courts below noticed the


following aspects:  (1)  That Jaya George has not produced the purchase


certificate   obtained   by     P.K.George   as   per   which   he   claimed   title.     (2)


Though   Ext.B2   assignment   deed   executed   by   P.K.George   in   favour   of


Mathai  Ommen  was produced,  the  last  page  containing  the schedule of


the property was missing and no explanation was offered by Jaya George


for the same.   (3)   Radhakrishnan Nair has not produced the sale deed,


No.1612/1979,   executed   by   Samuel   in   his   favour.     These   observations


made by the courts below would indicate that both parties did not take the


Court into confidence and did not produce all the relevant records before


Court.  Parties were also reluctant to take out a Commission and to have


a proper  and  effective trial  of  the case.   While  Radhakrishnan  Nair  was


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                                ::  7  ::


satisfied   with   the   decree   which   he   obtained   in   O.S.No.290   of   1987   in


support of  his contentions,  Jaya George was satisfied with the failure of


Radhakrishnan   Nair   to   take   out   a   Commission     to   identify   the   property.


The Second Appellate Court cannot be expected to remand matters to the


trial court for fresh disposal after  affording the parties to the litigation   a


further opportunity to adduce evidence, when they did not care to adduce


proper evidence before the trial court.  The parties cannot be allowed   to


protract the case and to indulge in unending litigation.  The question to be


looked   into   is   whether   the   judgments   rendered   by   the   courts   below   are


liable to be interfered with in Second Appeal and whether any substantial


question of law as provided in Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure


is involved.





        12.  The Appellate Court also considered the documentary and oral


evidence   in   detail   and   concurred   with   the   view   taken   by   the   trial   court.


The Appellate Court noticed in paragraph 18 of the judgment thus:




                 "The   property   described   in   the   plaint   schedule   in

        O.S.No.358/94   is   14   cents   comprised   of     Sy.No.62/1   and

        there   is   no   dispute   to   the   position   that   the   property

        described   in   the   plaint   schedule   in   O.S.No.364/94   and

        210/96   is   a   portion   of   the   property   described   in   the   plaint

        schedule in O.S.No.358/94...."




This   statement   in   paragraph   18   is   not   disputed.     That   means,   there


cannot be any dispute regarding   identity of the property.   If the property


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                               ::  8  ::


involved in O.S.No.358 of 1994 is the same property as was involved in


O.S.No.290 of 1987, Jaya George would not be entitled to claim any title


or legal possession in respect of the property, she being the assignee of


P.K.George   and     P.K.George   being     a   party   to   O.S.No.290   of   1987.


Therefore, for the effective disposal of the case, it is sufficient to consider


the   question   whether   the   property   involved   in   O.S.No.290   of   1987   and


that   involved   in   O.S.No.358   of   1994   is   one   and   the   same.     Though


Radhakrishnan Nair made a specific averment in O.S.No.358 of 1994 that


property involved in both the suits is the same, there was no denial of the


same by Jaya George in the written statement filed by her.  Therefore, all


the contentions now raised by the appellant regarding lack of identification


of the plaint schedule property are without any substance.  The Appellate


Court   dealt   with   this   aspect   in   paragraphs   23   and   24   of   the   judgment,


which read as follows:




                "23.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   has

        submitted that the plaint schedule property in O.S.No.358/94

        and   the   plaint   schedule   property   in   O.S.No.290/87   are

        entirely   different   properties.     The   1st  respondent   has

        specifically   alleged   in   the   plaint   in   O.S.No.358/94   that   he

        instituted a suit as O.S.No.290/87 against the 3rd  defendant

        therein,   his   wife   and   sister   and   obtained   a   decree   in   his

        favour as  prayed   for  and   in spite   of   such  an   allegation  the

        appellants   who   are   defendants   1   and   2   in   O.S.No.358/94

        have   not   raised   a   contention   in   their   written   statement

        therein   that   the   plaint   schedule   property   therein   is   not   the

        plaint   schedule   property   in   O.S.No.290/87   and   their

        contention   that   the   plaint   schedule   property   in

        O.S.No.358/94   is   not   capable   to   be   identified   was   not

        sufficient to infer that they were denying the plaint allegation


S.A. NOS.409, 410 & 411 OF 2002



                                               ::  9  ::


        therein that the plaint schedule property in O.S.No.358/94 is

        the decree schedule property in O.S.No.290/87.


                24.        The   appellants   in   A.S.No.39/2000   have

        contended   that   the   plaint   schedule   property   in

        O.S.No.358/94   was   not   identified   by   appointing   a

        commission in spite of   the definite contention disputing the

        identity   of   the   property   described   therein   and   in   that

        circumstance, the lower court was not justified in granting a

        decree   declaring   the   title   of   that   property   and   allowing   its

        recovery.   I have found  that the plaint  schedule  property in

        O.S.No.358/94   was   the   decree   schedule   property   in

        O.S.No.290/87  wherein  the   3rd  defendant  in  O.S.No.358/94

        was the 2nd defendant.  The 2nd defendant in O.S.No.290/87

        executed   Ext.B2   sale   deed   after   the   decree   therein   in

        respect of a portion of the decree schedule property therein

        and the appellants  in A.S.No.39/2000 are claiming title over

        that property through Ext.B2 executed by him.  In view of the

        finding that the plaint schedule property in O.S.No.358/1994

        is   the   plaint   schedule   property   in   O.S.No.290/1987   the

        appellants in A.S.No.39/2000 who are claiming under the 2nd

        defendant   in   O.S.No.290/1987   are   not   entitled   to   contend

        that the plaint schedule property in O.S.No.358/1994  is not

        identifiable..."




        13.     I   am   of   the   view   that   the   courts   below   have   properly


considered the pleadings and documentary and oral evidence in the case


and have adverted to the contentions raised by the parties and rendered


the decision correctly.  The well considered judgments of the courts below


do not call for any interference in the Second Appeals.


        The Second Appeals are devoid of merits and they are accordingly


dismissed.  No order as to costs.

                                                                              Judge

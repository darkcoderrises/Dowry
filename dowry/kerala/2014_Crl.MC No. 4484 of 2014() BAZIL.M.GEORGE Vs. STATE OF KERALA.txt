                     V.K.MOHANAN, J
             ===========================
                  Crl.M.C No.4484 of 2014
             ============================
             Dated this the 8th day of August, 2014

                           ORDER


     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioner, who is the accused in Crime No.1081 of

2013 of Peechi Police Station for the offences punishable

under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code with a prayer to

quash Annexure B final report and all further proceedings

in S.C No.1091/2013 on the files of Principal Assistance

Sessions Court, Thrissur, as the matter is settled out of

court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner had sexual intercourse with the 2nd respondent

without her consent on different dates from May 2013 to

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014               2



July, 2013 by giving a promise to enter into a valid contract

of marriage and thereafter, he had withdrawn from the

promise of marriage and thereby committed the aforesaid

offence. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter was

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute through

mediation talks and on 27.01.2014, the petitioner and the

2nd respondent got married as per Section 13 of the Special

Marriage Act before the Marriage Officer, as evidenced by

Annexure C. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings

in the above case is absolutely unwarranted, which will

adversely affect their matrimonial life.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014                3



on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

respondent, submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner, who is her husband and she

has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents

and materials produced along with the above petition. In

the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no

objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offence involved

in the above case is under Section 376 of the Scheduled

Indian Penal Code which is more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offence is involved, the real parties to the

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014                     4



dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for

the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant         has  no    further    grievance      against      the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
         and different from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of
         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and
         no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014                     5



         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
         and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
         footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc.
         or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
         private or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases,
         High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
         and continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
         would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
         case despite        full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court

has held as follows:-

                 "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes
         have been on considerable increase in recent times
         resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A and
         406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also
         against the relatives of the husband.      The question is
         when such matters are resolved either by the wife
         agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual
         settlement of other pending disputes for which both the
         sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for
         quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or
         complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406 of
         I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the sole
         ground that since the offences are non-compoundable
         under Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible
         for the court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or
         complaint.
                 8.  It is not in dispute that in the case on hand
         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under
         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the
         Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014                      6



          intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers,
          the parties concerned have amicably settled their
          differences   and   executed   a   compromise/settlement.
          Pursuant     thereto,  the   appellants  filed   the   said
          compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place
          the same on record and to drop the criminal proceedings
          against the appellants herein. It is also not in dispute
          that in additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by
          the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit
          stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal
          proceedings against the appellants and fully supported
          the contents of the settlement deed. It is the grievance of
          the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such
          prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe
          exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code
          only on the ground that the criminal proceedings relate to
          the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of
          IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."
                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to
          encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,
          particularly, when the same are on considerable increase.
          Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if they relate
          to matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied that the
          parties have settled the same amicably and without any
          pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends
          of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to
          the exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or
          the subsequent criminal proceedings.
                    13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
         disputes in recent times.      The institution of marriage
         occupies an important place and it has an important role
         to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be
         made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable
         them to settle down in life and live peacefully.      If the
         parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their
         disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting
         it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in
         the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less
         hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is
         trite to state that the power under Section 482 should be
         exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when
         the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record,
         that allowing the proceedings to continue would be an

Crl.M.C No.4484/2014                     7



         abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of
         justice require that the proceedings ought to be quashed."

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decisions are applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.                It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure B final report and all further proceedings in S.C

No.1091/2013 on the files of Principal Assistance Sessions

Court, Thrissur,

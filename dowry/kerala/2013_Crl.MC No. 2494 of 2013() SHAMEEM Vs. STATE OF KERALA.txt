                   Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 15th day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.2047 of 2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kattakada which is a case

instituted upon the police report [in Crime No.296 of 2012 of

Neyyardam Police Station] for the offences punishable under

Sections 498A and 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to call for the

records relating to C.C.No.2047 of 2012 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kattakada arising from Crime No.296 of

2012 of the Neyyardam police station as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the 1st

petitioner/1st   accused   married    the   3rd   respondent  on

26.12.2010 as per religious rites prevailing in the Muslim

Community      and   there   after  subjected    her  to  cruelty

demanding more dowry after having misappropriated the

dowry already given by the petitioners and there by committed

offence punishable under Section 498A and 34 IPC. Now the

case of the petitioners are that the matter is settled out of

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013          2

court.

           3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the third respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

           4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

           5. The learned counsel for the third respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

           6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.       The de

facto complainant who is the third respondent has sworn into

an affidavit dated 30.04.2013 and filed before this Court.

Annexure- A3 is the compromise petition. In the given facts

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013           3

and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

           7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Section 498A and 34 IPC

which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.      From the submission made by the counsel for the

third respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note that

the Honourable Apex Court,         in the decision reported in

Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi

and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-

                   "7.   It  is not  in dispute  that
            matrimonial    disputes have   been   on
            considerable   increase in recent  times

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013              4

            resulting in filing of complaints under
            Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only
            against the husband but also against the
            relatives of the husband. The question is
            when such matters are resolved either by
            the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
            home or by mutual settlement of other
            pending disputes for which both the sides
            approached the High Court and jointly
            prayed     for  quashing    of   the   criminal
            proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the
            wife under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C.,
            whether the prayer can be declined on the
            sole ground that since the offences are non-
            compoundable under Section 320 of the
            Code, it would be impermissible for the
            court to quash the criminal proceedings or
            FIR or complaint.
                   8. It is not in dispute that in the case
            on hand subsequent to the filing of the
            criminal complaint under Sections 498A and
            406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the
            Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help
            and intervention of family members, friends
            and well-wishers, the parties concerned
            have amicably settled their differences and
            executed        a     compromise/settlement.
            Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the
            said compromise before the Trial Court with
            a request to place the same on record and
            to drop the criminal proceedings against the
            appellants herein. It is also not in dispute
            that in additional to the mutual settlement
            arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife
            has also filed an affidavit stating that she
            did not wish to pursue the criminal
            proceedings against the appellants and fully
            supported the contents of the settlement
            deed. It is the grievance of the appellants
            that no only the Trial Court rejected such
            prayer of the parties but also the High

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013             5

            Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction
            under Section 482 of the Code only on the
            ground that the criminal proceedings relate
            to the offences punishable under Sections
            498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
            compoundable in nature."
                   "12. In our view, it is the duty of the
            Courts to    encourage genuine settlements
            of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when
            the same are on considerable increase.
            Even if the offences are non-compoundable,
            if they relate to matrimonial disputes and
            the Court is satisfied that the parties have
            settled the same amicably and without any
            pressure, we hold that for the purpose of
            securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the
            Code would not be a bar to the exercise of
            power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
            subsequent criminal proceedings.
                      13. There has been an outburst of
            matrimonial disputes in recent times. The
            institution   of   marriage     occupies    an
            important place and it has an important
            role to play in the society. Therefore, every
            effort should be made in the interest of the
            individuals in order to enable them to settle
            down in life and live peacefully.      If the
            parties ponder over their defaults and
            terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
            agreement instead of fighting it out in a
            Court of law, in order to do complete justice
            in the matrimonial matters, the Courts
            should be less hesitant in exercising its
            extraordinary jurisdiction.     It is trite to
            state that the power under Section 482
            should be exercised sparingly and with
            circumspection only when the Court is
            convinced, on the basis of material on
            record, that allowing the proceedings to
            continue would be an abuse of the process
            of the Court or that the ends of justice

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013          6

            require that the proceedings ought to be
            quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

           8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting

Crl.M.C.No.2494 of 2013         7

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A1 FIR         and Annexure-A2 Final Report and all

further     proceedings   pending against the  petitioners in

C.C.No.2047 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kattakada.

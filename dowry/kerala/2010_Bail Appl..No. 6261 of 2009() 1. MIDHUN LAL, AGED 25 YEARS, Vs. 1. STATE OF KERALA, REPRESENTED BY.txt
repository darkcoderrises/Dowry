                   .........................................
                      B.A. No. 6261 of 2009
                   ..........................................
            Dated this the 29th day of March, 2010.

                                  ORDER



      Petitioners who are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No.747 of

2009 of Trichur West Police Station for an offence punishable

under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, seek anticipatory

bail.

      2.    The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application.

      3.     Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of this

nature.   But at the same time,             I am inclined to permit the

petitioners to surrender before the Investigating Officer for the

purpose of interrogation and then to have their application for

bail  considered    by     the     Magistrate            having jurisdiction.

Accordingly,   the    petitioners        shall     surrender   before    the

investigating officer on 12-04-2010 or 13-04-2010 for the

purpose of interrogation and recovery of incriminating material,

if any.     The petitioners shall thereafter appear before the

Magistrate concerned and file an application for regular bail. On

being convinced that the petitioners have been interrogated by

B.A. No. 6261/2009

                                 -:2:-

the police, the Magistrate shall preferably on the same date on

which the application is filed, release the petitioners on bail on

each of them executing a bond for Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees twenty

five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

amount to the satisfaction of the Magistrate and subject to the

following conditions:-




            1.    The petitioners       shall report before the
            Investigating Officer between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on
            all Wednesdays.
            2. The petitioners shall make themselves available
            for interrogation including custodial interrogation as
            and when required by the Investigating Officer.
            3.    Petitioners shall not influence or intimidate the
            prosecution witnesses nor shall they attempt to
            tamper with the evidence for the prosecution.
            4.    Petitioners shall not commit any offence while
            on bail.
              5. If the petitioners commit breach of any of the
            above conditions, the bail granted to them shall be
            liable to be cancelled.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

      Dated this the 29th day of March, 2010.

                                              V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE.

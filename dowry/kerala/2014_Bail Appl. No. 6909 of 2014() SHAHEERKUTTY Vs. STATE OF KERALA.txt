                             V.K.MOHANAN, J
                   ===========================
                             B.A No.6909 of 2014
                   ============================
                Dated this the 25th day of September, 2014

                                   ORDER


      The petitioners are accused nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No.525/2014 of Ayiroor

Police Station and apprehending arrest in the above crime, they preffered this

application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2. The prosecution allegation is that the 1st accused married the de facto

complainant on 12.04.2012 and while she was residing in her matrimonial

home, she was subjected to harassment, both physically and mentally,

demanding more dowry and thus, according to the prosecution, the accused

have committed the offences punishable under Sections 420, 427 and 498A r/w

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the 1st petitioner

divorced the de facto complainant by pronouncing Annexure A3 talaq and the

present crime is registered though the entire liability is settled with the de facto

B.A No.6909 of 2014
                                       2

complainant and that too as part of the matrimonial dispute pending between the

1st petitioner and the de facto complainant.

       5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that there is

no specific allegation against the petitioners and the crime was registered on the

basis of general allegations raised in the complaint, which was received by the

police under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala.

       6.   I have carefully considered the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. The fact that

the police happened to register crime on receiving complaint from the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala under Section 156(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure itself shows that the petitioner has not approached the police

initially making any complaint against the petitioners.      In the light of the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioners, it appears that a

serious civil and matrimonial dispute is pending between the de facto

complainant and the petitioners. As there is no specific allegation against the

petitioners, in view of the submission made by the learned Public Prosecutor,

B.A No.6909 of 2014
                                       3

according to me, this petition can be allowed however, subject to conditions.

       In the result, this petition is allowed and accordingly, there will be a

direction that in the event of the arrest of the petitioners in Crime

No.525/2014 of Ayiroor Police Station, they shall be released on bail on

each of them executing separate bond for `35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five

Thousand Only) with two solvent sureties, each for like amount, to the

satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above crime and on the

following other conditions:


           i)      1st   petitioner   shall   report     before     the
                   Investigating Officer in the above crime on
                   alternate Sundays between 10 a.m and 11 a.m.

           ii)     Petitioners 2 and 3, who are accused nos. 2 and
                   3 in the above are directed to appear before the
                   Investigating Officer as and when required.

           iii)    1st petitioner shall surrender his passport, if
                   any, before the jurisdictional Magistrate at the
                   time of executing the bail bond and if he is not
                   the passport holder, he will file an affidavit to
                   that effect in the said court. If the 1st petitioner
                   requires his passport, he can approach the
                   concerned court for the release of the same and

                    in case such an application is filed, the trial
                    court or the jurisdictional Magistrate, as the
                    case may be, is free to consider the same on
                    merit and to pass appropriate orders, guided by
                    the decision of this Court reported in Ashok
                    Kumar v State of Kerala (2009(2) KLT712),
                    notwithstanding the above condition imposed
                    by this Court.

           iv)      Petitioners shall not tamper with the evidence
                    and try to influence any witnesses.

           v)       Petitioners   shall  not  interfere  with   the
                    investigation.

                     ==========================
                      B.A. No. 1223 of 2014
                ===================================
          Dated this the 24th day of February, 2014


                              ORDER

     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1546/2013 of

Pattambi police station. The offences alleged against him are

under Secs.307 and 498A IPC.

     2.    It is alleged that the petitioner subjected the defacto

complainant to physical and mental cruelty demanding dowry. It

is further alleged that on 27.12.2013 the petitioner poured

kerosene on the body of the defacto complainant and set her on

fire.  She suffered 40% burn injuries.        The petitioner was

arrested on 02.01.2014 and since then he has been judicial

custody.

     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

allegations are untrue. The investigation is at the initial stage.

At this stage, it is not conducive to grant bail to the petitioner.

Hence, taking note of the seriousness of the allegations, this

application is dismissed.

              -------------------------------------------------
                  Crl. M.C. No.2536 of 2014
             --------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 18th day of June, 2014


                               O R D E R


          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No.247/204 of Aranmula police

station to quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called 'the Code').

          2.   It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners were arrayed as accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime

No.247/2014 of Aranmula police station, which was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the 1st

respondent as the defacto-complainant, alleging offences

under Section 452, 323, 324, 294(b) read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.          Now the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of well-wishers

and friends. On account of the settlement, the original

relationship has been restored and no purpose will be

Crl. M.C.2536 of 2014
                                    2

served by proceeding with the case as well. The defacto-

complainant does not want to prosecute the petitioners on

account of the settlement. Since some of the offences

alleged are non-compoundable in nature, they could not file

the application for compounding before the court below.

Further, since it is in the crime stage, neither the police nor

the court will accept compounding at this stage as well. So

the petitioner has no other remedy, except to approach this

court, seeking the following relief:

            "For these and other grounds to be urged at the
      time of hearing it is most respectfully submitted that this
      Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash all further
      proceedings in Crime No.247/2014 of Aranmula police
      station, on the file of the JFMC, No.I, Pathanamthitta for
      offences under Section. 452, 323, 324, 294(b) r/w 34 of
      the I.P.C".

            3.     First respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and he does not want to prosecute the

petitioners and the settlement itself was arrayed at due to

the intervention of well-wishers of both parties. Further he

had filed affidavit stating these facts as well.

            4.     The counsel for the petitioner also submitted

Crl. M.C.2536 of 2014
                                 3

that, in view of the settlement, there is no possibility of

conviction, so he prayed for allowing the application.

            5.     The    learned   Public     Prosecutor,   on

instructions as directed by this Court,         submitted that,

except this case, there is no other case against the

petitioners but opposed the application on the ground that

petitioners 2 to 4 are juvenile and the case against them

was split up and final report was filed before the Juvenile

Justice Board, Pathanamthitta, and as against for first

petitioner final report was filed before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta.

            6.     It is an admitted fact that, petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No. 247/2014 of

Aranmula police station, which was registered on the basis

of the statement given by the 1st respondent against the

petitioners alleging offences under Section 452, 323, 324,

294(b) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It is

also gathered from the submissions of the learned Public

Prosecutor and also report obtained from Judicial First

Crl. M.C.2536 of 2014
                                   4

Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta,                that since

petitioners 2 to 4 were juveniles, case against them was

split up and split charge sheet was filed before the Juvenile

Justice Board, Pathanamthitta, and final report against first

petitioner was filed before that court on 10.06.2014. It is

also seen from the affidavit that, the parties are known to

each other and on account of the settlement their old

relationship has been restored. On account of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction and

proceeding of the case will only amount to wastage of

judicial time. Further, it cannot be said to be an incident of

public interest as well, as it is a private dispute between

neighbors resulted in registration of crime and filing of final

report, in which juveniles also involved.

            7.     Further in the decision reported in Gian

Singh V. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal

Crl. M.C.2536 of 2014
                                   5

      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise

Crl. M.C.2536 of 2014
                                    6

      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, a private

dispute has been resulted in registration of crime and filing

of final report and petitioners 2 to 4 were juveniles and due

to the intervention of mediators and well-wishers, the entire

dispute between the parties have been settled and original

relationship has been restored and the possibility of

conviction will be remote in view of the settlement, this

court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote

settlement which resulted in harmony between the parties

and pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the

same.

            So this criminal, miscellaneous case is allowed

and further proceedings in Crime No.274/2014 of Aranmula

                                 7

police station, which is now pending, (after filing of the final

report) before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Pathanamthitta and Juvenile Justice Board, Pathanamthitta,

as against the petitioners are hereby quashed.

            Office is directed to communicate this order to

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta

and also to the Juvenile Justice Board, Pathanamthitta, for

necessary further action in this regard.

                        BA No.6653 of 2012-B
             ----------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 18th day of September 2012

                                   Order


           This petition is filed under Section 438 of Cr.PC.,

seeking anticipatory bail. The petitioners are the first and

second accused in Crime No.827/12 of Valapad Police Station

for having committed the offences punishable under Sections

406, 420 r/w 34 IPC. The first petitioner is the husband and the

second    petitioner,      the     mother-in-law         of    the defacto

complainant. The marriage between the first petitioner and the

defacto complainant was solemnized on 7.10.2010 and they

have a child in the wedlock.               The allegation against the

petitioners is that they committed matrimonial cruelty to the

defacto complainant both mentally and physically, demanding

more dowry.       The petitioners submit that the first petitioner is

working abroad and the defacto complainant used to stay at

her parental house and even when he comes from abroad, she

refused to come to the matrimonial house and so, he caused to

issue a lawyer notice to the complainant for restitution of

BA 6653/12                          2

conjugal rights and as a consequence of this, the present

complaint has been filed. The petitioners point out that they are

totally innocent and have been implicated with ulterior motives.

Therefore, they seek anticipatory bail.

            2. The learned Public prosecutor vehemently

opposed the application.

            3. Having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and going

through the records made available before this court, it is felt

that this is a fit case warranting exercise of the extra ordinary

jurisdiction of this court under Section 438 of Cr.PC.

Accordingly, this application is allowed as follows :

1. The petitioners shall surrender before the Investigating

   Officer on or before 26.09.12, who, after interrogation, shall

   produce them before the JFCM concerned.

2. On applications being filed by the petitioners for bail before

   the JFCM concerned, they shall be released on bail on each

   of them executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen

   Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum

   each to the satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

BA 6653/12                          3

3. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

   sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts produced by

   the sureties before granting bail to the petitioners.

4. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer

   as and when required by him, till final report is filed.

5. The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

6. If any of the conditions is violated by any of the petitioners,

   the bail granted in respect of the said petitioner shall stand

   cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied of the

   said fact, may take such proceedings as are available to him

   in law.

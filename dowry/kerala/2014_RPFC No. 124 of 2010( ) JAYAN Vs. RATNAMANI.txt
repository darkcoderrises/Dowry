                    R.P(FC) No.124 of 2010
                    ---------------------------------------
                Dated this the 19th day of March, 2014


                         O R D E R



           The revision petitioner herein challenges the order

of the Family Court, Palakkad in M.C.No.4/2009 dated

5.10.2009, directing him to pay maintenance to his wife at the

rate of 2,000/- per month. She was married by the revision

petitioner on 26.5.2002. But the matrimony did not last long.

It is alleged that she was driven out from the matrimonial

home on 27.8.2002 and that she had been mentally harassed

by demanding more dowry.           When the revision petitioner

deserted her and neglected to maintain her for about seven

years, the wife preferred a claim for maintenance under

Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

           2.   The respondent entered appearance and

resisted the claim on the contention that the matrimony

strained only due to the indifferent attitude of the wife, that

she has been residing separately without any just excuse, and

that he is not in a position to pay that much amount claimed

by the wife.

           3.   The trial court conducted an enquiry in the

proceedings, and evidence was recorded. The wife examined

R.P(FC) No.124 of 2010            2


herself as PW1 and the husband examined himself as RW1.

On an appreciation of evidence the trial court found that the

wife is entitled to get separate maintenance, and that the

revision petitioner who is admittedly a carpenter has sufficient

means to pay maintenance at the rate of 2,000/- per month.

Accordingly, the revision petitioner was directed to pay

maintenance to his wife at the rate of 2,000/- per month.

             4.     On hearing both sides, I find that the dispute

in this revision is practically regarding the quantum of

maintenance awarded by the trial court. It was submitted

that the revision petitioner had filed an application for

divorce, and the matter is now pending in appeal on dismissal

of the petition for divorce. This is a clear case of neglect to

maintain the wife. The revision petitioner has no explanation

why he did not make payment of maintenance to his wife for

the last seven years. Of course he could not take back his wife

because he wants divorce. It is true that a prosecution under

Section 498A IPC ended in acquittal. That will not preclude

her from claiming maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C.

Mere neglect to maintain will entitle the wife to claim

maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. I do not find any

reason for interference in the findings of the trial court

R.P(FC) No.124 of 2010           3


regarding the right of the respondent to get maintenance form

the revision petitioner. Admittedly, the revision petitioner is a

Carpenter. But his contention is that he would not get that

much income as alleged by his wife. The Court will have to

consider the needs and necessities of a wife aged 35 years,

and will also have to consider the present days cost of living.

We are now in 2014 where the cost of living is on high scale.

It is unbelievable that a Carpenter cannot afford to pay

maintenance to his wife at the rate of 2,000/- per month.

There is nothing to show that his wife has any income from

any source. I find that the amount of maintenance granted by

the trial court is quite reasonable and it does not require any

interference in revision. This revision petition is accordingly

liable to be dismissed. However, the parties can bear their

respective cost.

             In the result, the Criminal Revision Petition is

dismissed.

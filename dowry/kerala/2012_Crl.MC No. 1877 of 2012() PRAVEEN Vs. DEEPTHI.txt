               Crl.M.C. NO. 1877 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 23rd day of November, 2012

                           ORDER


           Petitioners are the accused in a pending case on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Ernakulam.

They are being prosecuted for offences punishable under

Sections 498(A), 341 and 323 read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. Crime in the above case was registered

on the complaint of the first respondent, the wife of the first

petitioner, alleging matrimonial cruelty and harassment by

her   husband     and   his   relatives  demanding      dowry.

Investigation of that crime has led to indictment of the

petitioners/accused for the offences stated supra. Spouses

have resolved their matrimonial disputes and they have

severed their relationship by a decree passed by the Family

Court on a joint application moved by them seeking

dissolution of their marriage, is the submission of the counsel

for petitioners. A copy of the order passed by the Family

Crl.M.C. NO. 1877 of 2012       2



Court, Ernakulam, on the joint application filed by the

spouses for dissolving their marriage has been produced.

Learned counsel for the first respondent submits that she is

no longer interested in prosecuting the petitioners/accused in

view of the settlement effected by the parties. Having regard

to the fact that the case has arisen from the matrimonial

disputes of the spouses, and such disputes have been

settled, I find continuation of the criminal proceedings

against the petitioners is not called for. The Apex Court in

Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)

has held that in criminal cases even involving non

compoundable        offences  where     the    disputes   are

predominantly of civil nature or arise from matrimonial

disputes invoking inherent powers of the court proceedings

thereof could be quashed recognizing the settlement effected

by the parties treating such disputes as personal to them.

Taking note of the above decision and also the facts and

circumstances of the case, the criminal proceedings against

the petitioners in C.C. No.288 of 2010 on the file Judicial

Crl.M.C. NO. 1877 of 2012         3



First Class Magistrate-I, Ernakulam, are quashed under

Section 482 of the Code.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

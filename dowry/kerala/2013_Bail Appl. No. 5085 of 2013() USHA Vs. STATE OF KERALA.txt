                     B.A.No.5085 OF 2013 ()
                     --------------------------------
               Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2013

                              O R D E R
                              ~~~~~~~

      Petitioners are two among the accused (A2 and A3) in Crime

No.766 of 2013 of Yeroor Police Station registered for offence

punishable under Section 498A read with 34 of Indian Penal Code.

Petitioners seek pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code').

      2.    First accused in the crime is the son of petitioners. The

above crime was registered on a complaint by the wife of first

accused alleging matrimonial cruelty demanding dowry by her

husband and his parents, petitioners. Complaint referred to police

for investigation and report has led to registration of the above

crime for the offence stated supra. Crime is now under

investigation.

      3.    First accused in the crime is presently employed in a

gulf country. Allegations imputed against petitioners are not true

to facts, is the submission of their counsel to urge for granting

them anticipatory bail.     Case diary has been produced for my

perusal by learned Public Prosecutor. On going through the

materials covered by case diary, particularly, complaint filed by

de facto complainant, I find arrest and custodial interrogation of

B.A.No.5085/2013                 2

petitioners may not be essential for a fair investigation of the

crime. Previously, on the complaint of de facto complainant, a

crime had been registered for similar offence and, later, it is seen,

spouses resolving the matrimonial disputes cohabitated together

giving a quietus to that crime. Subsequently, after first accused

left for gulf country, he has not provided maintenance to de facto

complainant and her child, and also, there was demand for dowry,

is the allegation imputed to proceed against the accused for the

offence stated supra.

      In the circumstances indicated, petitioners (A2 and A3 in the

crime) are granted anticipatory bail with direction to co-operate

with the investigation of crime. If their presence is demanded by

the investigating officer, they shall report before him, till

completion of investigation of crime. Petitioner shall not leave the

State for a period of six months or till completion of investigation

of crime without getting prior permission from the investigating

officer in writing.

      Petition is allowed.                         Sd/-

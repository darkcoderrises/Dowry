                    B.A.No.5795 of 2014
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of August, 2014

                            ORDER


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.584 of 2014 of the

Vithura Police station and apprehending arrest they preferred

the above application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, seeking Anticipatory Bail.

     2.    The prosecution allegation is that the 1st accused

brought the de facto complainant from her home on 08.01.2009

and had married her on 08.08.201 and while living as husband

and wife the accused mentally and physically harassed the de

facto   complainant     by     demanding       dowry   and    by

misappropriating the gold ornaments and money given to the

de facto complainant by her parents and thereby the accused

has committed the offences punishable under Sections 498A,

323, 406 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Heard the counsel for the petitioners and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

     4.     Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

the de facto complainant and the first accused/first petitioner

wherein love and they eloped on 08.01.2009 and subsequently

B.A.No.5795 of 2014
                                2

their marriage was solemnized after three years on 08.08.2012

and while they were living as husband and wife, there occurred

some difference of opinion consequently the first petitioner/first

accused filed O.P.(HMA).No.391 of 2014 for divorce before the

Family Court, Nedumangadu. Thereafter, the second petitioner

has also filed a complaint against the Sub Inspector of Police,

Vithura against the harassment meted out by the Sub Inspector

of Police demanding to withdraw the divorce of the petition

filed by the first petitioner. Thereafter, the de facto

complainant     preferred   a   complaint     and  consequently

Annexure-I crime was registered. So according to the learned

counsel the criminal case was now launched connected with

the matrimonial dispute between the first petitioner and the de

facto complainant.

      5.   Learned Public Prosecutor on instruction submitted

that except the general allegation there is no specific overt act

alleged against the petitioners.

      6.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved the case, I am of the view that this petition can be

disposed of granting relief as sought for.

      In the result, the above petition is allowed and there will

be a direction that, in event of the arrest of the petitioners

B.A.No.5795 of 2014
                                 3

connected with Crime No.584 of 2014 of the Vithura Police

station, they shall be released on bail on each of them

executing a bond for Rs.35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand

only) with two solvent sureties each for like amount to the

satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above crime and

on the following further conditions:

      (a)  The    first  petitioner  shall   report   before the

Investigating Officer in Crime No.584 of 2014 of the Vithura

Police station between 10.00 a.m and 11.00 a.m. on every

Second Saturday. The petitioners 2 and 3 shall report before

the Investigating Officer as and when required.

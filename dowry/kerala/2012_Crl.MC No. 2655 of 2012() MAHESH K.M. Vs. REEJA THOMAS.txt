                      Crl.M.C No.2655 OF 2012
            -------------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 15th day of October, 2012


                                  ORDER



      Petitioners are the accused in a case awaiting trial before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly.             They are being

prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 498A r/w

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Crime in the above case was

registered on a complaint given by the first respondent, wife of the

first accused. Learned counsel for the petitioners adverting to the

First Information Statement and also the final report, and other

materials accompanying thereof, which are produced as annexures

in the petition, contended that no case has been made out to

proceed against any of the petitioners for the offence under Section

498A Indian Penal Code.          The allegations, at best, would only

indicate that the petitioners inflicted cruelty or harassment on the

de facto complainant, wife of the first petitioner.              There is no

allegation that the cruelty inflicted on her would have driven her to

commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or

health, necessary, to constitute an offence under Section 498A

Clause A of the Indian Penal Code. Similarly, there is no case that

Crl.M.C No.2655/2012               2




any harassment had been inflicted to coerce her to satisfy any

demand for dowry.          As such, continuation of the criminal

proceedings against the petitioners on the allegations imputed is

nothing but an abuse of process of the court, is the submission of

the counsel. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the

first respondent adverting to the statements made in the petition

contended that even the petitioners have practically conceded

that she had threatened to commit suicide, but, advancing a case

that she has the tendency to make such threats on simple issues.

Cruelty and harassment inflicted are of such a nature that would

have driven any woman to commit suicide, is the submission of

the counsel to contend that even if the materials produced by the

police as such do not spelt out that the infliction of cruelty would

have driven the victim to commit suicide or danger to her life or

limb or health, still, that is a matter to be considered and decided

after recording the evidence in the case.



       2. After framing of the charge, the case now awaits trial, is

the further submission of the counsel. After hearing the counsel

Crl.M.C No.2655/2012               3




on both sides, I find, at this stage, invoking of the inherent powers

of this court to quash the criminal proceedings against the

petitioners is not to be resorted to solely for the reason that the

records produced by the police do not establish the essential

ingredients for the offence imputed. Whatever defence available

to the petitioner, no doubt, can be canvassed by them before the

magistrate. Allegations imputed by the de facto complainant had

given rise to indictment of the petitioners for the offence under

Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, after investigation by police.

Magistrate being satisfied from the records produced has framed

charges against accused, and the case awaits trial. At this stage

scrutiny of materials to decide whether there is sufficient material

to sustain the indictment, by this court is not called for.



      Petition is dismissed.

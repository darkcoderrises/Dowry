                    ----------------------------------------
                       Crl.M.C.No. 4258 of 2009
                    ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 21st day of June, 2013

                                 O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 8 in C.P.No.61 of 2009 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha          for the offences

punishable under Sections 307,326,327,506(II) of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure A1 complaint in C.P.No.61 of 2009 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha. Now, the case

of the petitioners is that the dispute between the petitioners herein and

the complainant is settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that the second

respondent preferred a complaint to the Alappuzha North Police

Station alleging that on 8.10.2007 at about 8.30 a.m., the accused

trespassed into his compound with dangerous weapons and destroyed

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                 :-2-:

the plants and also alleged that the first accused had inflicted an injury

over the head portion of the complainant with a sword and seventh

accused had inflicted injury on him.         On the basis of the above

information, Crime No.533 of 2007 was registered in the Alappuha

North Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

324,447,427 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. and on taking cognizance

upon such report, C.C.No.204 of 2008 was instituted in the trial court

viz., the court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Alappuzha. The Police report therein is produced along with Crl.M.C.

as Annexure A3. While the above charge was pending, the second

respondent herein preferred a private complaint/protest complaint in

the very same court and the learned Magistrate, after conducting the

enquiry, took cognizance for the offences punishable under Sections

307,326,327 and 506(II) I.P.C. and thus          C.P.No.61 of 2009 is

instituted.   Thus, the above M.C. is filed with a prayer to quash

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                  :-3-:

Annexure A1 complaint upon which C.P.No.61 of 2009 was instituted.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

learned counsel appearing for the second respondent.

         4. Both the counsel are unanimous in their submission that

during the pendency of the above Crl.M.C. before this Court, the

matter has been settled out of court, especially when the second

petitioner, who is the second accused in the above C.P. is the brother

of the second respondent herein/the complainant. The learned counsel

appearing for the second respondent submitted that in the above M.C.,

the second respondent has filed Crl.M.A.No.2700 of 2013 producing

certain affidavits including that of the second respondent and other

injured. The above petition was filed to accept the above affidavits in

the above M.C. which was allowed by this Court. Thus, on a perusal

of the above affidavits, it is seen that the matter is settled out of court

and the de facto complainant and the other injured have no further

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                       :-4-:

grievance against the petitioners herein and they are not proposed to

proceed with the prosecution against the petitioners/accused. As the

petitioners and the de facto complainant and the injured are

neighbours, according to me, it is only just and proper to quash the

proceedings pending against the petitioners so as to continue the

harmony now arrived between the parties to the dispute.

         5. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                             :-5-:

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                   :-6-:

         6.     According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of

this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -

Crl.M.C.No.4258 of 2009


                                :-7-:

A1 complaint in C.P.No.61/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha and all further proceedings thereto

including the proceedings in the above committal proceedings.

                Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                -------------------------------
        Dated this the 25th day of August, 2014.


                        O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in

S.C.No.163 of 2013 of the Principal Assistant Sessions

court, Kollam, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.1229 of 2011 of Eravipuram Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 143,

147, 148, 452, 324, 326, 307 r/w 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure 2 final report in the above crime and all

further proceedings pursuant to the same including the

above sessions case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2. The allegation in the above case is that, due to

previous animosity towards the son of the de facto

complainant, the petitioners/accused entered into the

Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                               2

house of the de facto complainant, in search of the son of

respondents 1 and 2, believing that he is an SFI worker and

the petitioners hit the de facto complainant and his wife

with a lamp on their head and sustained injuries, and

thereby     committed    the offence as    alleged   by  the

prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st and 2nd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute, which is the subject matter of the above case, as

per Annexures 3 and 4 affidavits sworn into by the 1st and

2nd respondents respectively. Therefore, the continuation

of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of

law and proceedings.

         5.      The learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd

Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                                3

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the victim and the de facto

complainant, do not intends to proceed any further against

the petitioner and they have no grievance against him.

         6.        I  have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 143,

147, 148, 452, 324, 326, 307 r/w 149 of I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences

Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                                    4

are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st and 2nd

respondents, it appears to me that the victim and the de

facto complainant have no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                                   5

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

Crl.M.C.No.4545 of 2014
                              6

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.       Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure 2 final report in Crime No.1229 of 2011 of

Eravipuram Police Station and all further proceedings

pursuant to the same including in S.C.No.163 of 2013 of

the Principal Assistant Sessions court, Kollam.

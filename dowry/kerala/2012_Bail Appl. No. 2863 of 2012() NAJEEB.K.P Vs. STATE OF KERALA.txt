                N.K.BALAKRISHNAN, J.
              ==================

                  B.A.No. 2863 of 2012

        =========================
         Dated this the 31st day of May, 2012

                         ORDER


     Petitioner is the husband of the defacto complainant.

The complainant was married by the accused about nine

years ago. Two children wee born in that wedlock. It is

alleged that the accused continuously harassed the

complainant by demanding more dowry by way of gold or

money. It was also stated that she was not allowed to go

to her parental house nor did the petitioner allow her

parents to come to the matrimonial house. It is because of

the intolerable cruelty she was subjected to, she

consumed poison to commit suicide. Her life was some

how saved.

     2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

the complainant was having some psychic disorder or

such ailments. No document was produced to probablise

B.A.No.2863/2012
                             : 2 :


that version. Though it was stated that the complainant

attempted to commit suicide on an earlier occasion also

for that there is no material.

            Considering the gravity of the offences, I am

not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner.

Hence, it is dismissed.

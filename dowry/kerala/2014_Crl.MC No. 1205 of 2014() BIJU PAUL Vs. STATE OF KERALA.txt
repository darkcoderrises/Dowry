                         Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 18th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is to quash the

proceedings as against the petitioner in Crime No.323/2004

of Kunnathunadu, Police Station, after recording the

composition entered into between him and the 2nd

respondent under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the 5th accused in the above crime, which was

registered on the basis of the statement given by CW1,

against the petitioner and others alleging offences under

Section 143, 147, 148, 447, 323, 326 and Section 149 of

Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed

and it was taken on the file as C.C.No.102/2005 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery, and the

final report so filed is Annexure-AI. In that case, accused

Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
                                   2

Nos.1 to 4 and 6 alone appeared earlier and they faced trial

and as per Annexure-AII judgment, they were acquitted by

that court, on the ground that even PW1 was not able to

identify the accused persons, as to who had inflicted injuries

on him. The case against the present peitoner and the 7th

accused was split up and re-field as C.C.No.753/2009.

Thereafter the 7th accused filed Criminal M.C.No.2828/2009

before this court and this court by Annexure-III order

quashed the proceedings as against the 7th accused. Only

remaining accused in the case is the present petitioner. He

has also now settled the dispute with the defacto-

complainant. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature, they could not file compounding

application before the court below.          So he has no other

option except to approach this court under Section 482 of

the 'Code' for quashing the proceedings. Hence this petition

is filed, seeking following reliefs:

      "1. Call for the records leading Annexure-I charge and to

Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
                                  3

      quash the same by relying on Annexure-II so as to secure
      ends of justice.

      2. Issue such other order or direction as may be
      necessary on the facts and circumstances of the case."



            3.     The 2nd respondent, who is the defacto-

complainant appeared though counsel and submitted that,

the matter has been settled between the parties and the

defacto-complainant has no grievance against the petitioner

now and they are living in cordial terms and he has also

filed an affidavit to that effect before this court.

            4.     On instructions, learned Public Prosecutor

submitted that except this case the petitioner has not

involved in any other crimes and he has no criminal

background. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served in

keeping the case as against the petitioner.

            5.     Heard both sides.

            6.     It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by CW1, the police has registered a case as

Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
                                4

Crime No.323/2004 of Kunnathunadu police station, against

the present petitioner and others, alleging offences under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 323 and 326 read with Section

149 of the Indian Penal Code.       After investigation, the

investigating officer submitted Annexure-AI final report

against the 7 accused persons, including the present

petitioner.     Accused Nos.1 to 4 and 6 earlier appeared,

when the case was taken on the file as C.C.No.102/2005 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kolenchery, and faced trial and that was ended in acquittal

as per Annexure-II judgment. It is seen from the judgment

that, even the defacto-complainant was not able to identify

any of the assailant's, as the person who inflicted the injury

on him and it was on that ground that the case was ended in

acquittal as regards those accused persons. The case

against the present petitioner and the 7th accused was split

up and re-filed as C.C.No.753/2009. Thereafter the 7th

accused        moved      this court  by   filing    criminal

Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
                                    5

M.C.No.2828/2009, after settling the case with the defacto-

complainant and on the basis of further investigation, it was

revealed that, he was not involved in the commission of the

crime, this court by Annexure-III order allowed the

application and quashed the proceedings as against him.

Now the only accused left out was the present petitioner.

He has also now settled the dispute with the 2nd respondent.

            7.     The    2nd  respondent      filed    an   affidavit,

admitting the settlement and expressing his willingness to

quash the proceedings as against the petitioner. Since the

case against the other accused persons have been ended in

acquittal for want of evidence and also on the basis of the

settlement, there is no purpose in keeping this case also.

Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has held that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be

Crl. M. C. No.1205 of 2014
                                       6

      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

                                      7

      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




             8.     In view of the dictum laid down in Gian

Singh's       case     (supra),      and     also    considering     the

circumstances that, other accused persons have been

acquitted on the ground of non-identification and the case

against the 7th accused was quashed by this court and the

present petitioner also settled the case with the 2nd

respondent and they are living in harmony, I feel that, it is a

fit case where the power under Section 482 of the 'Code'

can be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote

harmony between the parties and also considering the fact

that, in view of the settlement, there is no possibility of

conviction arises in this case as well. So the application is

allowed       and     the     case    against     the    petitioner   in

C.C.No.753/2009 (in Crime No.323/2004 of Kunnathunadu

police Station) on the file of the Judicial First Class

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court,

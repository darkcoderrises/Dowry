    ==============================
                   Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014
    ==============================
          Dated this, the 29th day of May, 2014.




                            O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos.1 and 6 in C.C.No.194/2009 pending before

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur to quash the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2.     It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused in C.C.No.194/2009 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. The above case was originated

on the basis of Crime No.215/2009 of Vadakkenchery Police

Station which was registered on the basis of the statement

given by the third respondent against the petitioners alleging

commission of offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

294(b), 323, 324 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, final report was filed and the case was

taken on file as C.C.No.194/2009 and pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. In the meantime,

the matter has been settled between the petitioners and the

Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014       : 2 :

third respondent.       In fact, the petitioners and the third

respondent are neighbours and the matter has been settled

due to the intervention of mediators and well wishers of both

parties and on account of the settlement, their relationship has

been restored. No purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case in view of the settlement. Since some of the offences

are non-compoundable in nature, they have no have no other

option except to approach this court seeking the following

relief:

            "To pass an order to quash Annexure-II Final

      Report and all further proceedings against the

      petitioners/Accused in C C No.194/2009 on the files

      of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur."



      3.     Third respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and the third respondent has no grievance against the

petitioners now and he does not want to prosecute the case

and he filed an affidavit stating these facts.

      4.     The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that

in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served in keeping

the case. So, he prayed for allowing the application.

Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014    :  3 :

      5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners but opposed the application on the

ground grave offences have been incorporated.

      6.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the third respondent, Annexure I crime

was registered as Crime No.215/2009 of Vadakkenchery Police

Station of Palakkad District against the petitioners alleging

commission of the offences under Sections 143, 147, 148,

341, 294(b), 323, 324 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal

Code.     It is also an admitted fact that after investigation,

Annexure II Final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.194/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Alathur and the case is now pending before

that court. Now, the parties have settled the dispute and the

de facto complainant filed an affidavit stating these facts and

he does not want to prosecute the case. It is also seen from

the allegations that the parties are neighbours and on account

of the intervention of mediators and well wishers of both

parties, the dispute between them has been settled and the

relationship has been restored.    It cannot be said to be an

Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014          :   4 :

incident of public interest. In view of the settlement, there is

no possibility of conviction even if the case is allowed to

proceed as neither the de facto complainant nor his witnesses

will support the case of the prosecution.

      7.      Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

              "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed.       However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard
      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious
      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the
      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial,  mercantile,   civil,  partnership   or  such   like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is
      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014          :   5 :

      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
      settlement    and   compromise     between    the  victim  and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer
      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall
      be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."



      8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case in view of the settlement and

conviction in such cases will be remote and relationship has

been restored on account of the settlement, this court feels

that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code

of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings

in order to promote the settlement and harmony that has been

restored on account of the settlement.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.194/2009 (Crime No.215/09 of Vadakkenchery Police

Station of Palakkad District) pending before Judicial First Class

Crl.M.C.No.2159 of 2014    : 6 :

Magistrate Court, Alathur as against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary further action.

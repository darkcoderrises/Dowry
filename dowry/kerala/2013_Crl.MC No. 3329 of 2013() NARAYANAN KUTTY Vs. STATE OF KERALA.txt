                 Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
        Dated this the 12th day of August, 2013

                          O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in C.C.No.353/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nedumangadu which is a

case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 294(b) of I.P.C., with a prayer

to quash all proceeding in C.C.No.353 of 2012 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court for trial of Forest

offences, Nedumangadu as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The sum and substance of the allegation of the

prosecution is that on 16/11/2011 at 3.30 p.m., the

petitioner/accused trespassed in the shop room of the defacto

complainant, wrongfully restrained the defacto complainant

due to the enmity of plastering the southern side of the

defacto complainant's shop room and also due to the demand

of the defacto complainant to the petitioner/accused to shift

the septic tank constructed by the accused in front of the shop

rooms of the defacto complainant. The defacto complainant

Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
                               2

further alleged that, due to the dismantling of plastering in the

southern side of defacto complainant's shop room by the

accused caused a loss of Rs.15,000/- to the defacto

complainant. Thus, according to the prosecution, the accused

has committed the offences punishable under Sections 341,

294(b) of I.P.C. Now, the case of the petitioner is that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled between

himself and the second respondent, who is the defacto

complainant. The second respondent, defacto complainant had

sworn into Annexure-C affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5.  The learned counsel for the second      respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received      from the

Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
                                3

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 341, 294(b) of I.P.C.,

which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

second     respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
                                    4

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
                                     5

         or such like transactions or the offences arising out

         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

Crl.M.C.No.3329 of 2013
                                6

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.

353/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Nedumangadu and all further proceedings thereto.

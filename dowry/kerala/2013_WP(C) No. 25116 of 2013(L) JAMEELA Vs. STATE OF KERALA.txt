              ---------------------------------------
                  W.P.C. No.25116 OF 2013
              ---------------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of October, 2013.

                          JUDGMENT

      The petitioner is the daughter of a convict, who is

undergoing imprisonment in respect of the proven offence under

Sections 498(A) and 304(b) of the Indian Penal Code. The father

of the petitioner is a septuagenarian, who is suffering from

various ailments. The case registered against the accused was

that, he demanded balance dowry of about Rs.7,000/- (Rupees

Seven thousand only), which led to suicide committed by the

daughter-in-law of the said convict (sister-in-law of the

petitioner).

      2. The case of the petitioner is that, the verdict passed by

the Trial Court has become final, by virtue of the dismissal of the

Appeal and the Revision Petition. The present cause of action is in

respect of the lapse on the part of the concerned respondent in

considering Ext.P5 application preferred under Section 432

Cr.P.C. The prayer is only to cause the same to be considered

W.P.C.No.25116 of 2013            2




and disposed of within a reasonable time.

      3. Heard the learned Government Pleader as well, who

submits that the scope of interference, especially the power to be

exercised by the Government, is only to be a limited extent,

more so, in view of the law declared by the Apex Court in

Muhinder Sing Vs. State of Punjab [2013 (1) KLT SN 93

(Case No.79)].

      4. After hearing both the sides, the writ petition is disposed

of, directing the 2nd respondent to consider Ext.P5 and pass

appropriate orders thereon, in accordance with law, at the

earliest, at any rate, within 'three months' from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment.

      Petitioner shall produce a copy of this judgment, along with

a copy of this writ petition, before the 2nd respondent, for further

steps.


                                 P.R. RAMACHANDRA MENON,
                                              JUDGE

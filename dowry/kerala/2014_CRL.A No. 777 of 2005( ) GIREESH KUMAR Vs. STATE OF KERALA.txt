              ---------------------------------------
                 Crl. Appeal No.777 OF 2005
              ---------------------------------------
          Dated this the 2nd day of January, 2014.


                        J U D G M E N T


     The 1st accused, who is the husband of the deceased

Shylaja, and his parents were prosecuted for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A, 406, 315, 323, 324, 294(b),

506(II), 120B read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The 2nd

and 3rd accused were acquitted of all charges. The 1st accused

was found guilty of the offences punishable under Sections 498A

and 323 IPC. He was convicted and sentenced to suffer rigorous

imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of

Rs.5,000/- with default clause of simple imprisonment for a

further period of three months under Section 498A IPC and also

sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of three

months under Section 323 IPC. Set off as per law was allowed.

     2. The marriage between the 1st accused and the deceased

Shylaja was conducted on 27.07.1995.         The couple had two

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005              2


children in the wedlock. The allegation is that soon after the

marriage, the accused began to ill-treat Shylaja complaining of

inadequacy of dowry and lack of beauty and it is alleged that she

was manhandled and assaulted by the accused persons. It is

also alleged that while she was carrying for the third occasion,

the 1st accused kicked her and as a result of which she fell down

and had bleeding.          She was taken to hospital where PW6

attended to her and she furnished Ext.P4 certificate. It is seen

that the deceased Shylaja laid a private complaint on 24.05.1999

complaining of the ill-treatment by the accused persons which

was forwarded by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court

concerned for investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.       On

receipt of Ext.P1 complaint, PW7 registered a crime as per Ext.P5

First Information Report.

       3.     Investigation was taken over by PW9.     He prepared

Ext.P2 scene mahazar and recorded the statement of a few

witnesses.         Subsequent investigation was conducted by PW10

and finally PW8 laid charge before court.

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005           3


       4.      The court before which final report was laid took

cognizance of the offences and on finding that the offences are

exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions, the case was

committed to Sessions Court, Kozhikode. The said court made

over the case to Additional District and Sessions Court, Fast

Track (Adhoc-I), Kozhikode for trial and disposal.      The latter

court, on receipt of records, framed charges for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A, 406, 315, 323, 324, 294(b),

506(II), 120B read with Section 34 IPC.       To the charge, the

accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.            The

prosecution therefore had PWs 1 to 11 examined and Exts.P1 to

P6 marked. The defence had Ext.D1 marked through PW1.

       5. On an appreciation of the evidence in the case, trial

court came to the conclusion that there are materials to show the

acts committed by the 1st accused and therefore, he was

convicted and sentenced as already mentioned. The 2nd and 3rd

accused were acquitted of all charges.

       6. Assailing the conviction and sentence of the 1st accused,

learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005            4


court below has not properly considered Ext.D1 agreement which

would show that even if there was any disharmony in the marital

life of the victim, that was patched up and the couple had taken

up residence together and till 07.12.2002 when Shylaja died,

they were residing together. Any act of ill-treatment had been

condoned as going by Ext.D1 and after Ext.D1, nothing survived

for consideration. Learned counsel went on to point out that the

reliance placed by the court below on the evidence of PWs 1 and

2 cannot be justified in the sense that they have only hearsay

knowledge about the incidents even though they claimed to have

direct knowledge about one or two incidents.

       7.     It is true, according to the learned counsel for the

appellant, that PWs 1 and 2 do say that they had taken Shylaja

to hospital when they reached the place hearing her cries. These

aspects are prior to the execution of Ext.D1 which is an admitted

document which would show that if at all there was any ill-

treatment, that had been condoned and there was no

unpleasantness or ill-treatment thereafter. Learned counsel also

went on to point out that the claim of PW1 that Shylaja had gone

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005           5


to reside with the 1st accused on compulsion cannot be justified

and the claim that Shylaja had gone only in the month of June

2002 is also false. Going by the terms of Ext.D1, it could be

seen, according to the learned counsel, that if all there was any

difference of opinion, that had been buried by the couple. These

aspects had not been noticed by the court below and the court

below has simply chosen to accept the evidence of PWs 1 and 2

without taking note of the subsequent developments and

according to the learned counsel, the findings of the court below

are unsustainable in law.

       8. Learned Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, contended

that the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 are sufficient to show that the

victim was ill-treated by the 1st accused who, in fact, manhandled

her on several occasions.      PWs 1 and 2 say that they had

occasion to see the accused beating the victim. The mere fact

that Ext.D1 is an admitted document by itself does not wipe off

the acts committed by the 1st accused which squarely fall within

the ambit of Section 498A IPC.        Therefore, according to the

learned Public Prosecutor, no grounds are made out to interfere

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005            6


with the findings of the court below and the conviction and

sentence have only to be sustained.

       9.      It is not disputed before this Court that a private

complaint was filed by deceased Shylaja before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court concerned which was forwarded for

investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. The complaint so filed

by the deceased is dated 24.05.1999.         That Shylaja died on

07.12.2002 is not a fact in dispute. There is no case for the

prosecution that Shylaja died due to any ill-treatment meted out

by the accused. Therefore, the learned counsel for the appellant

is justified in his submission that any of the facts stated in Ext.D1

cannot fall within the ambit of Section 32 of the Indian Evidence

Act.

       10. Coming to the facts of the case, the evidence regarding

the incident is confined to the testimony of PWs 1 and 2. PW1 is

the mother of the victim and PW2 is the sister of PW1. It is no

doubt true that PW1 says that she had occasion to see the

accused beating the victim. But, at the same time, she says that

most of her information regarding the ill-treatment is confined to

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005           7


what is told to her by the deceased. She does speak about the

act of the accused having kicked and knocked down the victim.

But it is admitted that she had no occasion to see the incident. It

is also true that going by the evidence of PW6, Shylaja had gone

to hospital complaining of abdominal pain and the entries in

Ext.P4 shows that it was due to the assault committed by the 1st

accused and a lady by name Remani who is none other than the

3rd accused. Learned Public Prosecutor, relying on the said entry,

contended that that is sufficient to show the ill-treatment meted

out by the 1st accused and the court below was therefore justified

in coming to the conclusion that offence under Section 498A IPC

is made out so also the offence under Section 323 IPC. The entry

in Ext.P4 is dated 02.05.1999 and it is admitted by PW1 that

Ext.D1 agreement is executed between the 1st accused and

deceased Shylaja.

       11. It is also significant to notice that PWs 1 and 4 are

witnesses to Ext.D1 document. If one goes through the recital in

Ext.D1, it can be seen that all the differences and disputes

between the couple were settled for ever and the evidence shows

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005          8


that soon after the execution of Ext.D1 document, the victim

namely, Shylaja had gone along with the 1st accused and they

were residing together along with their children till her death on

07.12.2002. It is also significant to notice that Ext.D1 makes

mention of the complaint laid by her and the case pending

against accused persons. She says that she does not wish to

prosecute it further. Except for a stray incident spoken to by

PWs 1 and 2, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the

accused had ill-treated the victim. It is significant to notice that

PW1 admits that at the time of marriage, there was no demand

for dowry made by the 1st accused or his parents. PW1 does say

that the victim was given 8 < sovereigns of gold. Even though

PWs 1 and 2 would say that the 1st accused used to complain

about inadequacy of dowry and lack of beauty, there is no

mention by PW1 or PW2 that any specific quantity of money or

gold was demanded by the accused persons before or after the

marriage. Under these circumstances, the claim made by PWs 1

and 2 that there was complaint of inadequacy of dowry and lack

of beauty can be taken only with a pinch of salt. Whatever that

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005             9


be, after the execution of Ext.D1 document, it is difficult to

understand          whether anything   survived     for  consideration

especially when the victim herself had wanted to give a quietus

to the issue.

       12. It is significant to notice that it is not disputed that the

victim, after the execution of Ext.D1, was residing with the 1st

accused. There is nothing to show that after they had taken up

residence together in pursuance to Ext.D1, there was any ill-

treatment or manhandling of the victim by the 1st accused. As

already noticed, any previous conduct, assuming there was any

physical assault, has been condoned by the execution of Ext.D1

and the couple were residing happily thereafter.         Under   these

circumstances, the finding of the court below that the offences

under Sections 498A and 323 IPC are made out cannot be

supported.

       In the result, the conviction and sentence passed against

the 1st accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 323 IPC

are set aside and it is held that he is not guilty of the said

offences. He stands acquitted of the said offences also. His bail

Crl. Appeal No.777/2005        10


bond shall stand cancelled and he is set at liberty. If he has paid

the fine amount, the same shall be refunded to him.

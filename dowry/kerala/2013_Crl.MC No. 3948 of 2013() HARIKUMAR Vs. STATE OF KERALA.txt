               ------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
               -------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                               ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.467 of

2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Mavelikkara which is a case instituted upon the police report

in Crime No.666 of 2010 of Mavelikkara Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 498(A) & 34 of I.P.C. with

a prayer to quash Annexure-A charge sheet in Crime No.666 of

2010 of Mavelikkara Police Station and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.467 of 2010 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara

as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.    The    prosecution        case     is    that   the first

petitioner/accused married the 2nd respondent/the de facto

complainant on 07/09/2009 in accordance with the custom and

rites prevailing among the Hindu religion and while the de

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                            :-2-:


facto complainant was residing in her matrimonial home the

accused demanded more dowry from her.           The de facto

complainant was subjected to harassment both mentally and

physically right from 0709/2009 onwards and thus the accused

have committed the offence punishable under Section 498(A)

read with Section 34 of IPC.    Now the case of the petitioners

is that, during the pendency of the case, the entire dispute is

settled with the second respondent, who is the de facto

complainant and the spouses are now residing together and

leading a peaceful marital life.   It appears that the second

respondent/the de facto complainant swore into an affidavit

dated 07/09/2013 stating about the settlement arrived and

expressing her no objection in quashing the proceedings

pending against the petitioners.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent.     I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                              :-3-:


settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.         In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offence involved in

the above case is only under Section 498(A) read with Section

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                                :-4-:


34 of IPC which is more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offence is involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court,             in the

decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)],

has held as follows:-

             "7.   It is not in dispute that matrimonial

        disputes have been on considerable increase in

        recent times resulting in filing of complaints under

        Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the

        husband but also against the relatives of the

        husband.   The question is when such matters are

        resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the

        matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

        pending   disputes   for   which   both  the   sides

        approached the High Court and jointly prayed for

        quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                                 :-5-:


        complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406

        of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the

        sole ground that since the offences are non-

        compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

        would be impermissible for the court to quash the

        criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

              8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand

        subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint

        under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3

        and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the

        help and intervention of family members, friends and

        well-wishers, the parties concerned have amicably

        settled    their   differences    and    executed    a

        compromise/settlement.        Pursuant   thereto,  the

        appellants filed the said compromise before the Trial

        Court with a request to place the same on record and

        to drop the criminal proceedings against the

        appellants herein. It is also not in dispute that in

        additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the

        parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

        stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal

        proceedings    against   the   appellants   and   fully

        supported the contents of the settlement deed. It is

        the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial

        Court rejected such prayer of the parties but also the

        High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction under

        Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

        criminal    proceedings    relate   to  the   offences

        punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                                   :-6-:


        which are non-compoundable in nature."

               "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to

        encourage     genuine    settlements   of   matrimonial

        disputes, particularly, when the same are on

        considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-

        compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes

        and the Court is satisfied that the parties have

        settled the same amicably and without any pressure,

        we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of

        justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar

        to the exercise of power of quashing of FIR,

        complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                  13.     There has been an outburst of

        matrimonial disputes in recent times. The institution

        of marriage occupies an important place and it has

        an important role to play in the society. Therefore,

        every effort should be made in the interest of the

        individuals in order to enable them to settle down in

        life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over

        their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably

        by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a

        Court of law, in order to do complete justice in the

        matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less

        hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction.

        It is trite to state that the power under Section 482

        should      be    exercised     sparingly   and    with

        circumspection only when the Court is convinced,on

        the basis of material on record, that allowing the

        proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                                :-7-:


        process of the Court or that the ends of justice

        require that the proceedings ought to be quashed."

In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.3948 of 2013
                               :-8-:


the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A charge sheet in Crime No.666 of 2010 of

Mavelikkara Police Station and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.467 of 2010 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara.

                   Crl.M.C. No. 1334 of 2015
             =======================
             Dated this the 17th day of March, 2015

                           O R D E R




      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.717 of 2013 of the

Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha District, registered for

the offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I Final Report and Annexure-II

FIR in Crime No.717 of 2013 of the Mannancherry Police

Station, Alappuzha District and all further proceedings based on

it in C.C.No.1129 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Alappuzha, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 1334 of 2015
                                 2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed. She has entered appearance

through her counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto

complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been

sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.      Through a settlement, the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

Crl.M.C. No. 1334 of 2015
                                  3

leading a peaceful married life.         When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioner, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I Final

Report and Annexure-II FIR in Crime No.717 of 2013 of the

Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha District and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1129 of 2014 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Alappuzha, are

hereby quashed.

                                      B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

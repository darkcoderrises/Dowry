                  RSA No.68 of 2007
           ---------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 7th day of January, 2014

                           JUDGMENT

     The defendants are in appeal.

     2. The suit was laid by the respondents for a

declaration that Ext.A12 document executed by the

first defendant, the father of the first respondent,

cancelling Ext.A1 gift deed and Ext.A13 sale deed

executed by the first defendant in favour of

defendants 2 to 4 are null and void as well as for a

decree of mandatory injunction directing defendants

1 to 5 to vacate the plaint schedule building and of

prohibitory injunction restraining defendants 1 to 5

from interfering with the peaceful possession and

enjoyment of the property by the first plaintiff.

     3. The plaintiffs allege that the plaint schedule

property originally belonged to the first defendant

and his brother Bather as per Ext.P2 partition deed

dated 25.5.1989 and the first defendant, after having

obtained absolute possession and title over the plaint

RSA No.68 of 2007       2

  schedule property, executed Ext.A1 gift deed dated

  25.5.1989 in favour of the first plaintiff and on the

  basis of the said gift deed, the first plaintiff had

  obtained title and possession over the plaint

  schedule property and that the first plaintiff has been

  enjoying the plaint schedule property absolutely.

  They further allege that defendants 2 and 3, who are

  her brothers, interfered with her possession and on

  26.9.1998, the first defendant executed Ext.A12

  deed cancelling Ext.A1 gift deed and thereafter he

  executed Ext.A13 sale deed in favour of defendants 2

  and 3. According to the plaintiffs, the first defendant

  had no right to cancel Ext.A1 gift deed since the gift

  deed has been accepted by the first defendant and

  the same has become complete. They further allege

  that the first defendant had no legal right to execute

  Ext.A13 sale deed covering the suit property in

  favour of defendants 2 and 3.

        4. Defendants 1 to 5, who resisted the suit,

  contended that defendants 1 to 4 are residing in the

RSA No.68 of 2007         3

  building situated in the suit property. According to

  them, Ext.A1 gift deed was executed by the first

  defendant in favour of the first plaintiff only for

  avoiding a crisis during the marriage of the first

  plaintiff. According to them, the gift deed had never

  come into effect and that the gift is not complete as

  per the provisions of the Mohammedan law. It was

  contended by the defendants that the physical

  possession in the plaint schedule property was never

  transferred to the first plaintiff and the first plaintiff

  went to the residence of her husband at Navaikulam

  after her marriage and occasionally she used to

  reside with the first defendant in the plaint schedule

  building. It was further contended that the first

  respondent took away the documents relating to the

  plaint schedule property from the building situated in

  the plaint schedule without the knowledge of

  anybody and they asserted that the gift deed has

  never come into force.

        5. In the written statement, the defendants have

RSA No.68 of 2007         4

  incorporated    a   counter     claim   for  permanent

  prohibitory injunction against the plaintiffs from

  disturbing the possession and enjoyment of the

  defendants of the plaint schedule property.         The

  plaintiffs have filed a written statement to the said

  counter claim.

        6. The trial court, after raising proper issues for

  trial, permitted both sides to adduce their evidence

  and at the trial PW1 and DW1 were examined.

  Exts.A1 to A13 and B1 to B4 were marked. The trial

  court, after considering the evidence, granted a

  decree as prayed for. The defendants, who are the

  appellants herein, took the matter in appeal before

  the lower appellate court. However, without success.

  It is with this background, the present appeal has

  been preferred.

        7. The material question to be considered in this

  appeal is whether Ext.A1 gift deed has come into

  force on a valid acceptance.          The parties being

  Muslims are governed by the Mahomedan law. A gift

RSA No.68 of 2007         5

  or 'hiba' which literally means 'giving away of such a

  thing from which the person in whose favour the gift

  deed is made may draw benefit'. 'Hiba' has been

  defined in Kanz al Daquiq in the following words:

  "Hiba is the making of another person owner of the

  corpus of property without taking its consideration

  from him". Therefore, gift is the transfer of movable

  or immovable property with immediate effect and

  without consideration by one person called the donor

  to another person called the donee and the

  acceptance of the same by one himself or by some

  one authorised on his behalf, provided that the

  person making the gift must totally renounce all his

  title and rights in the property gifted away of his

  independent free will." Every Mahomedan of sound

  mind and not a minor may dispose of his property by

  gift. The donee must be a person in existence. A

  Mahomedan gift as distinguished from a Will may be

  made of the whole of the donor's property and it may

  be made even to a heir. Here, there is no allegation

RSA No.68 of 2007          6

  that the donor was not having a sound mind. The

  donee was a person in existence. Though writing is

  not essential to validate the gift, here, the gift was on

  the basis of Ext.A1 deed.

        8. The three essentials of a Mahomedan gift are

  as follows:

        1)     a declaration of gift by the donor

        2)     an acceptance of the gift, express or

  implied, by or on behalf of the donee

        3)     delivery of possession of the subject of the

  gift by the donor to the donee. If these conditions

  are complied with, the gift is complete. Therefore,

  the three essential requisites for a valid gift are (1)

  the offer of the gift (2) acceptance there of and (3)

  delivery of possession.       It is settled law that the

  taking of possession of the subject matter of the gift

  by the donee either actually or constructively is

  necessary to complete a gift. It is also settled law

  that the registration of a deed does not cure the want

  of delivery of possession. If it is proved by oral

RSA No.68 of 2007         7

  evidence that a gift was completed as required by

  law, it is immaterial that the donor has also executed

  a deed of gift. A declaration in a deed of gift that

  possession has been given binds the heirs of the

  donor. Where a donor is in possession of the

  immovable property gifted, physical possession

  would be complete only when the donor physically

  departs from the premises with all his goods and

  chattels      and the  donee     formally  enters   into

  possession. However, no physical departure or formal

  entry is necessary in the case of a gift of immovable

  property in which the donor and the donee are both

  residing at the time of the gift. In such cases, the gift

  may be completed by some overt act by the donor

  indicating a clear intention on his part to transfer

  possession and to divest himself of all control over

  the subject of the gift. Here, the subject matter of

  the gift is the property where the donor and donee

  were residing.

        9. Therefore, the material question is whether

RSA No.68 of 2007         8

  there is any evidence to show that the gift has been

  completed by some overt act on the part of the donor

  indicating a clear intention. In the instant case, all

  the documents including the original of Ext.A1 are in

  possession of the plaintiffs. Though the defendants

  have taken up a contention that these documents

  have been stolen away by the plaintiffs, they could

  not substantiate the same.        Ext.A1 was cancelled

  after a gap of 8 years, i.e. on 16.9.1998. The reason

  shown in Ext.A12 cancellation deed is that the first

  plaintiff was not looking after the first defendant

  properly and she was not showing any affection

  towards him. It is further stated in Ext.A12 that the

  first plaintiff has other properties purchased by her

  and the first defendant had no other property for his

  livelihood.    Therefore, he cancelled the gift deed.

  These recitals lead the courts below to the conclusion

  that the first defendant was earnest in executing a

  gift deed in favour of the first plaintiff.

        10. Though it was strenuously contended by the

RSA No.68 of 2007         9

  defendants that Ext.A1 was executed in lieu of dowry

  and hit by the provisions of Dowry Prohibition Act, it

  cannot succeed as there is no whisper in Ext.A1 to

  that effect.

         11. On a careful analysis of the entire materials

  now placed on record, this Court is of the definite

  view that both the courts below have appreciated the

  evidence in the correct perspective and have arrived

  at the correct conclusion which does not call for an

  interference by this Court in second appeal.

        In the result, the appeal fails and accordingly

  dismissed.

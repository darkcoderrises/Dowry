                        BA No.6569 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 14th day of September 2012

                                  Order


            This petition is filed under Section 438 of Cr.PC.,

seeking anticipatory bail. The petitioners are accused Nos.1 to

4 in Crime No.1006/12 of Payyannur Police Station for having

committed the offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and

420 IPC. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

mentally and physically harassed the defacto complainant,

demanding more dowry. It is also alleged in the complaint that

the petitioners had represented that the first petitioner had

higher qualifications than what he actually possessed.             The

petitioners submit that the allegations are totally false and they

have been implicated with ulterior motives. Therefore, they

seek anticipatory bail.

            2. The learned Public prosecutor vehemently

opposed the application.

            3. Having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and going

that this is a fit case warranting exercise of the extra ordinary

jurisdiction of this court under Section 438 of Cr.PC.

Accordingly, this application is allowed as follows :

1. The petitioners may surrender before the Investigating Officer

   on or before 25.09.12, who, after interrogation,          shall

   produce them before the JFCM concerned.

2. On applications for bail being filed by the petitioners before

   the JFCM concerned, they shall be released on bail on each

   of them executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen

   Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

   sum each to the satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

3. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

   sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts produced by

   the sureties before granting bail to the petitioners.

4. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer

   as and when required by him, till final report is filed.

5. The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

BA 6569/12                          3

6. If any of the conditions are violated by any of the petitioners,

   the bail granted in respect of the said petitioner shall stand

   cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied of the

   said fact, may take such proceedings as are available to him

   in law.

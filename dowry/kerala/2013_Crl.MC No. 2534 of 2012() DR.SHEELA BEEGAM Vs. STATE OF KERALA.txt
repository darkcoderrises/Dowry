                    Crl.M.C.No. 2534 of 2012- B
                   ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 18th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                   The petitioner is the third accused in C.C.No.994 of

2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adoor in which the

offences alleged are under Sections 498A of the Indian Penal Code

and Section 24 of the Juvenile Justice Act,2000.           According to the

petitioner, the evidence and materials on record would not reveal the

offence against the petitioner herein, who is the third accused and the

mother-in-law of the de facto complainant.

         2. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and learned Public

Prosecutor.

         3. The learned counsel, inviting my attention to Annexure I

F.I.statement and also the additional statement of the de facto

complainant recorded by the investigating officer on 18.8.2009

submitted that as per the additional statement dated 18.8.2009, no

Crl.M.C.No.2534 of 2012
                                  :-2-:

overt act is attributed against the petitioner and therefore, the

proceedings pending against the petitioner is an abuse of process of

the court.

         4. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that difference, if any, between the F.I.statement and the additional

statement has to be appreciated by the trial court at the time of trial

and the same is not a ground to interfere with the proceedings pending

in the trial court.

          5. I have considered the submissions made by the counsel for

the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

         6. In Annexure A1 F.I.statement, it is clearly mentioned that

the husband of the de facto complainant and his mother, who is the

petitioner herein, had taken back the gold ornaments weighing 85

sovereigns from the de facto complainant. It is also stated in the very

same F.I.statement that after the marriage during the month of October

2001, the husband, his mother and his brother Shiji Shamsuddin

Crl.M.C.No.2534 of 2012
                                 :-3-:

subjected her to mental and physical harassment and such harassment

was in pursuance of demand for further dowry. It is relevant to note

that Annexure I F.I.statement contains the body note of the de facto

complainant and her minor daughter by which the S.I.of Police, who

had taken down the F.I.statement, noted the injuries on the body of the

de facto complainant and her minor daughter. It is also relevant to

note that even if the contention of counsel for the petitioner that the

de facto complainant has not stated anything about the overt act

petitioner in her additional statement, is accepted, it is for the trial

court to consider all these aspects at the time of appreciation of

evidence and consider the evidentiary value of the same and to come

into an independent conclusion. This Court will not be justified in

entering into any merit on the above contentions at this stage.

Therefore, there is no merit in this Crl.M.C.

Crl.M.C.No.2534 of 2012
                                   :-4-:

                      In the result, the above Crl.M.C. is dismissed as

devoid of any merit.

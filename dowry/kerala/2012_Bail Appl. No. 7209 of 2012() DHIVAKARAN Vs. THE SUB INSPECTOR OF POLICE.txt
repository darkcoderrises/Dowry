                     B.A. No.7209 of 2012
              ---------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 3rd day of October, 2012


                             O R D E R

       Petitioners are parents of the husband of the defacto

complainant. Allegation is that demanding more dowry the

petitioners cruelly harassed and manhandled the defacto

complainant. On the basis of the complaint filed by the defacto

complainant a crime has been registered against the petitioners

for the offences punishable under Section 498A of IPC.

       2. Materials placed before the court for perusal show

that the allegations are vague and general in nature.

Considering the nature of allegations and also the fact that the

custodial interrogation is not necessary, it is felt that this is a fit

case where extra ordinary jurisdiction of this court under

Section 438 of Cr.P.C. can be exercised in favour of the

petitioners. Accordingly, this application is allowed as follows :

  (1)  The petitioners shall surrender before the Investigating

      Officer within ten days from today, who after interrogation

      shall produce the petitioners before the JFCM court

      concerned, which court on applications being moved by

      the petitioners shall release them on bail on each of their

      executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen thousand

B.A.No.7209/2012                    2


     only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

     satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

  (2) The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

     sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts, before

     granting bail to the petitioners.

  (3) The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating

     Officer for interrogation as and when required by him.

  (4)   The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to tamper

     with the evidence and influence or try to influence the

     witnesses.

  (5) If any of the condition is violated, the bail granted shall

     stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being

     satisfied of the said fact, may take such proceedings as are

     available to him in law.



                                            P.BHAVADASAN,
                                                  Judge.

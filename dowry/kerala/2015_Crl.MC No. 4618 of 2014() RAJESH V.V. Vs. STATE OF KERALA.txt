         `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
            Dated this the 20th day of January, 2015

                               O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 in Crime

No.1238/2013 of Aroor Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A6 FIR in Crime No.1238/2013 of Aroor

Police Station as against the petitioners and all further

proceedings based on it pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Cherthala, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

Crl.M.C.4618/2014
                              : 2 :



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto   complainant,   who    is  the     3rd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners  and,   therefore,   all   further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

Crl.M.C.4618/2014
                                : 3 :



counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     Through a settlement the petitioner and the 3rd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A6

FIR in Crime No.1238/2013 of Aroor Police Station as

against the petitioners and all further proceedings based on

it pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Cherthala are hereby quashed.

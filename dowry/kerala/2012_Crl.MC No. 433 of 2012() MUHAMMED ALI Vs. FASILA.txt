            -------------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of September, 2012


                                  ORDER



      Petitioners in the above two petitions are the accused in a

pending case on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - II, Palakkad.        They are being prosecuted for offence

punishable under Section 498(A) r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code. Common first respondent in the two petitions, who is the

wife of the first accused in the case, filed a complaint before the

Magistrate imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment by her

husband and his close relatives, the other accused, demanding

dowry. That complaint was referred to police for investigation and

report. A crime on such reference was registered at Mannarkkad

Police Station. Later, since the offence imputed occurred within

the jurisdiction of another police station, the F.I.R was transmitted

to that station, Kongad Police Station, where the crime was

re-registered. After completion of investigation, final report was

laid indicting the accused, all three of them, for the offence stated

Crl.M.C Nos.433 & 893/2012        2




supra. Challenge canvassed in these petitions is that where the

Station House Officer to whom complaint was sent by the

Magistrate for registration of the crime found that the offence

imputed does not fall within his jurisdiction, then, he should have

sought prior permission of the Magistrate to transfer the F.I.R

registered in the crime to another station. I do not find any merit

in the challenge so canvassed. Without taking cognizance of the

offence imputed in the complaint, the Magistrate has forwarded

the complaint under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure to the Station House Officer within his jurisdiction.

Once a crime is registered thereof, Station House Officer or police

officer concerned has to proceed in accordance with law, and

where he found that the offence imputed fall within the

jurisdiction of another station, he had to transmit the F.I.R to that

station for investigation.   That alone was done in the present

case.   Learned counsel for the petitioners also urged that the

allegations raised in the complaint for registration of the crime

are baseless and in fact they do not make out the essential

ingredients to constitute the offence under Section 498(A) of the

Crl.M.C Nos.433 & 893/2012         3




Indian Penal Code with which the accused now stands indicted

after filing of the final report. Whatever defences available to the

petitioners, if so available, can be canvassed by them before the

Magistrate as provided by law. Reserving their right to do so,

these petitions are dismissed.

                      Crl.M.C.No. 2297 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No.505 of 2012

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg      which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 150/2012 of

Chittarrikkal Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 341,323,324 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure I Charge and all further proceeding in C.C.No.505 of

2012 on the file of the JFCM-II, Hosdurg as the matter is settled out

of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 16.4.2012 at

10.45 hours while the de facto complainant was travelling in his car

and when he reached at Kummumkai in Bhemnadi village, due to

Crl.M.C.No.2297 of 2013

                                  :-2-:

political enmity, accused Nos.1 to 3 restrained the de facto

complainant and dragged him out of the car. It is alleged that the first

petitioner beat him with an iron rod and others with hand and now, the

case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and he has no

Crl.M.C.No.2297 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 341,323,324 read with Section 34 I.P.C., which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

Crl.M.C.No.2297 of 2013

                                                :-4-:

no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-

                       "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
             case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
             injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

Crl.M.C.No.2297 of 2013

                                         :-5-:

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
         victim........"


         8.      According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of

this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.        Thus, according to me, following the decision cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

Crl.M.C.No.2297 of 2013

                                 :-6-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I

charge and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.505/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Hosdurg.

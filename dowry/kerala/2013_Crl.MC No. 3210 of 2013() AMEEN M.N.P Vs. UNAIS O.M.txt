                  Crl.M.C.No.3210 of 2013
             -------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 01st day of August, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 9 in S.C.No.83 of

2007 on the file of the Assistant Sessions Court, Payyannur

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.431 of 2005 of Payyannur Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 324 and 308

read with Section 149 of IPC. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-I Final Report in Crime No.431 of 2005 of

Payyannur Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.83 of 2007 on the file of the

Assistant Sessions Court, Payyannur as the matter is settled

out of court.

    2.    The allegation of the prosecution is that on

25/11/2005 at 21.00 hours accused Nos.1 to 9, activists of

Muslim league unlawfully assembled at Ramanthali amsom

Crl.M.C.No.3210 of 2013
                             :-2-:


Vadakumbad      and    unlawfully  restrained   the   de   facto

complainant with an intention of committing the crime and

accused No.1 attacked him with a knife and other accused

beaten him with wooden stick etc. due to political enmity and

sustained injury and thereby committed the offences. Thus,

according to the prosecution, the accused has committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 324

and 308 read with Section 149 of IPC. Now the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled with the de facto

complainant, who is the first respondent herein, who sworn

into Annexure-II affidavit.

     3.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

324 and 308 read with Section 149 of IPC. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

Crl.M.C.No.3210 of 2013
                                       :-3-:


counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

Crl.M.C.No.3210 of 2013
                                   :-4-:


        arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

        partnership or such like transactions or the offences

        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

Crl.M.C.No.3210 of 2013
                             :-5-:


resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I Final Report in Crime No.431 of 2005 of Payyannur

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in S.C.No.83 of 2007 on the file of the Assistant

Sessions Court, Payyannur.

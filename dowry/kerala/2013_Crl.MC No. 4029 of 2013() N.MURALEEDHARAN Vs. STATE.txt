                  -----------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                 ------------------------------------
        Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in Crime No.800 of 2012

of Tirur Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 420, 465, 468 & 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-A complaint and Annexure-B F.I.R. in Crime No.800

of 2012 of Tirur Police Station, Malappuram District as the

matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The prosecution allegation in brief is that the second

respondent being a professional videographer, was entrusted

with the responsibility of video-graphing the famous festival of

Vairankode temple known as 'Theeyyat Ulsavam' during the

year 2009. It was agreed by the then Executive Officer of the

Vairankode Devaswam that the video CD will be sold at a rate

of `100/- per CD and out of which `80/- will be paid to the

second respondent.       Second respondent has recorded the

festival incurring huge expenses and entrusted 2000 CDs to

Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                             :-2-:

the first petitioner. However, apart from a sum of `5,000/- the

petitioners did not pay any further amount to the second

respondent. Whenever the second respondent approached the

petitioners, they were reiterating that the CDs are not being

sold. However, later, second respondent has been informed

that the entire CDs except a few were sold out and with the

knowledge of the petitioners, huge amounts were withdrawn in

the name of the second respondent through Bank accounts by

forging the signature of the second respondent. On further

enquiry, it is given to understand that the cheques were issued

in the name of the second respondent and which were

encashed by the petitioners, by forging the signature of the

second respondent. Thus, according to the prosecution, the

accused two in numbers have committed the offences

punishable under Sections 420, 465 & 468 read with Section

34 of IPC. Now, according to the petitioners, the dispute is

settled with the second respondent, who has sworn into

Annexure-C affidavit.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                             :-3-:

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-C affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                                   :-4-:

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 420, 465, 468 & 34

of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                                       :-5-:

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

Crl.M.C.No.4029 of 2013
                             :-6-:

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A complaint and Annexure-B F.I.R. in Crime No.800

of 2012 of Tirur Police Station, Malappuram District and all

further proceedings thereto.

          Dated this the 16th day of July, 2015

                          ORDER

     The revision petitioner is the respondent in MC

No.368 of 2011 on the files of the Family Court, Thrissur,

filed by the respondents herein; who are the wife and son

of the petitioner claiming maintenance allowance under

Sec.125(1) of the Cr.P.C. According to the 1st respondent,

her marriage with the petitioner was solemnized in the

year 2005. Later the relationship between them became

strained as she was harassed with cruelty both mentally

and physically by the petitioner herein and the petitioner

demanded more dowry and money, after consuming

intoxicated liquor. When his behavior became intolerable,

she left the company with the only child and therefore she

is residing in her parental home. She has no job or any

source of income to maintain herself and the 2nd

respondent. But the petitioner is conducting the business

                              -2-
R.P.(F.C). No. 253 of 2014



of auto fancy items at Irinjalakkuda and deriving a

monthly income of Rs.40,000/-. The petitioner resisted

the claim for maintenance allowance on the ground that

she left the company with the child on her own volition

but he admitted the marital status of the 1st respondent

and the paternity of the 2nd respondent. He denied the

respondent's case that he is conducting business of auto

fancy items and getting Rs.40,000/- per month. The

legality of the entitlement of maintenance allowance and

the correctness of the quantum of maintenance fixed by

the court below is under challenge in this revision

petition.

       2.     Going by the impugned order, it is seen that

the petitioner himself deposed before the court that he is

not prepared to take back his wife and child, as he is not

interested to continue the marital relationship. It has also

come out in evidence that he has also filed OP

No.395/2012 seeking dissolution of marriage. He has no

                               -3-
R.P.(F.C). No. 253 of 2014



case that he has been paying maintenance allowance to

the respondents after 2011. In that context, the family

court is justified in finding that he is liable to pay

maintenance allowance to the respondents.

       3.     Going      to the quantum  of   maintenance

allowance, it is the case of the 1st respondent that he is

conducting a business of auto fancy items. The 1st

respondent deposed that the petitioner was working

abroad for a long time and he amazed huge wealth, while

he was employed abroad and he is maintaining a motor

car. But no documentary evidence has been produced to

substantiate the said contention. After analysing the oral

evidence given by both parties, the court below arrived

at a finding that even in the absence of documentary

evidence, it can be safely concluded that the petitioner is

a man having sufficient means to pay maintenance

allowance to his family. That apart, he has no case that

he is physically disabled or incapacitated to do any work,

                              -4-
R.P.(F.C). No. 253 of 2014



so as to earn livelihood for his family. An able bodied

man is also presumed to be having sufficient earning

capacity. Even though petitioner has contended that the

respondent is working in a shop, he could not prove that

the petitioner is earning livelihood for herself and the 2nd

respondent. The term 'maintenance' provided under

Sec.125 of the Cr.P.C includes provision for food, clothes,

residence etc.

       4.     Having regard to the steep hike in the cost of

living, caused by inflation, and the evidence available on

record, the court below is justified in determining the

quantum of maintenance allowance at the rate of

Rs.3,000/- per mensum to the 1st respondent and

Rs.1,500/- per mensum to the 2nd respondent.

       5.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

of the case, the revision petitioner is given five months'

time to pay the arrear, provided that, the revision

                                -5-
R.P.(F.C). No. 253 of 2014



petitioner shall pay half of the entire arrear within a

period of three months from today and the remaining

balance shall be paid within the next two months. In the

event of failure to pay the first instalment within the

specified       time,    this facility will stand  cancelled

automatically and the Family Court will be free to

enforce the realisation of entire arrear in lump sum.

       This Revision Petition is dismissed accordingly.

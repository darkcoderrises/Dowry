                Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of July, 2013

                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No.293/2013 of

Balussery Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 420, 415, 405, 468 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., with a

prayer to quash the F.I.R. in Crime No.293/2013 of

Balussery Police Station and all further proceedings pursuant

to Annexure-A charge sheet as the matter is settled out of

court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that the

accused persons 1 and 2 along with the 3rd accused

Devadasan, the document writer agreed to sell 48 cents of

land owned by the accused Sasi and for a total consideration

of Rs.6,35,000/- the said Sasi executed assignment deed

No.1598/12 of Naduvannur Sub-Registry Office. The further

case was that, when the complainant approached the Village

Office for paying land tax they refused to accept land tax

stating that the vendor has no right over the property and thus

Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
                                2

the accused persons committed offence under Sections 420,

415, 405, 468 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court between

themselves and the defacto complainant, who is the first

respondent herein, who sworn into Annexure-B affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
                                3

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 420, 415, 405, 468 r/w

Section 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

first respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
                                     4

as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:           the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the    criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
                                     5

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

Crl.M.C.No. 2984 of 2013
                                6

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No.293 of Balussery Police Station and all

further proceedings thereto.

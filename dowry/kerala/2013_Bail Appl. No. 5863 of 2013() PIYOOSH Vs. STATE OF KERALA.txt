                        B.A.No.5863 OF 2013
                 ---------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of September, 2013.

                               O R D E R

       Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No. 1260/2013 of

Ezhukone Police Station, Kollam district, registered for the

offences punishable under Section 498A read with 34 IPC. He

has moved the above application seeking anticipatory bail under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for short, 'the

Code'.

       2. Crime was registered on a complaint filed by the wife of

petitioner before the magistrate which may referred to police for

investigation report. Petitioner and his parents were implicated

as the accused in the crime as having harassed, intimidated and

inflicted cruelty on defacto complainant, his wife, demanding

dowry. During the course of investigation, it is submitted father

of petitioner, second accused named in the complaint, had been

deleted from the array of accused, and at present, crime is being

proceeded only against petitioner and his mother. All the three

accused named in the complaint together had moved an

B.A.No.5863/2013                  2


application for anticipatory bail before sessions judge, and taking

note of removal of second accused from the crime and also the

facts and circumstances involved, pre-arrest bail was granted to

the mother of petitioner but declined to petitioner.        Learned

counsel for petitioner submits that complaint was filed by

defacto complainant before the magistrate after he had moved

the Family Court for dissolving marriage of the spouses. Knowing

of the institution of such proceedings as a counter blast, defacto

complainant launched criminal proceedings against him and his

parents on false allegations, is the submission of counsel.

Learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions, submits

appearance of petitioner before the investigating officer for

interrogation is essential for fair investigation of crime, whether

he has to be arrested or not for investigation of the offence

alleged can be decided only after his interrogation and collection

of other materials, is the further submission of learned Public

Prosecutor

        3. Case diary has been produced for my perusal.       After

looking into the complaint of defacto complainant and also the

B.A.No.5863/2013                       3


submissions made by learned counsel for petitioner that the

complaint was filed after institution of proceedings by husband

before the Family Court, I find petitioner can be granted pre-

arrest bail with direction to co-operate with the investigation of

the crime.

       i. Petitioner shall report before the investigating officer at

           10 a.m. on 10.09.2013.        On such appearance after his

           interrogation, in the event of his arrest in the crime, he is

           directed to be released on bail on his executing a bond for

          10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with one solvent

           surety.

       ii. Petitioner has to report before the investigating officer

           later also, if his presence is demanded by the investigating

           officer for smooth completion of investigation of crime.

                         V.K.MOHANAN, J
                ===========================
                      Crl.M.C No.3333 of 2014
                ============================
               Dated this the 25th day of August, 2014

                               ORDER


      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioner,

who is accused in Crime No.711 of 2012 of Vallikkunnam Police

Station for the offences punishable under Section 308 of the Indian

Penal Code and Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings in Annexure I final report in Crime No.

712/2012 of the Vallikkunnam Police Station, Alappuzha which is now

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I,

Kayamkulam as C.P No.92/2013 as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.    The allegation in the above case is that on 24.09.2012 at

9:45 a.m due to the previous animosity towards the de facto

complainant in refusing his love the petitioner hit the de facto

Crl.M.C No.3333 of 2014

                                       2



complainant with his bike and thereby caused injuries to her and thus,

the accused committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

          6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

Crl.M.C No.3333 of 2014

                                         3



case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties

to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

punishable under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 23

of the Juvenile Justice Act, which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved.       It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note

the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus:    the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

Crl.M.C No.3333 of 2014

                                              4



           exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
           the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
           in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
           of any Court.       In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
           the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
           prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such
           like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
           relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is
           basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
           resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of
           the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility
           of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
           case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite        full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

Crl.M.C No.3333 of 2014

                                       5



amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I final

report and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.P.No.

Crime No.712/2012 of the Vallikkunnam Police Station.

                              O R D E R

      The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.267/2012 of

Pandikkad Police Station, Malappuram District. The offence

alleged against him is under section 498A of IPC.

Apprehending arrest, this petition is filed for anticipatory

bail.

      2.   The complainant is the wife of the petitioner.

Their marriage took place in 1994. It is alleged that the

petitioner had subjected the complainant to physical and

mental cruelty demanding more money as dowry. There is a

specific allegation that the petitioner beat the complainant

and she was admitted in the hospital. A copy of the wound

certificate is available in the case diary. It shows that she

had sustained injury on the lip, knee besides the lacerated

injury   on the/near the right eye etc.             Two other similar

injuries are also seen. The learned counsel for the petitioner

B.A.No.4691/2012
                              -2-


submits   that   the  petitioner    was   attacked    by    the

complainant's brother and other persons, in respect of

which, a crime was registered alleging offences under

sections 448, 341    and 323 r/w 34 of IPC.       The learned

Sessions Judge, after a thorough discussion of the materials,

dismissed the application for anticipatory bail.

     3.   The learned Public Prosecutor submits that the

allegation of cruelty mentioned in this case is not a mere

allegation as seen in other complaints. But it is seen that

the complainant was subjected to intolerable physical and

mental cruelty. It was specifically alleged that the petitioner

married another woman. The petitioner wanted to justify it

stating that the personal law allows him to marry another

woman. But the learned Public Prosecutor submits that after

he married another woman, he started attacking the

complainant in a most inhuman manner. It is alleged that

the complainant was kicked on the abdomen also. There are

so many other serious allegations also. Taking note of the

B.A.No.4691/2012
                               -3-


serious allegations, I find that it is not a case where the

petitioner is to be granted anticipatory bail.

     Hence it is dismissed.

           ======================

                    B.A. NO. 4354 OF 2013

         =======================

        Dated this the 25th day of June 2013

                          ORDER



     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No. 527 of

2013 of Cheranelloor Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 294

(b), 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

The allegation against the petitioner and other accused

is that they have tortured and harassed the de facto

complainant and treated her with cruelty by demanding

more dowry.

     2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the case diary. It

is alleged that on 23/5/2013, the de facto complainant

BA 4354/2013                 2

was severely beaten by the petitioner and his parents

and she was thrown out of the house. The neighbours

called the brother of the de facto complainant. He came

and patched up the situation and she could gain entry

back to the house. Again, on 26/5/2013, she was

severely beaten by the petitioner and thereby she was

taken to the General Hospital, Ernakulam where she was

admitted. The case was registered by the Cheranelloor

police on the basis of the intimation from the hospital.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

anticipatory bail has been granted to the other accused

by the learned Sessions Judge. On going through the

facts and circumstances of this case and considering the

seriousness of the allegations against the petitioner,

I am of the view that the petitioner is not entitled the

discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

BA 4354/2013                      3

            This bail application is dismissed. At the same

time, if so advised, the petitioner may surrender before

the investigating officer within ten days from today and

in such case, the investigating officer can interrogate the

petitioner and conduct the investigation and produce the

petitioner without delay before the concerned Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court, where the petitioner can

move for bail. In such case, the learned Magistrate shall

pass appropriate orders, preferably on the same day

itself.

                       V.K.MOHANAN, J.
              ------------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 02nd day of September, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.245 of 2007 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Pathanamthitta which is a case instituted upon the police

report in Crime No.142 of 2006 of Konni Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 464, 465 & 420 read with

Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-AII Final

Report/Charge in Crime No.142 of 2006 of Konni Police

Station and all further proceedings in C.C.No.245 of 2007 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Pathanamthitta as the matter is settled out of court.

     2. The allegation in the above case is that, the 1st accused

is a proprietor of Periyar Group Publications. The de facto

complainant was the authorized agent of the said publication

at Pathanamthitta.        The complainant issued a cheque

Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013  :-2-:

No.248114 dated 20.12.2004 for `2,780/- drawn on the South

Indian Bank, Konni Branch in order to discharge the liability

that the de facto complainant owe to the 1st accused to Periyar

Publications.    But the accused 1 and 2 together illegally

fabricated to the said cheque for `12,780/- and encashed the

same by presenting the cheque through their account with

Federal Bank, Aluva Branch. Thus the de facto complainant

suffered a loss of `10,000/-. Likewise the 1st and 2nd accused

together    illegally fabricated  cheque    No.248119    dated

03/12/2011 for `2,574/- drawn on the South Indian Bank, Konni

branch as a cheque for `12,574/-. But on getting information

regarding the illegal acts of the accused with respect to the

first cheque the de facto complainant issued a stop memo to

the bank and it was returned dishonoured on presentation.

Thereafter the 1st accused issued statutory notice to the de

facto complainant under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and the de

facto complainant issued a reply. Thus, according to the

prosecution     the  accused   has committed     the  offences

punishable under Sections 464, 465 & 420 read with Section

34 of I.P.C.    Now, the case of the petitioner is that during

Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013  :-3-:

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled with the

second respondent who has sworn into Annexure-A3 affidavit.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the respondents.     I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of

the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings

in the above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the respondents who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the 2nd respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A3 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013      :-4-:

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 464, 465 & 420 read

with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the respondents, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013          :-5-:

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

Crl.M.C.No.3384 of 2013  :-6-:

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 Final Report/Charge in Crime No.142 of 2006 of

Konni Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in C.C.No.245 of 2007 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Pathanamthitta.

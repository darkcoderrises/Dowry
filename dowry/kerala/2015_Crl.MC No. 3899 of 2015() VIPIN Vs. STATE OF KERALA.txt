               =========================
                       Crl.M.C.No.3899 of 2015
               =========================
                   Dated this the 13th day of July, 2015

                                 ORDER

      The petitioners herein are the accused in C.C.No.156/2013 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Varkala. They seek orders

quashing the prosecution on the ground of amicable settlement of

the whole dispute between them and the de facto complainant.

Crime in this case was registered under Section 4 of the Dowry

Prohibition Act on the complaint of one Sunu, who is the 2nd

respondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has

settled the whole dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance

or complaint now.

      2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held

that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High

Court can quash the prosecution in pending proceedings, if the

parties have really settled the whole dispute amicably out of court,

and continuance of further proceedings will not serve any purpose in

such a circumstance of amicable settlement. Here, I find a real and

genuine case of settlement between the parties. This is not a case

Crl.M.C.No.3899 of 2015
                                      2

involving any public interest or public issue. The parties have come

to terms amicably on the intervention of persons acceptable to both

sides, and I am satisfied that the parties are now on quite cordial

terms. In such a situation, continuance of the prosecution will not

serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court.

No doubt, nobody will support the prosecution in such a situation, if

the case goes to trial.

        In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against

the petitioners herein in C.C.No.156/2013 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-1, Varkala will stand quashed under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.             Accordingly, the petitioners will

stand released from prosecution and the bail bond, if any, executed

by them will stand discharged.

                Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                -------------------------------
      Dated this the 26th day of September, 2014.


                        O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in

C.C.No.136 of 2013 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court-

Kasaragod, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.724 of 2012 of Kasaragod Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 454,

392 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in the above

calendar case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

10.6.2012 at 3.30 p.m. at Chowki Quarters in Kudlu village,

the accused persons trespassed into the rented Quarters of

the de facto complainant and snatched his gold chain from

Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                               2

his neck and thereby committed the offence as alleged by

the prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute, which is the subject matter of the above case, as

per Annexure A3 affidavit signed by the 1st respondent/de

facto complainant. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law

and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                                3

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

         6.        I  have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 454, 392

r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.       From the submission made by the

Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                                    4

counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,

Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                                   5

         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

Crl.M.C.No.5466 of 2014
                                6

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.136 of 2013 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court-

Kasaragod, pursuant to Crime No.724 of 2012 of Kasaragod

Police Station.

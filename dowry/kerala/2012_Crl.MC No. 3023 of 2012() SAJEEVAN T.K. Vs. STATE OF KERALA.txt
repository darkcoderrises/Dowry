                Crl.M.C. NO. 3023 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 01st day of October, 2012

                             ORDER


            Petitioner is the accused in a pending case on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-V, Kozhikode. He is

being prosecuted for offences punishable under Section 498A

read with Section 406 of the Indian Penal Code, on a report

filed by the Sub Inspector of Police, Nallam Police Station.

That crime arose on a complaint given by the second

respondent, wife of the petitioner, imputing of matrimonial

cruelty demanding dowry and also misappropriation of her

properties committing criminal breach of trust.       Now the

spouses have resolved all matrimonial disputes and are living

together, is the submission of the learned counsel for

petitioner, which is endorsed by the counsel appearing for the

second respondent/wife. An affidavit has also been sworn to

by the second respondent/wife asserting that she is presently

living with her husband and she is not interested in

Crl.M.C. NO. 3023 of 2012         2



prosecuting him in the case. Learned Public Prosecutor after

getting instruction also reports that the spouses are living

together under the same roof. Having regard to the nature of

the offence imputed and taking note that in view of the

settlement chances of a successful prosecution against the

petitioner/husband     are  rather  remote,    I  find   further

continuation of the criminal proceedings in the case is not

warranted.     Since the crime has arisen on account of the

matrimonial disputes between the spouses it could also be

stated that it is personal and not affecting the public at large.

In the circumstance, criminal proceedings against the

petitioner/accused in C.C.No.956/2011 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate-V, Kozhikode, are quashed

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

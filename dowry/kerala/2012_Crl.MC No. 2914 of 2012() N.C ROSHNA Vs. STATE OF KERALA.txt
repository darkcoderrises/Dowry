           -------------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 28th day of September, 2012


                                 ORDER



      The above petition has been filed jointly by the de facto

complainant and the accused in a pending case numbered as

C.C No.570 of 2011 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - II, Kannur. Second petitioner is the husband of the first

petitioner, de facto complainant, and the other petitioners are

the close relatives of the husband.            Imputing of matrimonial

cruelty and harassment by the husband, the in laws and his

close relatives, demanding dowry, the first petitioner, wife, gave

a complaint before the Magistrate, which led to registration of

the crime and later indictment of petitioners 2 to 6 for the

offence of under Section 498(A) r/w Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code under Annexure A1 report.                  Cognizance of the

offence taken by the Magistrate the case as referred to above is

awaiting trial. Now, the parties have settled the matter and the

first and second petitioners are living together, is the submission

Crl.M.C No.2914/2012             2




made for quashing the criminal proceedings against the

accused persons petitioners 2 to 6. Learned Public Prosecutor,

after ascertaining through the Investigating Officer, reports that

the spouses are now living together after resolving all

matrimonial disputes between them.         In the circumstance,

having regard to the nature of the offence involved and also the

circumstance under which indictment of the offence levelled

against petitioners 2 to 6 on the complaint of the first petitioner,

I find, continuation of the criminal proceedings against the

accused persons is not called for. Though the offence imputed

against the accused persons is noncompoundable and also not

falling under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for

short, 'the Code', having regard to the directions/guidelines

given by the apex court in exercising the inherent powers of the

court under Section 482 in cases of such nature in "Gian Singh

Vs State of Punjab"(2012(4) KLT 108(SC)), I find,

continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioners

2 to 6 is not required.       Criminal proceedings against the

Crl.M.C No.2914/2012            3




petitioners in CC. No.570 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court - II, Kannur are quashed under Section

482 of the Code.

      Petition is allowed.

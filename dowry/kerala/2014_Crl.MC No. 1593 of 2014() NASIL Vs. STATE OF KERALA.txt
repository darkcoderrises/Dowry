           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 24th day of March, 2014


                                      O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is field by the 2nd

accused in C.C.No.782/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, to quash the proceedings as

against him, in view of the settlement arrived at between

the defacto-complainant and other injured persons under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the 2nd accused in C.C.No.782/2012 on the file

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam. On the

basis of the statement given by the 2nd respondent/ Defacto-

complainant Annexure-A1 First Information Report was

registered a crime as Crime No.294/2012 of Mattancherry

Police Station, against the present petitioner and another,

Crl. M.C. No.1593 of 2014
                                   2

alleging offences under Section 451, 323 and Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was

field and the case was taken on file as C.C.No.782/2012 and

it is pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court-

Ernakulam. Now the matter has been settled between the

2nd respondent, defacto-complainant and others. In view of

the settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction

being entered against the petitioner. Since some of the

offences are non compoundable in nature, they could not

file any application before the court below, for recording

the composition. So the petitioner has no other remedy,

except to approach this court, seeking the following relief:

            "For these and other reasons which may be urged
      at the time of hearing it is most respectfully prayed that
      this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to call for the entire
      records leading to Annexure-I charge in C.C.782/12 in
      Crime No.294/12 of Mattancherry Police, now before
      Chief Judicial Magistrate Court at Ernakulam and to
      quash the charge as against the petitioner, by allowing
      this Criminal MC, in the interest of justice."

            3.    Originally, only the defacto-complainant was

impleaded as 2nd respondent and he entered appearance

through counsel and also filed Annexure-2 affidavit. Later

Crl. M.C. No.1593 of 2014
                                 3

the other two injured persons were also impleaded as

additional         respondent,      as      per     order       in

Crl.M.A.No.2795/2014 and they           filed R3(a) and R3(b)

affidavits and they were represented by the same counsel,

who was appearing for the 2nd respondent as well.

            4.    The counsel for respondents 2 to 4 submitted

that, the matter has been settled and it arose on account of

a family dispute and it has been settled due to the

intervention of mediators, friends and family members. So

they do not want to prosecute the case. The counsel for the

petitioner also submitted that in view of the settlement,

possibility of conviction is remote.

            5.    Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,

as directed by this court, submitted that, except this case,

there is no cases against the petitioner, but opposed the

application.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Annexure-1 crime

was registered and after investigation, final report was field

Crl. M.C. No.1593 of 2014
                                     4

and it was taken on file as C.C. 782/2012 on the file of the

Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, against the

present petitioner and another.               The matter has been

settled between the parties. The parties are relatives as

well. Annexures-2, R3(a) and (b) affidavits field by the

respondents 2 to 4 will go to show that, the family dispute,

which is the basis for the registration of this crime has been

settled amicably between them and the original harmony

has been restored in the family on account of the

settlement.

            7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.    In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

Crl. M.C. No.1593 of 2014
                                       5

      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the crime itself

has been originated on the basis of a family dispute and that

has been settled between the parties and peace and

harmony has been restored in the family on account of the

settlement and no possibility of conviction, if the case is

Crl. M.C. No.1593 of 2014
                                  6

allowed to proceed with against the petitioner, in view of

the settlement, this court feels that, it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the 'Code' has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings, as against the petitioner, so as to

promote peace and harmony that has been restored in the

family on account of the settlement. So the application is

allowed and further proceedings in C.C.No.782/2012 (Crime

No.294/2012 of Mattancherry Police Station) pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, as

against the petitioner is quashed. Office is directed to

communicate          this order    to    the concerned        court,

immediately.

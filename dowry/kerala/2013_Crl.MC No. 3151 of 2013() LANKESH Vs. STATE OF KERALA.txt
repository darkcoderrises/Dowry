                  Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.No.472 of 2012 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Punalur

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.435 of 2012 of Anchal Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 427 & 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 Final Report and all

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.472 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Punalur as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.    The      allegations        levelled        against  the

petitioners/accused in the above crime is that on 09/04/2012 at

about 4 p.m, the accused on account of previous enmity

wrongfully restrained the de facto complainant and used

abusive words against him and the 1st accused assaulted the

de facto complainant by slapping on the left side of de facto

Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
                            :-2-:


complainant's face with his hand and when the wife of the de

facto complainant intervened, the 1st accused used abusive

words and insulted her. It is also alleged that the 2nd accused

kicked on the ribs of the de facto complainant and caused

damage to the shirt worn by the de facto complainant. It was

further alleged that on account of the acts of the accused, de

facto complainant sustained a loss of `3200/- and it is the case

of the de facto complainant that the incident occurred at a

place near to Agasthyakode Old L.P.School in Anchal Village.

Thus, according to the prosecution, the accused has committed

the offences punishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 427

& 34 of IPC. According to the petitioners, when the matter is

pending before the court below for consideration the dispute is

settled between them and the second respondent, who is the

de facto complainant as they are friends. Annexure-A2 is the

affidavit sworn into by the de facto complainant, the second

respondent herein.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent.     I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
                             :-3-:


        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A2 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
                                    :-4-:


in the above case are only under Sections 341, 294(b), 323,

427 & 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in

the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

Crl.M.C.No.3151 of 2013
                             :-6-:


to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.472 of 2012 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Punalur.

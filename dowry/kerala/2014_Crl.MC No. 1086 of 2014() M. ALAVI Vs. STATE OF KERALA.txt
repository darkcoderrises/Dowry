                      Crl.M.C.No.1086 of 2014
                   ..................................................
            Dated this the 28th day of February, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This is    an    application filed              by the sole        accused in

C.C.No.231/12 on the file of the                 Chief       Judicial    Magistrate

Court, Manjeri, to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section 482 of the                          Code of       Criminal

Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the second respondent

had filed   a private       complaint           before the           Chief  Judicial

Magistrate Court, Manjeri against the petitioner alleging the

offences under Sections 420, 468, 406 and 471 of the Indian

Penal Code which was forwarded to the police for investigation

by the learned magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure and on that basis, Annexure A2 crime

was registered as Crime No.965/12 of Manjeri police station

in Malappuram District and after investigation                          final report

has been filed as Annexure A4 against the petitioner alleging

the offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal

Code and Annexure A5 affidavit has been filed alleging that

Crl.M.C.No.1086 of 2014             2

the offences under Sections 406 and 420 were deleted. The

case was taken on file as C.C.No.231/12 by the learned Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri and it is pending before

that    court. In the meantime,         the matter has been settled

between the defacto complainant and the petitioner and the

second respondent does not want to proceed with the

prosecution. There is no possibility of conviction being entered

against the petitioner as well in view of the settlement. So he

has no other option, but to approach this Court seeking the

following relief.

        For these and other grounds that may be urged at the
        time of hearing this Court may be pleased to quash all
        further proceedings in C.C.No.231/12 on the file of the
        Chief Judicial Matgistrate Court, Manjeri, Malappuram
        district.



        3. The second respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled and he has no

grievance against the petitioner at present.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, who opposed the

application, on instructions, submitted that there is no other

case against the petitioner.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a private

complaint      filed  by the second       respondent,      a   crime was

Crl.M.C.No.1086 of 2014             3

registered against the petitioner and after investigation, final

report was filed and it is now pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Manjeri as C.C.No.231/12 for the offences

under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code though

the offences under Sections 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal

Code were also alleged in the private complaint.                Now the

matter has been settled between the parties and the second

respondent has filed Annexure A5             affidavit stating that the

matter has been settled and he has no grievance against the

petitioner now. Though in the complaint it was mentioned as a

visa transaction, ultimately it appears that it was a case of

money transaction between them. Since the petitioner has not

returned the money, that promoted the second respondent to

file the complaint.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

           "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
           and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
           different footing for the purposes of quashing,
           particularly the offences arising from commercial,
           financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family

Crl.M.C.No.1086 of 2014             4

           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of cases,
           High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
           its view, because of the compromise between the
           offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
           case would put accused to great oppression and
           prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
           to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise
           with the victim. In other words, the High Court
           must consider whether it would be unfair or
           contrary to the interest of justice to continue with
           the criminal proceedings or continuation of the
           criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse
           of   process   of  law   despite   settlement   and
           compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
           and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
           appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
           and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
           affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
           jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that ultimately the dispute between

the parties has become         a monetary      dispute and that    was

settled between       them, no purpose will be served by allowing

the case continue on file as chances of conviction is remote

in view of the settlement arrived between the parties.

      8. This Court feels that it is a fit case where power under

Section 482 of the       Code of     Criminal Procedure       has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings. Hence, the application is

Crl.M.C.No.1086 of 2014           5

allowed and the further proceedings in C.C.No.231/12 on the

file of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri, as against the

petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned Magistrate court for further action.

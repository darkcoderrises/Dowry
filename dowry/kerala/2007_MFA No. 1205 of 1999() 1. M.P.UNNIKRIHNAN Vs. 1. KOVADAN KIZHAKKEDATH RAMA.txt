                   Dated 22nd August, 2007

                           JUDGMENT


Koshy,J.

         This appeal is filed by the husband against the

dismissal of the application filed under Section 13(1)(iii)(a)

of the Hindu Marriage Act.  It is his case that he married the

respondent on 17.8.1996 as per customary rites.    They lived

together only for one week.     The respondent behaved in an

indifferent  and  wild  manner.    She  was  taking  medicines

regularly.      Dr.O.K.Narayanan Kutty, Kannur informed the

appellant that since the last six years  the   respondent   is

suffering from mental disorder and taking medicines.   In any

event, their marital relationship was not cordial through out.

According to the respondent, demand of dowry was the reason

for the absence of cordial relationship.     The Family Court

found that the appellant was not able to prove that there is

mental disorder.   After filing of the appeal, several times

the case was posted for appearance of parties before this

court as well as Adalath, but, respondent was absent.  Learned

counsel  for  the   respondent  submitted  that  even   though

registered letter was sent, there is no response from the

respondent.  In any event, we are of the view that for the

last 12 years they were living separately and marriage is

MFA.1205/1999                2

irretrievably broken.   If the marriage is irretrievably

broken and both are not living together and not on talking

terms for years together, there is a mutual cruelty and

marriage can be dissolved under Section 13(1)(iii)(a) of

the Hindu Marriage Act.    Apex Court in Naveen Kohli v.

Neelu Kohli (AIR 2006 SC 1675) held that if the marriage is

irretrievably broken, there is no purpose in continuing the

relationship and divorce can be granted.



           Hence, this appeal is allowed and divorce is

granted under Section 13(1)(iii)(a) of the Hindu Marriage

Act.

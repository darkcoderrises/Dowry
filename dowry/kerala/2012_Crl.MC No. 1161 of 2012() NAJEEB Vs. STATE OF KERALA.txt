               Crl.M.C.No.1161 of 2012
          -----------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 3rd day of October, 2012

                        O R D E R



        Petitioners are the accused in a case

pending, numbered as C.C.No.1262 of 2012 on the

file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-

I, Kunnamangalam. They are being prosecuted for

the offence punishable under Section 498-A read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, on a

report filed in a crime registered on the

complaint of 2nd respondent imputing matrimonial

cruelty and harassment demanding dowry against

her by the husband, his in-laws and close

relatives. 1st petitioner is the husband of the 2nd

respondent.     Pending the criminal case, parties

have reached a settlement by which dissolution of

Crl.M.C.No.1161 of 2012

                         :: 2 ::



the marriage of the 1st petitioner and the 2nd

respondent has been brought into effect settling

all claims, is the submission of the learned

counsel for the petitioners. Annexure A2 has been

produced as evidence regarding the settlement

effected by the spouses to have termination of

their matrimonial relationship.       Submissions

made as above by the learned counsel for the

petitioners are endorsed by the learned counsel

for the 2nd respondent, who submits that, that

respondent/the de facto complainant is no longer

interested in prosecuting her husband and his

relatives.

            2. Learned counsel for the petitioners

and also the counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent, both submit that after termination of

the marriage, the 2nd respondent has married again

and in that relationship she has given birth to a

Crl.M.C.No.1161 of 2012

                           :: 3 ::



child as well.         In such circumstances where

settlement has already been effected and she is

now in a new matrimonial home compelling her to

appear before the court to prosecute the case

launched against her previous husband and his

relatives is likely to rupture and damage her

present peaceful life with the new husband.

Further more, since the offence imputed against

the petitioners has arisen from the matrimonial

disputes     of    the  1st   petitioner and the 2nd

respondent, it could also be considered as

personal and not affecting the public at large. In

the light of the settlement effected by the

parties, even if the prosecution is continued,

there is remote chance for conviction against any

of the accused and at best, such prosecution may

only result in wastage of time of the court.

            3. The offence imputed against the

Crl.M.C.No.1161 of 2012

                          :: 4 ::



petitioners is non-compoundable. Still, having

regard to the facts and circumstances and taking

note of the decision of the Apex Court in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab {2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)}, I

find, the ends of justice demand quashing of the

criminal proceedings against the petitioners/

accused in the above case.

            Criminal    proceedings       against   the

petitioners/accused in C.C.No.1262 of 2012 on the

file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-

I,  Kunnamangalam       are quashed       invoking  the

inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

                                            Sd/-

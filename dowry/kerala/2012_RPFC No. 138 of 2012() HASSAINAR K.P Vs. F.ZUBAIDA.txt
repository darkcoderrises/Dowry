                      R.P(FC). No.138 OF 2012
                 ==========================
                  Dated this the 2nd day of July, 2012


                                ORDER



       This revision petition has been filed against the order in

M.C.No.98 of 2011 on the file of the Family Court, Kasaragode. That

petition was filed by the first respondent herein under section 125(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking monthly maintenance for

herself and the minor child born in her wedlock with the petitioner.

Her contention was that the revision petitioner-respondent is a

drunkard and used to demand dowry. She came to know that he had

contracted another marriage. It is also contended that she is not able

to maintain herself and the child and that the revision petitioner who

is capable to maintaining her and the child born in their wedlock, is

neglecting to maintain them. The revision petitioner admitted that the

first respondent is his legally wedded wife and there is no dispute with

R.P.(F.C).138/12                    2



respect to the paternity of the child. According to him, after the birth

of the second respondent/second petitioner, the first respondent

started compelling the revision petitioner to shift the residence. Apart

from that, it is contended by the revision petitioner that the first

respondent is getting Rs.4,000/- from her tailoring work. No evidence

whatsoever was adduced by him to support the said contention. The

first respondent herein got examined as PW1 and the revision

petitioner was examined as RW1. After carefully considering the

rival contentions and on proper evaluation of the evidence, the Family

Court found that the respondents herein are not in a position to

maintain themselves and at the same time, the revision petitioner

being an able bodied and minded person, is capable of maintaining

them and he has been neglecting to maintain them.            Though the

petitioner has set up a defence that the first respondent herein is

getting monthly income of about Rs.4,000/- from her tailoring work,

he has not adduced evidence to prove that. There is no case for the

revision petitioner that he is not an able bodied person. The second

R.P.(F.C).138/12                     3



petitioner herein is studying in the VI standard.          It is after

consideration of all such relevant aspects that the Family Court fixed

the monthly maintenance @ Rs.1500/- per month to the first

respondent and @ Rs.750/- to the second respondent. Fixation of the

said monthly maintenance cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive.

In the circumstances, I do not find any compelling reason for

interference by exercising the revisional jurisdiction. This revision

petition is, therefore, liable to fail. Accordingly, it is dismissed.

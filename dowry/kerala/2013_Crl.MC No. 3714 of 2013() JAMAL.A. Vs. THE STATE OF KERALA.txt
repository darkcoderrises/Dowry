                Crl.M.C. No. 3714 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
        Dated this the 2nd day of September, 2013

                            ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in Crime No.448/2013

of Vidyanagar Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 294(b), 332, 452 and 506(ii) r/w

Section 149 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR

and all further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime

No.448/2013 of Vidyanagar Police Station as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.    The allegation leveled against the accused in the

above crime is that on 25/7/2013 at about 10.35 p.m., the

accused after forming themselves into an unlawful assembly

trespassed into the Kerala State Electricity Board Section

Office at Cherkala in Chengala Village and assaulted the

defacto complainant. When the Assistant Engineer attempted

to   prevent   the   accused   from   assaulting  the    defacto

complainant he was pushed out. The accused also thrown

away the mobile phone and office phone. Thus, according to

Crl.M.C. No. 3714 of 2013
                               2

the accused has committed the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 294(b), 332, 452 and 506(ii) r/w

Section 149 of I.P.C. Now, according to the petitioner, the

entire disputes is settled with the respondents 2 and 3. The

second respondent who is the defacto complainant and also

the 3rd respondent had respectively sworn into Annexures A3

and A4 affidavit to the above effect.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case , the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above         case.  Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received    from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

Crl.M.C. No. 3714 of 2013
                                3

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 294(b),

332, 452 and 506(ii) r/w Section 149       of I.P.C., which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case,

Crl.M.C. No. 3714 of 2013
                                      4

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

Crl.M.C. No. 3714 of 2013
                                    5

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite         full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

                               6

Annexure-A1 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No.448/2013 of Vidyanagar Police Station

and all further proceedings thereto.

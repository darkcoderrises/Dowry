            Dated this the 6th day of June, 2008

                          O R D E R


           The petitioner, who is the sole accused in

C.C.No.475 of 2004 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Attingal, approached this Court under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a

prayer to quash all proceedings pending against him as

C.C.No.475 of 2004.

      2.   C.C.No.475 of 2004, the case in which the

petitioner/accused is facing charge for the offence under

Section 120B, 498(A)and 323 of I.P.C. is the continuation

of the proceedings of the court in Crime No.432 of 2001.

Crime No.432 of 2001 was registered in the Attingal Police

Station on the basis of the complaint received under

Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the

Judicial  First   Class     Magistrate,       Attingal.   After

investigation, the Police had filed a report on the basis of

which the court took cognisance and instituted C.C.No.335

of 2002.    That case was finally disposed of as per

Crl.M.C NO.3510 of 2004

                            :-2-:

judgment dated 9.7.2004 of the court below, a copy of

the said judgment is produced along with this Crl.M.C.

as Annexure-A2. As the petitioner was not available for

trial, the case against him was split up and refiled as

C.C.No.475 of 2004. It is the above proceedings now he

challenged in this proceedings. Originally, there were

altogether six accused including the relatives of the

petitioner. There, the allegation was that the petitioner

herein married the de facto complainant and the

marriage was solemnised on 8.10.1995 at about 12.30

p.m in accordance with the rituals and customs

prevailing in the Muslim community. Thereafter, from

the date of marriage onwards, the accused has been

harassing the de facto complainant both mentally and

physically. It is also the case of the complainant that the

accused had entered into criminal conspiracy so as to

oust the de facto complainant and her children from the

company of the first accused and attacked her and

inflicted injuries on 26.4.2001. Therefore, according to

the de facto complainant and the Police, the accused

Crl.M.C NO.3510 of 2004

                           :-3-:

seven in numbers have committed the offences

punishable under Sections 120B, 498(A )and 323 I.P.C.

      3.   After investigation, the Police filed a report

on the basis of which the trial has taken place during

which Pws.1 to 4 were examined and Ext.P1 was

marked.     During the cross examination,      CW1 was

examined as PW2 and she deposed that though there

was some dispute between herself and the first accused,

the accused persons have not harassed the petitioner

mentally and physically by demanding more money as

dowry. She had also deposed before the court that she

had no complaint against the accused persons and she

had filed a compromise petition before the court. The

other witnesses namely Pws.2 to 4 turned hostile to the

prosecution. Therefore, finally the court below found

that there is nothing in evidence to connect the accused

for offence alleged against them and accordingly, the

court below came to the conclusion that the prosecution

has failed to establish the case against the accused

Nos.1 to 5 and 7 and accordingly, they were found not

Crl.M.C NO.3510 of 2004

                           :-4-:

guilty of the offences alleged against them and

acquitted.

      4.   The petitioner submits that he was out of

station in connection with his job and he could not

appear during the trial of the case. It is also submitted

that the matter was settled out of court. Therefore, it is

prayed that the proceedings pending against the

petitioner may be quashed.

      5.   I have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

Counsel for the petitioner submits that going by

Annexure A2 judgment, it can be seen that the matter

has been compromised and settled out of court and a

compounding petition was filed before the court below

as evidenced by Annexure A2 judgment. Therefore, as

the matter has been settled, it is highly unjust to

relegate the petitioner to face the trial and no purpose

will be served. On the other hand, the learned Public

Prosecutor relied on a Full Bench decision of this Court

reported in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006(1)

Crl.M.C NO.3510 of 2004

                          :-5-:

KLT 552) (F.B.). Learned counsel for the petitioner on

the strength of the decision of the Supreme Court

reported in B.S.Joshi v. State of Haryana (AIR 2003

SC 1386) = (2003(2) KLT 1062(SC)) and decision of this

Court reported in Thankamma v. State of Kerala

(2006(3) KLT 846), submits that since the matrimonial

dispute has been settled by the parties thereto, there is

no meaning in directing the petitioner to undergo the

ordeal of trial. The Full Bench decision of this Court

cited by the learned Public Prosecutor has no

application in the present case as the facts and

circumstances of the case involved in the present case

are entirely different.

      6.   Here, it is a case where the de facto

complainant herself deposed before the court below that

the matrimonial dispute between the parties has been

settled and she does not want to proceed further with

the case. On a perusal of Annexure-AI deposition, it can

be seen that she had categorically stated that the

petitioner is in noway involved in the offence. It is also

Crl.M.C NO.3510 of 2004

                             :-6-:

clear from Annexure-A2 judgment that all the main

allegations are against the in-laws of the de facto

complainant and not against the petitioner herein. If

that be so and also in the light of the decision of this

Court as well as the Apex Court, I am of the view that no

purpose will be served in allowing to continue the

proceedings.

      7.  In    the    light of   the above   facts  and

circumstances, I am of the view that for the ends of

justice, this petition can be allowed and accordingly,

C.C.No.475 of 2004 and all proceedings therein pending

against the petitioner before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Attingal are quashed.

           This Crl.M.C. is accordingly allowed.

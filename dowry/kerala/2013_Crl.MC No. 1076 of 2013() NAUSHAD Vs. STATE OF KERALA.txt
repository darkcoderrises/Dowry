                        Crl.M.C.No. 1076 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 21st day of June, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                    The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.218 of 2010 of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, which is a case instituted upon the police

report in Crime No.2820 of 2010 of the Ernakulam Central Police Station

for the offences punishable under Section 63 of the Copy Right Act,1957

and Section 420 of the I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A2 final

report filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam in

C.C.No.218 of 2010, as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that the petitioner

manufactured cooling glasses and stocked the same showing them as

original Ray Ban cooling glasses and thereby cheated the company, which

is manufacturing the original Ray Ban glasses, with fraudulent intention to

get pecuniary advantage and with the same intention, forged seal is

Crl.M.C.No.1076 of 2013

                                      :-2-:

implanted in the glass made by him and thus he stocked 15 cooling glasses

in his institution and thereby committed the offences punishable under

Section 63 of the Copy Right Act,1957 and 420 I.P.C. Now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who is the de

facto complainant, on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent, submitted that the above respondent does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioner and he has no grievance against

them.

         6.    I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

Crl.M.C.No.1076 of 2013

                                    :-3-:

respective counsel. Annexure A4 affidavit is filed by the de facto

complainant. I have verified the documents and materials produced along

with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

Section 63 of the Copy Right Act,1957 and 420 I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

Crl.M.C.No.1076 of 2013

                                          :-4-:

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                   "57.     The position that emerges from the above

          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High

          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint

          in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

          from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

          offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process

          of any Court.       In what cases power to quash the criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the

          offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such

          like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

          resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

Crl.M.C.No.1076 of 2013

                                        :-5-:

          of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

          of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

          prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite         full and complete

          settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

                                   :-6-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -A2

final report filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam in

C.C.No.218 of 2010.

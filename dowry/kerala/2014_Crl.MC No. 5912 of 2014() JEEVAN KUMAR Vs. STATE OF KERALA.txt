                     Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014
                   ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 24th day of October, 2014.

                              O R D E R



      The case set up in impugned Annexure-1 FIR in Crime

No.1236/2014 of Payyannur Police Station, Kannur District is that

the accused therein (A1 to A3/Petitioners 1 to 3) and five other

identifiable persons on 29.4.2014 at 20:00 hrs, form themselves

into unlawful assembly with an intention to assault 2nd

respondent, trespassed into the house and thereafter they had

taken the 2nd respondent in Alto car to a far away place at Korome

and they had assaulted the 2nd respondent with hands and also

with a harmful road and thereafter the 2nd respondent was taken

to Payyannur and left him there and 2nd respondent also lost his

mobile phone and the petitioners are having enmity to 2nd

respondent since the 2nd respondent had eloped with the wife of

the 3rd petitioner (Aneesh Kumar K.), that during the time when

2nd respondent was so assaulted, his mother, 3rd respondent

herein, had interfered and she too sustained injuries and

hospitalised etc. It is the case of the petitioners that they never

assaulted the 2nd & 3rd respondents as alleged.            The 2nd

respondent is the defacto complainant in Annexure-1. It is stated

that one Smt.Neethu is the wife of 3rd petitioner-Aneesh and that

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

the said couple have a two year old son (Surya Raj). It is stated

in the petition that the 2nd respondent herein (defacto

complainant in Annexure-1 Crime) had eloped with the above

said Neethu and her two year old son and after so eloping on

17.9.2014, the 2nd respondent together with Neethu and child

were roaming at different places and thereafter on 24.9.2013

Smt.Neethu together with the child had surrendered before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur where her

statement was recored that she had gone along with the 2nd

respondent.    Petitioners 1, 2 & 4 are the brothers of the 3rd

petitioner. Petitioners 5 to 8 are the friends and neighbours of

other petitioners. It is stated that Neethu and her child after

surrendering before the Magistrate have gone to her house and

she started residing along with her parents. It is stated that the

entire matter was discussed between the petitioners and

contesting respondents and with the help of the others all issues

have been settled amicably and respondents 2 & 3, who are said

to be injured in the crime, have sworn to affidavit as per

Annexure 2 & 3 stating that the entire disputes have been settled

between the petitioners and contesting respondents. Annexure-2

is the affidavit sworn to by the 2nd respondent on 7.10.2014 and

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

Annexure-3 is the affidavit sworn by the 3rd respondent on

7.10.2014. It is stated therein by the contesting respondents

that the matter has been settled between the petitioner and the

contesting respondents and they are not interested any more to

continue   the  impugned    criminal  proceedings    against the

petitioners and that the impugned criminal proceedings against

the contesting respondents be terminated.     It is in the light of

these facts and circumstances that the petitioners have filed this

Crl.M.C seeking invocation of the inherent powers vested on this

Court under Sec. 482 Cr.P.C with the prayer to quash the

impugned criminal proceedings in Annexure-1 FIR in Crime

No.1236/2012 of Payyannur Police Station and all further

proceedings arising therefrom.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.P.S.Binu,

Advocate, has taken notice for respondents 2 & 3 and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st  respondent-State

of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.Philjo Varughese Philip, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.P.S.Binu, learned counsel

appearing for respondents 2 & 3 and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

                                ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

      4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both parties as the

real disputants to the controversy have arrived at an amicable

settlement and any further continuation of the criminal

proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and money

and would unnecessarily strain the judicial, administrative and

financial resources of the State.

      5.    Sri.P.S.Binu,   learned    counsel    appearing     for

respondents 2 & 3 has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by respondents 2 & 3 that they         have

amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and that they

have no objection in the quashment of the impugned criminal

proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as they

have no grievance against the petitioners and that they will not

raise any dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing

the impugned final report is allowed.

                                 ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

      6.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case in

the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature.

The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such offences are

involved, the real disputants to the controversy, which has led to

the impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for respondents 2 & 3, it is clear to the

Court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at by them.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court

has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014


               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may     quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
       public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

                                ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.5912 Of 2014

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by

granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-1 FIR in Crime No.1236/2014 of Payyannur Police

Station, Kannur District against all the accused and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stands quashed. The petitioners

shall forward certified copies of this order to the Station House

Officer concerned as well as before the court below concerned.




                                            ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                    Judge.

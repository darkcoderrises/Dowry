               ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.1775 of 2012
               ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 7 in C.C.No.3387 of

2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakuda

which is a case instituted upon a complaint filed by the first

respondent for the offences punishable under Sections 143,

147, 148, 323, 324 & 326 read with Section 149 of IPC and 27

of Arms Act, 1959 with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings in Annexure A1 F.I.R. and final report pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.3387 of 2011 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakuda as the

matter is settled out of court.

     2.     The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioners/accused    had attacked respondents 1 to 3 at a

temple premises due to personal animosity on a festival day

Crl.M.C.No.1775/2012

                              :-2-:

and now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

out of court.

      3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition which is

Crl.M.C.No.1775/2012

                             :-3-:

marked as Annexure-AV affidavit.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,

324 & 326 read with Section 149 of IPC and 27 of Arms Act,

1959 which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the first

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

Crl.M.C.No.1775/2012

                                              :-4-:

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                       "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

Crl.M.C.No.1775/2012

                                            :-5-:

         this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

         its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled

the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

Crl.M.C.No.1775/2012

                             :-6-:

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

Annexure A1 F.I.R. and final report pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.3387 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakuda.

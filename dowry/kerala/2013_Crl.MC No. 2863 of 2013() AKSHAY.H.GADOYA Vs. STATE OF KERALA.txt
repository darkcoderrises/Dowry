                 Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 15th day of July, 2013


                           O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioner, who is the 1st accused in C.C.No.704/2006

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, North Paravur,

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No.38/2006 of Eloor Police Station] for the offences

punishable under Sections 408, 409, r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash all proceedings in the above calendar case,

as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.    The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner who was working as Branch Manager of

M/s.Servo Packages had committed breach of trust and

amassed money belonging to the Company by falsely

intimating the Company that the plastic gunny bags supplied

Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
                            :-2-:

by the Company to FACT, Eloor, were defective and

thereafter without sending back the gunny bags to the

company had sold the same to third parties and obtained

money thereby causing financial loss to the complainant.

Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

between himself and the de facto complainant, as evident

from Annexure A3 affidavit sworn in by the de facto

complainant, who is the 2nd respondent herein.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case.      Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
                              :-3-:

on the basis of specific instruction received from the 2nd

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against him.

         6.    I    have carefully  considered   the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 408,

409, r/w 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
                                  :-4-:

note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/1st accused in the light of the settlement arrived

by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts

Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
                                  :-5-:

         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

Crl.M.C.No.2863 of 2013
                              :-6-:

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioner in

C.C.No 704/2006 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, North Paravur in Crime No.38/2006 of Eloor Police

Station.

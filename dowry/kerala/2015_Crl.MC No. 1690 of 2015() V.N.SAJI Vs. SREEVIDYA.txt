                CRL.M.C. No.1690 of 2015
           =========================
            Dated this the 31st day of March, 2015

                         O R D E R


     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.459 of 2013 of

the Palakkad Town North Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report in

Crime No.459 of 2013 of the Palakkad Town North Police

Station as against the petitioner and all further proceedings

based on it in C.C.No.99 of 2013 pending before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Palakkad, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.1690 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,    who   is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.1690 of 2015
                               -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A

Final Report in Crime No.459 of 2013 of the Palakkad Town

North Police Station as against the petitioner and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.99 of 2013 pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Palakkad, are

hereby quashed.

                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 725 of 2015
             =======================
             Dated this the 3rd day of March, 2015

                            O R D E R



     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.956 of 2013 of the

Kollengode Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-1 Final Report in Crime

No.956 of 2013 of the Kollengode Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.4033 of 2013 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Chittur, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

Crl.M.C. No. 725 of 2015
                                  2

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.                She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.     Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 3rd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

Crl.M.C. No. 725 of 2015
                                   3

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioners, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-1 Final

Report in Crime No.956 of 2013 of the Kollengode Police Station

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.4033 of 2013

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Chittur, are hereby quashed.

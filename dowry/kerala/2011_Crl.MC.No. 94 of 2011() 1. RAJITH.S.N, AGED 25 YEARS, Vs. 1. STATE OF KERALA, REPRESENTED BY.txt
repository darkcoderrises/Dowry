            ====================================
              Dated this the 20th day of June, 2011


                            O R D E R



      Petitioner seeks to quash          Annexure-13, report dated

17.09.2010 submitted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Kadakkal

before the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Kottarakkara

in Crime No.1319 of 2010 reporting that in the said case originally

registered under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(for short, "the Code"), offence under Section 304B of the Indian

Penal Code (short, "the IPC") is revealed and hence the section of

offence in the FIR is altered accordingly.        Learned counsel

contends that no such offence could be attributed to the petitioner

in that there is no case or any material to show that petitioner is

the husband of the deceased.      Learned counsel has referred me

to various documents produced along with this petition. I have

heard   learned Public Prosecutor also      and learned counsel for

additional second respondent.

      2.    One Raji Sivan      consumed poison while allegedly

staying with petitioner, at his residence on 26.08.2010 and while

undergoing treatment at the hospital she died on 06.09.2010. The

CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                  -: 2 :-


Police registered Annexure-3, FIR under Sec.174 of the Code and

started      investigation.   Annexure-12 is the inquest report

prepared by the police.       On the materials collected by the

Investigating    Officer,  he    submitted  Annexure-13,    report

incorporating Sec.304B of the IPC in the FIR. It is contended by

learned counsel that records produced would show that there was

a valid marriage between the deceased and one Lejin subsisting

at the time of her death on 06.09.2010 and hence petitioner

cannot be said to be the husband of deceased so as to attract

offence under Sec.304B of the IPC.           Learned counsel for

additional    second respondent has contended that to attract

Sec.304B, IPC a valid marriage is not necessary. It is also argued

that living together as husband and wife raises a presumption of

valid marriage.

      3.    It is not disputed that the deceased had been married

to Lejin and she had initiated proceeding against the said Lejin

and others for offence punishable under Sec.498A of the IPC.

Annexure-3 is the FIR in crime No.366 of 2008 of Kdakkal police

registered on 12.06.2008 against the said Lejin and his relatives

for offence     under section 498A read with 34 of the IPC.

Annexure-4 is the final report in       the said case where the

Investigating Officer came to the conclusion that Lejin and others

committed the said offence. That case went for trial and the

CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                    -: 3 :-


deceased herself gave evidence. Annexure-5 is the photocopy of

her deposition. She claimed that Lejin is her husband and their

marriage was solemnized on            07.02.2007 (according to the

learned counsel the marriage was on 07.02.2008). Annexure-6 is

the photocopy of deposition of         mother of the deceased and

Annexure-7 is      the deposition of witness for the prosecution.

They have also referred to the marriage of the deceased, Raji

Sivan with Lejin. Annexure-8 is the photocopy of the deposition

of the Uncle of the deceased. That deposition was recorded on

26.10.2010, i.e., after the death of Raji Sivan on 06.09.2010. In

Annexure-8, Uncle of the deceased stated that she was married

to Lejin on 02.02.2008.     It is thus evident that as on the date of

death of Raji Sivan there was a valid marriage subsisting with

Lejin.   Annexure-12 is the inquest report where one of the

witnesses is seen to have stated that the deceased was staying

with petitioner for sometime and that he was harassing her with

demand to sell the 70 cents of land belonging to her, was

constantly ill-treating her and unable to bear the ill-treatment she

consumed poison.

      4.    Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that if not

Sec.304B of the IPC, offence under Sec.306 of the IPC is made out

in that there are sufficient materials to show that petitioner was

harassing the deceased with demand for sale of her property

CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                -: 4 :-


and in that circumstance she committed suicide which according

to the learned Public prosecutor attracted offence under Sec.306

of the IPC.   Learned counsel for additional second respondent

also raised the same argument. Alternatively it is argued that

even if there was no valid marriage between petitioner and the

deceased that did not take the case       out of the purview of

Sec.304B or Sec.498A of the IPC.      Reliance is placed on the


decisions of the Supreme Court in      Reema Aggarwal v.

Anupam (AIR 2004 SC 1418) and Koppisetti Subbharao

@ Asubramanian v. State of A.P. (AIR 2009 SC 2684).

      5.    Annexure-13, report which is under challenge is to the

effect that Sec.304B of the IPC is incorporated in the FIR. That

provision deals with dowry death and says that where the death

of woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs

otherwise than under normal circumstances within "7 years of her

marriage" and it is shown that soon before her death she was

subjected to cruelty or harassment "by her husband or any

relative of her husband" for, or in connection with any demand

for "dowry" such death shall be called dowry death and "such

husband or relative" shall be deemed to have caused her death.

Explanation says that for the purpose of sub-sec.(1) "dowry" shall

have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition

CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                   -: 5 :-


Act (for short, "the Act').

      6.    As per the above section the person who is liable for

punishment is the       husband or any of his relative and the

expression "dowry" must be given the meaning given in Sec.2 of

the   Act.  In   Sec.2 of the said Act dowry is defined as         any

property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either

directly or indirectly by one party to a "marriage" to the other

party to the "marriage" or by the parent of either party to a

"marriage" or by any other person to either party to the

"marriage" or to any other person. Thus going by Sec.2 of the

Act and Sec.304B of the IPC it is clear that the person who could

be proceeded against is either the husband of the woman whose

death occurred in circumstances otherwise than under normal

circumstances within 7 years of the marriage and any relative of

husband. Prima facie it appears that there must be a marriage

between the deceased and the person accused or his relative of

the offence.

      7.    True the Supreme Court in the above decisions stated

that the degree of proof required to prove a marriage for the purpose

of Sec.304B is not as stringent as in a claim of civil right, right to

property, etc. The dictum laid down is that so far as the offence under

Secs.498A and 304B of the IPC are concerned it would be

appropriate to consider the expression "husband" to cover a person

CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                    -: 6 :-


who enters into marital relationship and under the colour of such

proclaimed or feigned status of a husband subjects the woman to

cruelty or coerces her in any manner or for any of the purposes

enumerated to in Sec.304B or Sec.498A of the IPC.

      8.     Those decisions have to be understood on the peculiar

facts and circumstances of the case where it was not contended that

there was any valid marriage subsisting between the woman and

anybody other than the accused. Parties before me are Hindus and

a second marriage when the first marriage is subsisting is null and

void.   I referred to the various Annexures produced by petitioner

which would show that even as on date of death of Raji Sivan she

had a valid marriage subsisting with Legin, accused in Crime No.366

of 2008 of Kdakkal Police Station and C.C. No.1595 of 2008 of the

court of learned Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kottarakkara. It is

pertinent to note that the father of deceased stuck to that case of the

deceased even when he was examined in court after the death of

the deceased.     If that be so, question of there being a marriage of

any sort between petitioner and deceased so that the case could be

brought within the ambit of Sec.304B of the IPC does not arise. I am

persuaded to accept the contention of learned counsel for petitioner

that there is no scope for application of Sec.304B of the IPC.

      9.     As such Annexure-13, report implicating petitioner for

 CRL.M.C. No.94 of 2011
                                   -: 7 :-


offence punishable under Sec.304B of the IPC cannot stand and is

liable to be quashed. I do so. But I make it clear that it is open to the

investigating agency to look into the question whether petitioner has

committed any other offence and if so proceed in the matter as

provided under law.

       Resultantly, Criminal Miscellaneous Case is              allowed.

Annexure-13,     report is quashed for the reasons I have stated

above. But I make it clear that it is open to the Investigating

Agency to look into whether petitioner has committed any other

offence in relation to the death of the deceased and if so, proceed

in the matter as provided under law.

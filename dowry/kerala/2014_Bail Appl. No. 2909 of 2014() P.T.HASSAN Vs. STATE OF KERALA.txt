               Dated this the 25th day of April, 2014

                             O R D E R



     The petitioners are accused Nos.2 to 5 in Crime No.217

of 2014 of Thiruvazhiyode Police Station.

     2. The offence alleged against the petitioners is under

Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code.

     3. Crime was registered on the basis of a complaint by

one Haseena, wife of Mohammed, who is the 1st accused in

the case. Haseena was married to the 1st accused in January

2009 and they fell apart.                  The complainant alleges

harassment and demand for dowry which had given rise to

the above case.

     4. The learned Public Prosecutor opposes the above

allegation on the ground that if the accused are not arrested

and detained, the investigation cannot proceed further.

     5. Having regard to the nature of the allegation and

B.A.No.2909 of 2014           2

the offences involved in the matter, I am of the view that the

custodial interrogation of the present petitioners are not

required. In the result, application for anticipatory bail can

be allowed on the following conditions:

          1.    The petitioners shall appear before the

     Investigating Officer on every Tuesday at 10 a.m.

     until they are relieved from the responsibility of

     appearing before the Investigating Officer.

          2.     In the event of being arrested, the

     petitioners shall be released on bail on executing a

     bond for `10,000/- (Rupees Ten thousand only)

     each with two solvent sureties each for the like

     amount.

          3.     If the Investigating Officer feels that

     custodial interrogation is required for proceeding

     with the investigation of the above case it shall be

     open for the Investigating Officer to approach the

B.A.No.2909 of 2014         3

      learned Magistrate and seek appropriate direction

      for the same.

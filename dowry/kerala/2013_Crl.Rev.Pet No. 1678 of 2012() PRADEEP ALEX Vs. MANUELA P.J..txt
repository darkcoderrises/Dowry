               ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                           ORDER




          The Revision Petitioners are appellant      Nos. 1

and 2 in Criminal Appeal No.288/2011 on the files of the

court of Additional Sessions Judge, Kollam as well as

respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in Criminal M.P.No. 9997/2010 on

the files of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First

Class-III, Punalur. 1st Revision Petitioner is the husband of

the 1st respondent and 2nd        Revision Petitioner is the

mother of the 1st Revision Petitioner. The 1st respondent

herein had filed an application under Section 12 of the

Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005

(for short, 'DV Act') before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-III, Punalur.     She had filed an interim

application under Section 23(2) of the DV Act seeking

interim reliefs under Sections 18,19,20 and 22 of the

above Act. After considering the averments in the interim

application as well as in the objection, the learned

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012        2

Magistrate granted an interim residence order under

Section 19 of the Act restraining the Revision Petitioners

from dispossessing or any other manner disturbing the

possession of the respondent from the shared house hold

by name Vayalumkal House, Punalur until further orders.

So also a protection order was also passed under Section

18 of the Act restraining the Revision Petitioners from

committing any act of domestic violence, prohibiting from

entering into the work place of the 1st respondent,

prohibiting from stopping the 1st respondent from going to

her place of employment, prohibiting alienation of assets

and any kind of violence against the dependents and

relatives of the 1st respondent until further orders.

             2. Aggrieved by the said order though       the

Revision Petitioners filed the Criminal Appeal, after re-

appreciating the materials on record, the learned Sessions

Judge also confirmed the interim order passed by the

Learned Magistrate . This order is under challenge in this

Revision Petition. In the interim application it is the case

of the 1st respondent that her marriage with the 1st

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012         3

Revision Petitioner was solemnized on 5/3/2006 and a

male child was borne out of that wedlock. At the time of

marriage the 1st respondent was employed at Government

Higher Secondary School, Cochin as a teacher. The

Revision Petitioners have managed to obtain a sum of

Rs.2,27,500/-(Rupees Two Lakhs Twenty Seven Thousand

and Five Hundred only) from the respondent          and her

parents towards dowry and thereafter she was compelled

to part with a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/-(Rupees Two Lakhs

Fifty Thousand only) which was earned by the respondent

from her job.          The 1st Revision Petitioner allegedly

obtained an amount of Rs.10,80,000/-(Rupees Ten Lakhs

Eighty Thousand only) and 65 sovereigns of gold

ornaments from her          and misappropriated the said

amount and gold ornaments and thereafter treated her

with cruelty demanding to alienate          her 8 cents of

property. It is also alleged that the 1st Revision Petitioner

is having an illicit relationship with one lady by name Mini

and she along with her relatives came to her place of

employment and ridiculed her several times. She filed a

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012          4

complaint under section 498 A read with section 34 IPC

and crime was registered as crime No. 85/2008 of Punalur

Police Station.        The 1st Revision Petitioner filed OP

(divorce) 1334/10 before the Family Court Ernakulam

against the respondent.       The specific allegation is that

the Revision Petitioners are not permitting her and the

child to reside in the shared house hold. Therefore she

sought for interim order enabling her to live in the shared

household.

             3. The Revision Petitioners filed an objection

admitting the marriage and paternity of the child, but

denying all the allegations levelled against them.

According to them,        the respondent had shifted their

residence to a rented house at Karavaloor.          After the

marriage the Revision Petitioners came to know that the

1st respondent was taking medicines for mental illness.

The 1st Revision Petitioner had preferred a divorce OP

before the Family Court, Ernakulam and the present

petition is filed vindictively in retaliation of the said O.P.

without bona fides.

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012       5

             4. The learned counsel for the Revision

Petitioners submits that in fact there is no need to reside

in the shared household as she is employed at Alappuzha.

Now she is residing at her parental home at Cochin and

the shared house hold is situating at Punalur far away

from the place of employment. So, this petition was filed

vindictively to wreak vengeance only.      She herself had

already written a letter to the mother-in-law intimating

that she does not intend to reside in the house of the

Revision Petitioners.

             5. Per contra, the learned counsel for the

respondent submits that though she is employed at

Alappuzha, at the time of fling the interim application she

was residing in the shared household.        She wants to

reside in the shared household in holidays. So also after

the marriage she was residing in the shared household

and thereby she acquired the right to reside in the said

house peacefully and so also has the right to exercise that

right.

             6. In view of the rival contensions, the only

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012          6

question to be considered is that whether there is any

illegality or impropriety in the judgment under challenge.

Going by the averments,           it is seen that after the

marriage the 1st Revision Petitioner and the respondent

were resided         together in the Vayalumkal   house at

Punalur and the same stand as an admitted fact. At the

time of filing the application she was working at Punnala

from where she can go to Punalur on every day. Though

she is now employed at Alappuzha her employment is a

transferable one. I am of the opinion that merely on the

reason that        she is employed at Alappuzha, she cannot

be deprived of her right to reside in the matrimonial home

where she resided          a considerable period after the

marriage.          The learned counsel for the Revision

Petitioners submitted that she herself wrote a letter

indicating her desire not to live in the shared household,

but, as rightly pointed out by the appellate court, I am

also of the opinion that the letter written by the

respondent to her mother-in-law can not be taken as a

ground to dis allow the relief under section 19 of the Act.

Crl.R.P.No.1678 OF 2012          7

Though the Revision Petitioners contended that the house

belongs to the father of the 1st Revision Petitioner, no

document had been produced to establish the said

contention.       After considering the rival contention, the

learned Magistrate was satisfied with the need of granting

an interim relief till the disposal of the case. Though the

said order was challenged in appeal the learned Sessions

Judge also satisfied with the need as well as the right

claimed by the 1st respondent.

             Nevertheless,    considering   the   facts  and

circumstances of the case, the nature of the order passed

and the reasonings made for the same, I do not find any

kind of reason to interfere       with the impugned orders

passed concurrently. Consequently, this Revision Petition

is devoid of merit and dismissed accordingly. I direct the

learned Magistrate to dispose of the case as early as

possible.

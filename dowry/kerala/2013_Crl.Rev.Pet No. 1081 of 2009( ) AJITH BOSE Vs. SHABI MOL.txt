                          O R D E R


           These   criminal    revision  petitions  are   filed

challenging the order passed in Crl.M.C.No.67 of 2007 on

the files of the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Thiruvananthapuram by the petitioner and respondent

respectively in the above case. The parties are referred to

as in the M.C. The above M.C was filed under Sec.12 of the

Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act claiming

reliefs under Sec.18, 19, 20 and 22 of the Act.            The

petitioner is the legally wedded wife of the respondent and

their marriage was solemnised on 07/02/2006.             After

marriage, they were resided together at the residence of

the respondent.     Gold ornaments weighing 25 sovereigns

were given her at the time of marriage by her parents.

But, the petitioner was subjected to cruelty and harassment

on demand of more gold ornaments and money. Due to the

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               2

assault of the respondent, she had an abortion. When the

harassment became intolerable, she returned to her home

on 22/11/2006. At the request of the respondent, she again

came back on 03/03/2007.       But the harassment was again

continued and she was constrained to leave the matrimonial

home and now the marital relationship has been broken

irretrievably.      She prayed for an order directing the

respondent to pay monthly maintenance allowance @ 

5,000/- to her, to return the gold ornaments retained by the

respondent, to pay an amount of  2,00,000/- by the

respondent towards the expenses for marriage met by her

parents and to direct the payment of an amount of 

5,00,000/- towards compensation for cruelty and mental

harassment meted out to her by the respondent. It is also

prayed for preventing the respondent to enter into the place

of residence of the petitioner and to direct the return of

dress materials and articles belonged to the petitioner

which were allegedly kept in the house of the respondent.

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                                3

      2.   The respondent filed an objection admitting the

marriage and contended that at the time of marriage, the

petitioner was given only 102 gms of gold ornaments and

that was returned to her after obtaining receipt from the

petitioner. The respondent or his relatives never harassed

or ill-treated the petitioner. The abortion was carried out at

the instigation of the petitioner without the consent of the

counter petitioner.     He never wanted any dowry or any

other things. He is earning only  6,000/- per month as an

employee in the Sub Registrar office and he had to look

after his parents with this amount. Since the petitioner was

suffering from mental illness, he filed a petition for divorce

and the same is pending before the Family Court.           He

prayed for dismissal of the application as the petitioner is

not entitled to get any reliefs claimed in the petition.

      3.   The petitioner was examined as PW1 and one

witness was examined as PW2 and Exts.P1 to P6 were

marked.      The respondent was examined as DW1 and

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               4

Exts.D1 was marked.      One court witness was examined as

CW1 and Ext.C1 was marked as court exhibit.           After

considering both sides of evidence adduced by the

petitioner and the respondent respectively, the trial court

passed    an   order   restraining    the   respondent from

committing any act of domestic violence against the

petitioner and also to pay an amount of  2,000/- per month

to the petitioner towards her maintenance allowance from

the date of petition and rejected all other claims.

     4.   Aggrieved by the rejection of reliefs claimed, the

petitioner filed Crl.A.No.406 of 2008 and aggrieved by the

reliefs granted, the respondent filed Crl.A.No.404 of 2008

before the Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram. After re-

appreciating the evidence on record, the learned Sessions

Judge confirmed the order passed by the learned Chief

Judicial Magistrate and both appeals were dismissed. Both

revision petitions are filed against the common judgment

passed in the above two appeals.

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               5




     5.  The learned counsel for the   petitioner advanced

arguments assailing the findings by which claims for 25

sovereigns of gold ornaments and compensation of  5,000/-

were rejected and the learned counsel for the respondent

advanced arguments assailing granting of maintenance

allowance and the order restraining him from committing

any act of domestic violence.

     6.  In view of the rival contentions, the only question

to be considered is whether there is any illegality,

irregularity or perversity in the impugned judgment under

challenge.   The marriage and the fact that they are living

separately from 2007 onwards are admitted.        It is also

admitted that criminal complaint filed by the petitioner

against the respondent alleging offence under Sec.498(A)

read with Sec.34 Indian Penal Code is pending before the

Magistrate's court and OP (HMA) 976 of 2007 filed by the

respondent seeking divorce is pending before the Family

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               6

Court, Thiruvananthapuram.          Therefore, it could be

presumed that the marriage is irretrievably broken.         It

follows that there are sufficient grounds to reside

separately without forfeiting the right to claim maintenance

allowance from the respondent. The petitioner is a Junior

Advocate enrolled in the year 2007 only.         There is no

evidence to prove that she gets any earnings from her

profession.   The respondent himself has no case that the

petitioner has any other sources of income to maintain

herself. Now, she is depending upon her parents for her

livelihood. But, the respondent is working as a L.D.Clerk in

the Registration Department. When the respondent was

examined as DW1, he deposed that he gets a monthly salary

of  6,000/-. Taking into account the needs of the petitioner

and the status of life enjoyed by her, it cannot be state that

the claim for  5,000/- is excessive or unjust. But, at the

same time, it is proved that the respondent is working as a

L.D. Clerk and his only sources of income is his monthly

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               7

salary. There is no evidence to show that he had any other

sources of income.       It is an admitted fact that the

respondent is a dumb person also.     It is also come out in

evidence that the respondent had to look after his parents

also.

     7.   Having regard to the standard of life and living

cost of the petitioner and the income of the respondent, I

am also of the opinion that the quantum of  2,000/- per

month fixed by the court below and confirmed by the

appellate court is just and proper. Coming to the claim of

returning of gold ornaments weighing 25 sovereigns, the

court below concurrently rejected the said claim in the

absence of entrustment of gold ornaments weighing 25

sovereigns,    in view of Ext.D1 receipt issued by the

petitioner evidencing return of 102 gms. of gold ornaments

by the respondent.    In Ext.D1, it has been stated that the

gold ornaments weighing 102 gms. were given to her by her

parents at the time of marriage.      It is pertinent to note

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               8

that the recital in Ext.D1 do not contain any material to

infer that gold ornaments weighing 25 sovereigns were

given to the petitioner by her parents     at the time of her

marriage. However, petitioner raised the contention that

those gold ornaments were subsequently given back to the

respondent when she was taken back to the matrimonial

home by the respondent. There is no evidence to support

the said contention.    Thus, the available evidence proved

that she had being given 102 gms. of gold ornaments at the

time of marriage and the same was returned by Ext.D1

receipt.   In the absence of any contrary evidence, the

rejection of the claim for 25 sovereigns of gold ornaments is

proper and justifiable.

     8. Though the petitioner had claimed  2,00,000/- as

money expended by her parents for conducting the

marriage and an amount of  5,00,000/- towards

compensation for the cruelty shown to her by the

respondent, she miserably failed to adduce any evidence to

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               9

prove the said claim.     Similarly, she failed to prove that

her dress materials and other articles were kept at the

residence of the respondent when she left the matrimonial

home.    In the absence of the evidence, the rejection of

those claims are proper and justifiable. As far as the order

restraining the respondent from committing any kind of

domestic violence, I am of the opinion that the said relief

granted to her is justifiable so long as the marriage exists.

Certainly, the petitioner, being the legally wedded wife of

the respondent, has every right to get a protection order to

live peacefully without interference of the respondent. So,

the protection order is also justifiable.

     9.   There is no illegality or impropriety in the

concurrent findings of the court below. So also, I do not

find any kind of perversity in the appreciation of evidence

also. Re-appreciation of evidence is impermissible unless it

is found that the court below could not have formed the

opinion on the basis of the materials or the findings are so

Crl.R.P.Nos.1081 & 1835 of 2009

                               10

perverse or unacceptable.        The common order under

challenge is confirmed.

     In the result, both revisions are dismissed.

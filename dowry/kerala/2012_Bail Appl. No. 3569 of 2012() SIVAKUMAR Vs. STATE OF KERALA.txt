         =========================
         Dated this the 19th day of June, 2012

                           ORDER


     Petitioners are the accused in Crime no.1428/2011

alleged against them are under Secs.498A, 323, 339, 294

(b), 307, 339, 352 and 506 r/w 34 of IPC. The second and

third petitioners are the father and mother of the first

petitioner. Apprehending arrest, this application is filed

for anticipatory bail.

     2.   In the event of arrest, the petitioners No.2 and

3 (A2 and A3) shall be released on bail on their executing

a bond for Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand only)

each with two solvent sureties each for the like amount to

the satisfaction of the officer obtaining the bond as above.

If not arrested, the petitioners will surrender before the

learned Magistrate having jurisdiction within 10 days

B.A.No.3569/2012
                              : 2 :


from this date and will seek regular bail. The learned

Magistrate will grant bail to those accused (A2 and A3)

on their executing a bond for Rs.20,000/- and on such

other conditions the learned Magistrate may deem fit to

impose.

     3.     As far as the first petitioner is concerned, very

serious allegations are seen made against him. It is stated

that he used to add sedative drugs or sleeping pills in the

drinks given to the complainant. It is also alleged that the

accused had demanded more dowry. The further

allegation is that he trespassed into her house and

brutally assaulted her in front of her relatives and caught

hold of her hair and shouted that he will finish her. It is

also alleged that the first accused had kicked on her

abdomen. There are other allegations also against this

accused.

     4.     Learned counsel for the petitioners submits

that it is nearly impossible to attack the petitioner in the

B.A.No.3569/2012
                            : 3 :


presence of her relatives and that such an allegation is

made only to make the offence more grave. There is also

allegation that the petitioner himself used to make high

intoxicating drugs and consume it by himself.

     5.     Considering all the aspects, application for

anticipatory bail made by A1 is dismissed.

     If the petitioner (A1) surrenders before the Police/

Investigating Officer, after interrogation the petitioner

shall be produced before the Magistrate and if the

petitioner applies for bail the learned Magistrate will

dispose of the same in accordance with law, but after

hearing the learned APP as well and also after perusal of

the case diary, if so required and also after considering

the facts and circumstances of the case.           If the

Investigating Officer files application for police custody

for further interrogation that shall also be considered by

the learned Magistrate in accordance with law.

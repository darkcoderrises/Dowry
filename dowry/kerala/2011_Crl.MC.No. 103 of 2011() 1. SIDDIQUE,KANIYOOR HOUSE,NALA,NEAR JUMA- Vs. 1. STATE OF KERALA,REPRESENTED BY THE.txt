                        Crl. M.C. No.103 of 211
              ====================================
            Dated this the 13th    day of January,    2011


                               O R D E R



      Petitioners are accused in C.C. No.774 of 2010 of the court of

learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod       for offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. De

facto complainant is the wife of petitioner No.1 and according to her,

petitioners subjected her to cruelty, mentally and physically

demanding dowry. Petitioners and de facto complainant have referred

to the incidents that occurred on the various dates. It is stated that at

the time of marriage on 13.07.2000 she was given 60 sovereigns of

gold and Rs.75,000/- but petitioners demanded more and to coerce her

to get that, she was subjected to cruelty, physically and mentally.

While so on 22.07.2010 petitioner Nos.2 to 4 came to her paternal

home (where she was staying then) and subjected her to cruelty,

physically and mentally demanding more dowry. According to the

petitioners allegations are false and from 15.12.2003 onwards de facto

complainant is staying away from petitioner No.1 and since then

petitioners have no contact with       the de facto complainant.    First

petitioner is employed in gulf. Petitioner Nos.2 and 3 are residing at

CRL.M.C.No.103 of 20110
                                 -: 2 :-


Belthangadi. It is contended by learned counsel that allegations are

not correct and no offence is made out.

      2.    I have gone through Annexure-II final report and find that

specific allegations are made against petitioner No.1. So far petitioner

Nos.2 to 4 are concerned there is reference to the alleged incident on

22.07.2010 which also investigation revealed it was in connection with

demand for more dowry.      Though in the complaint, offences under

Secs.324 and 406 of the IPC were also incorporated those Sections

were deleted while submitting final report for offence under Sec.498A

of the Code.      Question whether allegations are true or not is a

matter which the trial court has to decide.       Having regard to the

facts and circumstances of the case I do not find to reason to interfere

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      Resultantly, Criminal Miscellaneous Case is dismissed.




                                   THOMAS P. JOSEPH, JUDGE.

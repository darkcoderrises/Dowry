                    --------------------------------
          Dated this the 20th day of February, 2013

                             O R D E R
                            ~~~~~~~

      Petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.23/2013 of

Chittarickal Police Station for offences under sections 498A and

306 IPC. He was arrested on 18.1.2013. Eversince he is in

judicial custody. The allegation against the petitioner and his

mother, who was arrayed as 2nd accused, is that the petitioner

and the 2nd accused subjected the wife of the petitioner to

cruelty demanding dowry and as a result the wife of the

petitioner committed suicide on 13.1.2013 by setting her ablaze.

When the petitioner was produced before the Judicial

Magistrate of the First     Class-II, Hosdurg he was remanded to

judicial custody. His application for bail was rejected by the

learned Magistrate.     Now this petition seeking an order to

release the petitioner on bail.

      2.    The learned Government Pleader would submit that

there are serious allegations against the petitioner and the 2nd

accused, who is the mother of the petitioner, could not be

arrested as she was laid up.

      3.    Having heard either side and taking into account of

B.A. No.675/2013                    2

the facts and circumstances of the case and that the petitioner

was in custody for about one month, I find that it would be

appropriate to release the petitioner on bail.

      4.     In the result, this petition is allowed. There will be an

order directing the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II,

Hosdurg to release the petitioner on bail on executing a bond

for Rs.20,000/- with two solvent sureties each for like amount to

the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate on the following

conditions.

            1)    Petitioner shall report before the
                  Investigating Officer at 10.a.m. on
                  every Wednesday for a period of
                  three months or until the final
                  report is filed,      whichever event
                  occurs first.

             2)   Petitioner shall not, directly or
                  indirectly, make any inducement,
                  threat or promise to any person
                  acquainted with the facts of the case
                  so   as    to   dissuade     him   from
                  disclosing such facts to the Court or
                  to any police officer.

             3)   Petitioner shall not leave the District
                  without       permission       of   the
                  Magistrate.

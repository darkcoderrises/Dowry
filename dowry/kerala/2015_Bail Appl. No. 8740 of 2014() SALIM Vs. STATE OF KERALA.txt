               ==============================
                    B.A.No.8740 of 2014
               ==============================
             Dated this the 12th day of June, 2015

                           ORDER

           The applicant is the first accused in Crime No.866 of

2014 of the Vattappara Police Station for offence punishable under

Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.   According to the de facto complainant, the marriage

between the de facto complainant and the applicant herein was

solemnized on 20.04.2014 and thereafter, they were living

together as husband and wife. She alleges that the matrimonial

relationship got strained because of the harassment by the

applicant and his parents, in connection with demand for dowry.

A complaint was laid before the jurisdictional magistrate who

forwarded it to the concerned police invoking Section 156(3) of

the Cr.P.C. Applicant seeks bail, apprehending arrest.

      2.   Heard. Examined the records.

      3.   Evidently, the dispute arises from a matrimonial

discord. Though allegations of physical harassment are made, at

present, there is no material to show that she had sustained any

serious physical injury.  Matrimonial proceedings are pending

B.A.8740/14
                                     2


before the Family Court also. Considering these facts, I feel that

custodial interrogation of the accused may not be warranted and

the applicant can be granted bail subject to the following

conditions:

                  (i)   Applicant shall appear before the

            Investigating Officer on 22.06.2015 between

            10 a.m. - 11 a.m. After interrogation,     in the

            event of his arrest, he shall be released on bail

            on the applicant executing a bond for a sum of

            Rs.30,000/- (Rupees thirty thousand only) with

            two sureties for the like sum each.

                  (ii)  Applicant shall co-operate with the

            investigation  and    shall  appear  before  the

            Investigating Officer as and when called for.

                  (iii) Applicant shall not threaten, coerce

            or intimidate the de facto complainant or her

            witnesses.

       This bail application is allowed accordingly.

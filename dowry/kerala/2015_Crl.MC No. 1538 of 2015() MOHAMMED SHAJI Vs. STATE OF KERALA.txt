                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

            This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    Petitioners        are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.979/2014 of Perinthalmanna Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323 and 506

(i) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 final report in

Crime No.979/2014 of Perinthalmanna Police Station as

against the petitioners and all further proceedings based on

it in C.C.607/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Perinthalmanna, quashed.

      4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

Crl.M.C.1538/2015
                               : 2 :



is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto    complainant,   who   is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners   and,   therefore,   all  further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

Crl.M.C.1538/2015
                                : 3 :



quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

FIR and Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.979/2014 of

Perinthalmanna Police Station as against the petitioners and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.607/2014 pending

before the Judicial       First Class     Magistrate's Court-I,

Perinthalmanna are hereby quashed.

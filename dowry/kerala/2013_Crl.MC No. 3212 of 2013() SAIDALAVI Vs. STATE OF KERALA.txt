                 Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                 ------------------------------------
          Dated this the 05th day of August, 2013

                              ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.P.No.26 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Parappanangadi which is a case instituted upon the police

report in Crime No.68 of 2013 of Tanur Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 326 & 308

read with Section 34 of IPC with a prayer to quash Annexure-I

F.I.R. in Crime No.68 of 2013 of Tanur Police Station and all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.P.No.26 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Parappanangadi as the matter is settled out

of court.

     2.   The prosecution allegation is that, at about 4.30 p.m.

on 24/1/2013 at the road in front of a Cement shop namely

Bright Agency, accused 1 to 3 due to their prior animosity,

connected with the property dispute against the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                            :-2-:


complainant and with intention to inflict injuries, the injured

was attacked with sickle and beat him with an iron pipe and

when the first accused attempted to beat CW.1 with iron pipe,

he prevented the same with his right hand and thus the blow

fallen on his right elbow and as a result of which, he sustained

fracture injury and had the blow was not prevented death

would have been resulted and thus the accused has committed

the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 326 &

308 read with Section 34 of IPC. According to the petitioners,

after the incident and while the matter is pending before the

court below, the above dispute is settled between the

petitioners and respondent Nos.2 to 4, who are the de facto

complainant and the injured.     As the affidavit produced as

Annexure-III is improper and as directed by this Court, three

separate affidavits are seen produced by the petitioners by

memo dated 05/08/2013 which is marked as Annexure-

III(1) to (3).

     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as respondents 2 to 4. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                              :-3-:


     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for respondents 2 to 4 who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, who are the de facto

complainant and the injured do not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-III affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                                   :-4-:


     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323, 324, 326 &

308 read with Section 34 of IPC which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for respondents, it appears to me that the injured and

the de facto complainant have no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Crl.M.C.No.3212 of 2013
                             :-6-:


According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I F.I.R. in Crime No.68 of 2013 of Tanur Police

Station and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.P.No.26 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Parappanangadi.

                    -----------------------------------
          Dated this the 10th day of December, 2012

                              O R D E R




     Petitioners are the accused in a pending case on the file of

the     Judicial      First       Class        Magistrate  Court-II,

Thiruvananthapuram. They are being prosecuted for the offence

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. Crime in the above case was registered on a

complaint filed by 2nd respondent, who is the wife of 1st petitioner

alleging matrimonial cruelty and harassment by her husband and

his father, 2nd petitioner, demanding dowry. After completion of

the investigation and indictment made under the report filed,

and, cognizance of offence thereunder taken, it is submitted, the

spouses have resolved their matrimonial disputes and, presently,

they are living together.        The wife/de facto complainant is

no longer interested in prosecuting her husband and her

father-in-law, is the submission of the counsel on both sides.

Crl.M.C.No.3628/2012              2




Learned Public prosecutor, after getting instructions, reports

that resolving the matrimonial disputes, the spouses are living

together under the common roof.          In such circumstances,

continuation of the criminal proceedings against the husband

and his father, that too on a complaint given by the de facto

complainant/wife would result in rupturing the renewed

matrimonial relationship of the spouses. Further more, even if

prosecution is continued, there is remote chance of such

prosecution ending in conviction of any of the accused in view of

the settlement effected by the parties. The Apex Court in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)) has held

that this court can take into account settlement effected by the

parties to exercise its inherent powers to quash the criminal

proceedings even involving non-compoundable offences where

the crime registered has a civil flavour or arise from matrimonial

disputes of parties.       Taking into consideration the view

expressed by the Apex Court as above and the facts ad

circumstances presented, I find, criminal proceedings against

the petitioners are liable to be terminated.

Crl.M.C.No.3628/2012             3




      Criminal      proceedings against petitioners/accused  in

C.C.No.194 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed invoking

the inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.



      Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

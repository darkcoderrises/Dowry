                  K.RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                  ---------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014
                -------------------------------
          Dated this the 29th day of May, 2014

                           ORDER


        This is an application filed by the petitioner who is

the sole accused in L.P.No.7/2009 (Crime No.197/2007 of

Kollam East Police Station) of Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court Kollam on the basis of settlement under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred as

the 'Code').

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is

the sole accused in Crime No.197/2009 of Kollam East

Police Station which was registered on the basis of

statement given by the 2nd respondent as de facto

complainant who is none other than the father of the

petitioner alleging offences under Sections 294(b) and 326

of the Indian Penal code (for short the 'IPC').         After

investigation, final report was filed in the case and since

the petitioner did not appear, after complying with the

procedure,    the learned Magistrate has      transferred the

case to register of long pending cases and it is pending as

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014                     2

L.P.No.7/2009 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's

Court, Kollam.            In the mean time the matter has been

settled between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and

now they are living together. In view of the settlement

there is no possibility of conviction in this case. Since

some of the offence are non-compoundable nature, no

application can be forwarded before the court below to

compound the case.                   So the petitioner has no remedy

except to approach this Court seeking the following relief.

                 " to quash Annexure-B Final report /chargesheet in

        Crime No.197/2007 of Kollam -East Police Station as it is an

        abuse of process of court and all subsequent proceedings

        pursuant to L.P.No.7/2009 on the file of         the Chief Judicial

        Magistrate Court, Kollam and pass such other order, as is deemed

        fit, to secure the ends of justice in this case."



      3. Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he has no grievance against the petitioner who

is his son and he does not want to prosecute his son and

they are now living together.                       He had filed an affidavit

stating these facts.

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014       3

      4. Counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction

and settlement has been arrived due to the intervention of

the mediators. On account of the settlement the family

relationship has been restored and now they are living

together.

        5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,     as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner but opposed the application on the

ground that offence under Section 326 IPC is committed.

        6.   It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and

second respondent are son and father.         It is also an

admitted fact that on the basis of the statement given by

the second respondent as de facto complainant,         Crime

No.197/2007 of Kollam Police Station was registered

against the petitioner alleging offences under Sections

294(b) and 326 of the IPC. It is also an admitted fact that

after investigation final report was filed before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kollam and since the petitioner

did not appear,       the case was transferred to register of

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014         4

long pending cases and it was pending before that Court as

L.P.No.7/2009. Now the matter has been settled between

the parties. It is also seen from Annexure B affidavit filed

by the second respondent that the matter has been settled

and difference of opinion between the father and son has

been resolved due to the intervention of mediators and the

family members and now they are living together and he

does not want to prosecute his son in view of the

subsequent development and change of attitude on the

part of his son.      It is true that the offence under Section

326 of the IPC has been incorporated which is a grave

offence. Considering the fact that matter has been settled

and it it is a dispute between father and son and in view

of the settlement no purpose will be served by proceeding

the case as they will not support the case of prosecution

and conviction in such cases is remote,         this Court feels

that it is the case where power under Section 482 of the

Code has to be invoked.

        7. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [(2012 (4) KLT 108 SC)] the Hon'ble

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014            5

Supreme Court held as follows:


             "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a
      criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
      with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
      accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;
      (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse
      of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R
      may be exercised where the offender and victim have
      settled their dispute would depend on the facts and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though
      the victim or victim's family and the offender have
      settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in
      nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly,
      any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like
      Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed
      by public servants while working in that capacity etc;
      cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
      proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
      cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
      of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
      disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute.   In this category of case, High Court
      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim,
      the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014            6

      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
      case   despite    full and   complete    settlement   and
      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High
      Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
      of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
      end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



         8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a family

dispute between father and son which culminated in the

criminal case and the matter has been settled between the

parties due to the intervention of mediators and the family

relationship has been restored, this Court feels that the

power under Section 482 of the Code has to be invoked

to quash the proceedings in order to promote the

settlement which resulted in harmony in the family and

pendency of this case should not be hurdle for the same.

      So the application is allowed and further proceedings

in    L.P.No.7/2009 (Crime No.197/2007 of Kollam East

Police Station) pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Crl.M.C.No.2737 of 2014     7

Court, Kollam as against the petitioner is quashed. Office

is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court for necessary further action in this regard.

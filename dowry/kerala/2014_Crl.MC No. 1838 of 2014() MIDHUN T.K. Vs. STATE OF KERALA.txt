            ------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 1st day of April, 2014


                                     O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is field by the

sole accused in C.C.No.705/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First  Class     Magistrate              Court,         Payyannur,            in Crime

No.282/2013, to quash the proceedings, in view of the

settlement arrived at between the petitioner and the

defacto-complainant under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the `Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.705/2013 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur.

It was originated on the basis of a statement given by the

2nd respondent, who is none other than the father of the

petitioner and Crime No.282/2013 of Payyannur Police

Station was registered alleging offences under Section 452,

506(1), 323 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and

Annexure-A1 First Information Report was registered. After

Crl. M.C. No.1838 of 2014
                                  2

investigation, Annexure-A2 final report was field and the

case was taken on file as C.C.No.705/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. The 2nd

respondent, who is none other than the father of the

petitioner, does not want to proceed against him. No

purpose will be served by proceeding the case as well, in

view of the settlement. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature, the petitioner has no other

remedy, except to approach this court, seeking the

following relief:

            "It is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble
      Court may be pleased to quash all further proceedings in
      Annexure-2 charge and the consequent CC.No.705/2013
      pending on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate,
      Payyannur."

            3.    2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled and he has

no intention to proceed against the petitioner, who is his

son and now they are residing together and he has no

grievance against his son and he field Annexure-3 affidavit

stating all these facts.

Crl. M.C. No.1838 of 2014
                                 3

            4.    The counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that, in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

proceeding the case.

            5.    Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner and he has no criminal background

and it is a dispute between the father and son, but opposed

the application.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, who is none other

than the father of the petitioner, Annexure-1 first

information report was registered as crime No.282/2013 of

Payyannur Police Station, alleging offences under Section

452, 506(1), 323, 427 of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation Annexure-A2 final report was filed and it was

taken on file as C.C.No.705/2013 and that is pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Payyannur. It is also

mentioned in the petition that, being son and father, the

matter has been settled due to the intervention of mediators

Crl. M.C. No.1838 of 2014
                                       4

and family members and they are now living together and

the father has no grievance against the son.

            7.    The 2nd respondent also appeared though

counsel and supported the settlement and filed Annexure-3

affidavit stating these facts as well. It is also seen from the

affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent that, the petitioner is

now residing with them and he is looking after them and he

has no grievance against his son and the relationship has

been restored on account of the settlement and he had

understood the mistake as well.

            8.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

Crl. M.C. No.1838 of 2014
                                       5

      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             9.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, it is a dispute

between the son and father, which has been settled, due to

the intervention of mediators and family members and the

relationship has been restored and they are living together

harmoniously, after the settlement and there is no

Crl. M.C. No.1838 of 2014
                                  6

possibility of any conviction being entered against the

petitioner, in view of the settlement, as the defacto-

complainant or his witnesses will not support the case of the

prosecution and the possibility of conviction will be remote,

this court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings, especially to promote the

settlement, which resulted in the harmony between the

father and son and the pendency of this case should not be

a hurdle for such relationship. So the petition is allowed

and    further     proceedings    in  C.C.No.705/2013        (Crime

No.282/2013 of Payyannur Police Station), pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyanuur,

against the petitioner is quashed.          Office is directed to

communicate          this order    to    the  concerned       court,

immediately.

                ----------------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                ---------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 7th April, 2014

                             O R D E R



     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused    in C.C. 4147/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Alathur to quash the proceedings

on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused in C.C.Nos. 4147/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur which was originated

on the basis of the       statement given by 3rd             respondent

against the petitioners alleging offences under Sections

143, 147, 148, 323 and 427 read with Section 149 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3. It is alleged in the petition that apart from defacto

complainant, 4th respondent also sustained some injuries

Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                 2

and later the matter has been settled between the parties.

Incident occurred due to some provocation          caused on

account of an       accident occurred involving a tipper lorry

driven by 3rd respondent. The matter has been now settled

between the parties. Respondents 3 and 4 do not want to

prosecute the case.          No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well in view of the settlement.

Since some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature,

they cannot file an application before the concerned Court.

So they have no other remedy except to approach this

Court seeking the following reliefs:

              " To pass an order to quash annexure - II

              Final Report and all further proceedings

              against the petitiners in C.C.No.4147/2013

              on the      file of the Judicial First Class

              Magistrate Court, Alathur".

     4. Respondents 3 and 4 appeared through counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled between

the parties and they do not want to prosecute the case in

 Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                3

view of the settlement. They      have also stated that they

have filed Crl.M.A. 2910/2014 to record compounding.

      5. The counsel for petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement,      no purpose will be served    by

proceeding with the case. So they prayed for allowing the

application.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court      submitted that 5th petitioner is

involved in Crime No. 947/2013 under Sections 143, 147,

188 and 283 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code

of Mangal Dam Police Station and opposed the application.

      7. Counsel for the petitioners submitted that,    that

was a case registered       in connection with some political

procession that has been taken out in protest against

some      governing policy which according to the political

party is against public interest.

      8. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the        3rd respondent,  a   crime was

 Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                4

registered as Crime No. 756/2013 of Mangal Dam Police

Station against the petitioners alleging     offences under

Sections 147, 148 and 323 read with Section 149 of the

Indian Penal Code against the petitioners and          after

investigation final report was filed and it was taken on file

as C.C.4147/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Alathur and it is pending before that

Court.     Now the matter      has been settled between the

parties. They have filed Crl.M.A.2190/2014 for recording

compounding. Since offences under Sections 143, 147,

148 are non-compoundable in nature and compounding as

such cannot be recorded         but that  can be taken into

consideration for considering the question as to whether the

case against the petitioners can be quashed or not. In the

compounding petition, they have stated that the matter

has been settled between the parties and they do not want

to prosecute the petitioners. Further it is seen from the

final report that the       incident occurred on account of

 Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                     5

sudden provocation caused in the mob when the tipper

lorry hit against a lady who died in the incident. It is true

that people are not expected to take law into their hands

but sometimes emotions make them to do such things.

That has been now considered by the respondents and they

have decided to forgive them as well.              No purpose will be

served on account of the settlement because none of the

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution. Further

the nature of injury sustained and loss caused also are not

grave. Merely because 5th petitioner had involved in some

crime which was registered in respect of conducting some

procession along with political party workers                    is not a

ground to         come to a conclusion that he is a habitual

offender and this case cannot be quashed on account of

that fact.

      9.      Further in the decision reported       in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
     be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
     criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its

Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                      6

    inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
    given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
    S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
    statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
    guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
    justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
    what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
    or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
    settled   their   dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
    circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
    However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
    have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
    Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
    like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
    even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
    settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
    have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
    offences committed by public servants while working in that
    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
    proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
    having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
    on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
    the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
    partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
    of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
    where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
    the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
    of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
    view, because of the compromise between the offender and
    victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
    continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
    oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
    caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
    complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
    words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
    or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
    and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
    whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
    criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
    question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within

 Crl.M.C. No. 1887 of 2014
                                       7

     its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of mediators and

good relationship has been restored            between the parties and

possibility of conviction is remote in view of the settlement, this

Court feels that no purpose will be served in proceeding with

the case as it will amount to wastage of judicial time alone and it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the Code

can be invoked to quash the proceeding.

      10. So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No. 4147/2013 (Crime No. 756/2013 of                  Mangalam Dam

Police Station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Alathur as against the petitioners is quashed.

       Office is      directed to communicate          this  order to the

concerned court for further action immediately.

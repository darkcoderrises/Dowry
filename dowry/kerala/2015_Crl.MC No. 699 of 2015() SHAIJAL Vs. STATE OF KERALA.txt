                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 699 of 2015
             =======================
             Dated this the 3rd day of March, 2015

                           O R D E R



      Petitioner is accused in Crime No.735 of 2014 of the

Thamarassery Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C.for getting Annexure-A FIR in Crime No.735 of 2014

of the Thamarassery Police Station and all proceedings against

the petitioner in the said crime, pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-1, Thamarassery, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C. No. 699 of 2015
                                 2

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.     Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

Crl.M.C. No. 699 of 2015
                                  3

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioner, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A FIR

in Crime No.735 of 2014 of the Thamarassery Police Station and

all proceedings against the petitioner in the said crime, pending

before    the     Judicial  First   Class   Magistrate's  Court-1,

Thamarassery , are hereby quashed.



                                                 Sd/-
                                     B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

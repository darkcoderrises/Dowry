                Crl.M.C.No.4218 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of July, 2014.


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.74

of 2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Hosdurg, which is a case instituted upon the police report

[in Crime No.114 of 2012 of Bekal Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Section 363 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash AII final report in the above crime, as the

matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

4.3.2012 at 8 p.m., the accused, who is the neighbour of

the 2nd respondent/de facto complainant, kidnapped the

daughter of the de facto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein and the victim, from the quarters and

Crl.M.C.No.4218 of 2014
                               2

went to Tamilnadu and thereby committed the offence as

alleged by the prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioner

is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st and 2nd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case.      Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5.      The learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the victim and the de facto

complainant respectively, do not intends to proceed any

further against the petitioner and they have no grievance

Crl.M.C.No.4218 of 2014
                                3

against him.

         6.        I  have carefully considered   the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 363 of

I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved.     It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.       From the submission made by the

counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents, it appears to me

Crl.M.C.No.4218 of 2014
                                    4

that the victim and the de facto complainant have no

further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)].      In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,

Crl.M.C.No.4218 of 2014
                                   5

         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

                                6

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing AII

final report in Crime No.114 of 2012 of Bekal Police Station

and all further proceedings pending against the petitioner

in C.C.No.74 of 2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Hosdurg.

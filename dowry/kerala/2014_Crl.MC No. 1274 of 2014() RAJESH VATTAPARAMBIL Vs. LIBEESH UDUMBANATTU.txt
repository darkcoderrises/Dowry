     ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014
     ==============================
       Dated this, the 28th day of February, 2014.


                          O R D E R


      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 3 in

Crime No.799/13 of Sreekandapuram Police Station to quash

further proceedings against them in view of the settlement

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.799/13 of Sreekandapuram

Police Station which was registered on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant injured who is the

first respondent herein against the petitioners alleging offences

under Sections.341, 323, 324, 308 read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code. The investigation is in progress. In the

meantime, the petitioners and the de facto complainant were

relatives and due to the intervention of mediators and well

wishers, the matter has been settled between them and first

respondent does not want to proceed with the prosecution

against the petitioners. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature, petitioners have no other option

except to approach this court seeking the following relief:

Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014      :  2 :


                  "To  quash Annexure   A1  F.I.R.  in  Crime

     No.799/2013 of Sreekandapuram Police Station Kannur

     District."

      3.      First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that since the petitioners and first respondent were

relatives and due to the interventions of mediators and well

wishers and family members, the matter has been settled and

first respondent also filed an affidavit to that effect and he has

no objection in quashing the proceedings.

      4.      The Counsel for the petitioners have also submitted

that now they are living in harmony.

      5.      The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions

submitted that except this case, there is no other case against

the petitioners and they have no criminal background as well.

But, however, opposed the application for quashing at this

stage as it is in the crime stage.

      6.      It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the first respondent, the Sreekandapuram

police has registered a case as Crime No.799/13 against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections.341, 323, 324,

308 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.                The

investigation is in the primitive stage. Due to the intervention

Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014      :  3 :

of family members and relatives, the matter has been settled

between the de facto complainant and the petitioners herein.

The first respondent who is the de facto complainant now filed

an affidavit before this court stating that the matter has been

settled between the parties as they are close relatives and

neighbours and harmony has been restored between them.

So, he does not want to proceed with the prosecution.

      7.     Normally, this court will not interfere in the

investigation and quash the proceedings at the initial stage

namely at the crime stage especially when offence under

Section 308 of Indian Penal Code is involved. But, in this case,

the parties are relatives and neighbours and due to the

intervention of mediators and well wishers and family

members, the matter has been settled and the cordial

relationship between them has been restored.        Further, on

going through the wound certificate of the injured, it is seen

that the injuries sustained were not of grave nature though

dangerous weapon like hammer is alleged to have been used.

The allegation against other two accused persons are not that

way as well.

      8.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014           :  4 :

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] is held as follows:

               "The  position   that   emerges     from  the  above
       discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
       Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or
       complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
       and different from the power given to a criminal court for
       compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
       limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
       guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends
       of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
       Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
       proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where
       the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
       depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
       category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of
       such power, the High Court must have due regard to the
       nature and gravity of the crime.         Heinous and serious
       offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
       dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
       victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
       dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
       serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
       between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
       under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or
       the offences committed by public servants while working in
       that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
       criminal proceedings involving such offences.        But the
       criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
       civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
       quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
       financial, mercantile, civil,      partnership or such like
       transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
       relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
       wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
       parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
       of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
       view, because of the compromise between the offender and
       victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
       continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
       oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
       caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
       and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
       In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
       would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
       continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
       criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process
       of law despite settlement and compromise between the

Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014           :   5 :

       victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
       justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and
       if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the
       High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the
       criminal proceeding."

      9.      In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the petitioners and

the first respondent are relatives and neighbours and due to

the intervention of well wishers, mediators, family members

and friends, the cordial relationship between them has been

restored and the de facto complainant does not want to

proceed with the prosecution against the petitioners, this court

feels that no purpose will be served in allowing even

investigation to proceed as the de facto complainant or other

witnesses are not going to support the investigating officer in

this regard. So, it will only a wastage of time of the court as

well as the investigation agency is concerned to allow the

investigation to continue. Considering the fact that the family

relationship has been restored on account of the intervention

of family members and friends, the pendency of this crime

should not be a hurdle for their harmony to continue.                  So,

treating this as exceptional case, this court feels that it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings as no

Crl.M.C.No.1274 of 2014     :  6 :

effective purpose will be served in allowing the investigation to

continue in the matter.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.799/13 of Sreekandapuram Police Station against

the petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate

this order to the concerned court so as to inform the

investigating agency about this for their further action in this

regard.

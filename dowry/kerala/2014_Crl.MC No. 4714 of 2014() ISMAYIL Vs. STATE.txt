                      -------------------------------
                     Crl. M.C No.4714 of 2014
                      -------------------------------
              Dated this the 20th day of August, 2014.


                              O R D E R

            The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is accused in C.P.No.44/2014 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Parappanangadi, which is a case instituted

upon the police report in Crime No. 969/2013 of Tanur Police Station

for the offences punishable under Section 376 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure D final report in Crime No.969/2013 of Tanur

Police Station and proceedings pursuant to the same, now pending as

C.P No.44/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Parappanangadi as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that the de facto

complainant and the petitioner were in love for the last three years.

Almost two years back on a day, they indulged in sexual acts on the

Crl.M.C.No.4714/ 2014
                                    2



promise of marriage offered by the petitioner. De facto complainant

consented to the sexual act believing on the promise of the petitioner

as also on the fear of disgrace. The sexual acts continued for long

time and gradually when it was made known to the public, petitioner

fled from the place. Later, the de facto complainant became pregnant

and petitioner insisted her to abort it. However, she did not agree

and the petitioner declined to marry her and thus, the petitioner has

committed the aforesaid offence and now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above crime.         Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.4714/ 2014
                                      3



          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the basis

of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the

above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case is only

under Section 376 of IPC, which is more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the petitioner/accused

Crl.M.C.No.4714/ 2014
                                            4



in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57.   The position that emerges from the above
           discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
           Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
           in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
           from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
           the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
           wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
           exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
           power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
           abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
           case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
           from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
           such like transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
           where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
           and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
           is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
           put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
           injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite      full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

                                     5




         8.   Sri. T. Asaf Ali, learned Director General of Prosecutions,

on the strength of the decision in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] submitted that the rape cases are specifically excluded

being allowed to compound or being quash any exercise of the powers of

the Hon'ble High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. learned Director General of Prosecutions has pointed out that

there are occasions where after filing an affidavit by the victim in this

court, in support of the wrongdoer, to quash the proceedings pending

against the petitioner/accused, harassing the victim or withdraw from the

promise to marry her. I am also sharing the view of the learned Director

General of Prosecutions. In Gian Singh's case, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has specifically stated that :

                 "Heinous and serious offences of mental
               depravity or offences like murder, rape,
               dacoity etc cannot be finttingly quashed
               even though the victim or victim's family
               and the offender have settled the dispute".

         According to me, the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case is entirely different and in the present case the accused and

the victim married each other and as disclosed from Annexure E affidavit

Crl.M.C.No.4714/ 2014
                                     6



filed by the victim, it can be seen that the marriage was solomnized on

21.02.2014 at Masjid Salam Dharusalam Madrassa and the said fact is

further supported by Annexure C Marriage Certificate issued from the

same Madrassa Mahallu Committee, Unniyal. Therefore, according to

me, it is the duty of this Court in exercise of the jurisdiction vested with

under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to give effect of the compromise arrived

between the victim and the accused and to permit them to have their

marital life run in a smooth manner. Overlooking the said fact, this Court

is not stepping into help the victim and the accused and if the criminal

proceedings are allowed to proceed against the petitioner it is likely to

affect their matrimonial life and create unnecessary inconvenience and

atmosphere in the matrimonial home. As per the present stand of the

victim, according to me, if the trial is proceeded overlooking the above

approach and stand of the victim, there would not be any fruitful

prosecution rather the net result would be sheer wastage of judicial time.

So, according to me, it is a fit case where this court has to allow the

prayer quashing the proceedings pending against the petitioner and

thereby create a peaceful atmosphere so as to enable the petitioner as well

as the victim to have an affectionate and peaceful marital life.

                                   7




         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -D

and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.P.No.44/2014      of    the    Judicial    First  Class   Magistrate

Court,Parappanangadi in Crime No. 969/2013 of Tanur Police Station.

               Crl.M.C.No. 4374 of 2005
           ---------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 30th day of May, 2008

                          O R D E R


           This Crl.M.C. is directed against the order

dated 27.2.2004 in M.C.No.40 of 2002 and against the

order dated 30.9.2005 in Crl.R.P.No.10 of 2004.            The

petitioner herein is the revision petitioner before the

Sessions Court and the respondent in the trial court.

M.C.No.40 of 2002 is a petition filed by one Saheera who

is the wife of the petitioner herein claiming a sum of

Rs.15,000/- for maintenance for three months iddath

period at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month, Rs.5,00,000/-

for reasonable and fair provision, 5 sovereign gold

ornaments as mahr, 67 sovereign gold ornaments and

Rs1,75,000/- which was paid to the respondent and to

return the wrist watch.

      2.   The respondent herein preferred the above

claim petition (M.C.No.40 of 2002) under Sections 3(1)(a),

(c) and (d) and under Section 3(2) of the Muslim Women

(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. According to

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                            :-2-:

the averments in the claim petition, the petitioner

married the claimant on 16.4.2000 and they lived

together for eight months. According to the claimant, on

8.8.2002, the petitioner herein divorced her by

pronouncing talaq. It is the further case of the claimant

that at the time of marriage, she was given 67 sovereign

gold ornaments out of which 60 sovereign gold

ornaments were taken and misappropriated by the

respondent within one month of their marriage. It is

also averred that an amount of Rs.50,000/- was given to

the respondent for marriage expenses. The mahr fixed

for the marriage was 5 sovereigns and a wrist watch was

also given to the petitioner herein. It is also alleged that

an amount of Rs.1,25,000/- was received by the

petitioner herein from the family members of the

claimant for the business purposes and that amount was

also not returned.     It is averred that thereafter, the

petitioner herein who is the husband of the claimant

harassed her mentally and physically demanding more

gold ornaments and dowry. According to the wife- the

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                           :-3-:

claimant, after eight months of their marriage, she was

abandoned by her husband, the petitioner herein and

thereafter, nothing was given towards maintenance. It

is also averred that the husband has got landed property

business and therefore, she filed the above petition

claiming those amounts under various heads.

      3.     Denying the averments and claims, the

petitioner herein who is the respondent in the M.C. filed

a counter in which it is stated that at the time of

marriage, he had received less than 25 sovereign gold

ornaments and the same and her cloths were taken away

by the claimant in pursuance of mediation talk which

took place in the presence of Mahal Committee Office

bearers.     According to the petitioner- husband, the

mahr of 5 sovereign gold chain was given to the

claimant at the time of marriage itself.       All other

transactions were denied. According to the petitioner

herein/husband, the claimant and her brothers came to

the shop where he was working and demanded divorce

and thereby, he was forced to pronounce the talaq. It is

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                            :-4-:

also the case of the petitioner herein-husband that he

has not pronounced the talaq for three times as insisted

by the law, but only once. Therefore, according to the

petitioner/husband,     the    claim   petition   is   not

maintainable. It is also averred that the petitioner has

no job and he has no landed property as such and he has

no capacity to re-pay the amount as claimed by the

claimant/wife.

      4.   Considering    the    averments,   claims   and

counter claims and statements and pleadings, the trial

court formulated six issues.       During the trial, two

witnesses were examined from the side of the petitioner

therein-wife as Pws.1 and 2 and the exhibits were

marked as Exts.P1 to P3.          From the side of the

respondent     therein-husband,    CPWs.1    to   6   were

examined and Ext.D1 was marked as documentary

evidence. While concluding the trial, the trial court had

allowed the petition and the petitioner herein was directed

to pay Rs.3,000/- as maintenance for the three months iddat

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                             :-5-:

period, Rs.1,00,000/- as reasonable and fair provision and

Rs.2,68,800/- as being the value of 60 sovereign gold

ornaments taken by the respondent. Thus, the husband of

the petitioner therein had to pay a total sum of Rs.3,71,800/-

to the petitioner under Section 3(i)(a) and (d) and 3(2) of the

Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.

      5. Aggrieved by the above order of the trial court,

the petitioner herein preferred a criminal revision

petition Crl.R.P.No.10 of 2004 before the Court of the

Additional Sessions Judge(ADHOC) II, Kalpetta and by

its judgment dated 30.9.2005, the Sessions Court

allowed the revision partly, modifying the only order of the

trial court with regard to the value of the gold ornaments

from 2,68,800/- to 1,92,640/- and in all other respects,

the order of the trial court was not interfered with.        It

is the above orders of the trial court as well as the

revisional court are challenged by the husband in this

petition filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                            :-6-:

      6.   I have perused the records and materials

available on record and heard learned counsel for the

petitioner as well as learned counsel for the respondent.

Counsel for the petitioner very much argued that the

findings of the trial court as well as the revisional court

and fixation of the maintenance are unsustainable and

the same was done without any material or evidence.

With this respect, it is relevant to note that in the

petition, the wife though claimed a total sum of

Rs.5,00,000/- for reasonable and fair provision, the trial

court had granted Rs.1,00,000/-. It is also relevant to

note that though the wife claimed Rs.15,000/- for

maintenance for three months period at the rate of

Rs.5,000/-, the trial court fixed the same as only

Rs.3,000/- at the rate of Rs.1,000/- per month.        The

specific case of the petitioner that there is no evidence

to establish the income and the court below fixed the

amount without any basis. It is the admitted case of the

petitioner that he is a salesman and if that be so, it

cannot be said that the amount fixed by the court below

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                            :-7-:

as reasonable and fair provision is exorbitant or

improper. So also, the maintenance of the Iddat period

also cannot be said as exorbitant.

      7.    The main argument advanced on behalf of the

petitioner herein is that the amount fixed by the courts

below towards gold ornaments is absolutely incorrect as

the same is not supported by any evidence or materials.

On a perusal of the order of the trial court, it can be

seen that at the time of marriage, 67 sovereigns of gold

ornaments were given to the petitioner/claimant and the

documentary       evidence   namely     Ext.P1    marriage

certificate, which contained the signature of the

petitioner herein/respondent therein, would show that

she was given 67 sovereign gold ornaments. Since the

documentary evidence supported the claim of the wife

which contained the signature of the husband - the

petitioner herein, the petitioner cannot deny the same.

It is the further case of the petitioner herein/respondent

that since the marital relationship between the

petitioner and the wife worsened, mediators have

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                           :-8-:

intervened and there was mediation talk and through

such settlement, the entire gold ornaments were given

back to the respondent herein. According to him, going

by the evidence, especially the evidence of CPW3 and

CPW6, it can be seen that the entire gold ornaments

were given back.       But, on a close scrutiny of the

evidence of CPW3, what revealed is that gold ornaments

below 25 sovereigns were given back to the wife

whereas the evidence of CPW6 shows that 22 sovereigns

of   gold   ornaments     were   given   back  to    the

wife/respondent on the basis of the settlement. But, the

trial court came into a conclusion that 60 sovereigns

gold ornaments were taken by the petitioner herein and

hence he had to pay a sum of Rs.2,68,800/- being the

value of 60 sovereigns.       So the trial court, while

disposing of the M.C., directed the respondent to pay a

sum of Rs.3,71,800/- out of which Rs.1,00,000/- is fixed

as reasonable and fair provision and Rs.3,000/- is fixed

as maintenance for that period. The petitioner herein

challenged the above order before the Sessions Court by

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                            :-9-:

filing the revision petition. Suffice to say, the order of

the trial court was not challenged by the wife on any

account. While disposing of the revision petition, the

revisional court had found on the basis of the evidence

adduced at the time of trial that 24 sovereigns of gold

ornaments were given back to the wife and therefore,

the petitioner/husband is liable to pay back the value of

43 sovereigns only. The above finding of the revisional

court is not fully correct.

      8.   According to the claimant/wife, the total gold

ornaments given to her at the time of her marriage was

67 sovereigns and as per the averments and the

allegations contained in the petition before the trial

court, the petitioner herein/the husband had mis-

appropriated 60 sovereigns out of 67 sovereigns given to

her at the time of marriage and she has no allegation of

misappropriation       with respect   to  7    sovereigns.

Therefore, the revisional court ought to have reduced

the 24 sovereigns which were given back to the wife

from a total of 60 sovereigns which is alleged to have

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                           :-10-:

mis-appropriated by the petitioner/husband.        So the

balance gold ornaments liable to pay back by the

petitioner/husband will come only 36 sovereigns and not

43 sovereigns. The value of one sovereign at the time of

the relevant period was fixed as Rs.4,480/-. Therefore,

the total amount will come to Rs.1,61,280/-.          It is

pertinent to note that the respondent herein- the wife

had not chosen to file any petition before this Court

against the order of the revisional court by which the

revisional court found and fixed the gold ornaments

liable to be returned by the petitioner herein as 43

sovereigns. Therefore, this Court will have to interfere

with the finding of the revisional court with respect to

the quantification of the gold ornaments, which are

liable to be returned by the petitioner to the wife. In the

light of the definite allegation that the petitioner had

misappropriated only 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments

and in the light of the fact that there is no allegation or

misappropriation of seven sovereigns, the actual gold

ornaments to be fixed is 36 sovereigns or its equivalent

Crl.M.C.NO.4374 of 2005

                          :-11-:

value to be paid back by the petitioner herein.

      9.   Accordingly, the order of the court below is

modified and the petitioner is directed to pay a sum of

Rs.1,61,280/- to the respondent herein/wife being the

value of 36 sovereigns. This Crl.M.C. is partly allowed,

modifying the order of the court below with regard to

the value of the gold ornaments to be paid by the

petitioner herein.

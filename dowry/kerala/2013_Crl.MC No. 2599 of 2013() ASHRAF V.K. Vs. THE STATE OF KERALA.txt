                      Crl.M.C.No. 2599 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the 8th accused in Crime No.143 of 1998 of Kannur

City Police. The court took cognizance of the crime and numbered as

C.C.No.126 of 1999.        The petitioner is charged under Sections

143,147,148,452,323,324,506(II) read with Section 149 of the I.P.C

Accused Nos.1 to 7 were acquitted in C.C.No.126 of 1999 on

23.8.2001.    The case against the petitioner was split up as

C.C.No.502/2001 and later numbered as LPC 43/2002. This Crl.M.C.

is preferred with a prayer to quash Annexure A-1 final report as

Cr.No.143/1998 of Kannur City Police dated 30.11.1998 and all

further proceedings in LPC 43/2002 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate-II,Kannur, as the matter is settled out of court.

Crl.M.C.No.2599 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that at about 12.30

p.m. on 30.11.1998, the accused trespassed into the house of the de

facto complainant and assaulted with stick and thereby, caused

injuries to them. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

third   respondent/the    de   facto   complainant   and    the  fourth

respondent/injured. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the third respondent/the de facto

complainant and the fourth respondent/injured, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent submitted that the

Crl.M.C.No.2599 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

above respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the injured

do not intend to proceed any further against the petitioner and they

have no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. Annexure A2 is the joint affidavit filed by

respondents 3 and 4 and I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 143,147,148,452,323,324,506(II) read with Section 149

of the I.P.C which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences

are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

Crl.M.C.No.2599 of 2013

                                         :-4-:

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the third and fourth respondents, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant and the injured have no further grievance against

the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

         exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

         would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

Crl.M.C.No.2599 of 2013

                                             :-5-:

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in

the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in

the present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

Crl.M.C.No.2599 of 2013

                                  :-6-:

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -

A1 final report in Cri me No.143/1998 of Kannur City Police dated

30.11.998 and all further proceedings in LPC 43 of 2002 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Kannur.

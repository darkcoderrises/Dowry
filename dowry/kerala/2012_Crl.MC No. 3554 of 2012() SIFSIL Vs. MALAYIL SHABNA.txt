             ---------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 3554 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 19th day of December, 2012

                            ORDER

      The question arising for consideration is whether a

complainant at the stage of enquiry under Section 202 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure for short the 'Code' can ask the Court

to issue summons to his witnesses to secure their presence.

Petitioner/complainant in the present case moved an application

stating that witnesses Nos. 2 and 3 included in the list of

witnesses filed with the complaint will not appear before the

court unless summons is ordered to them. That application was

filed under Section 311 of the Code. Learned magistrate turned

down that application vide Annexure IV order expressing the view

that at the stage of taking cognizance under Section 200 of the

Code, complainant has to produce the witnesses. That order is

challenged in the above petition invoking the inherent powers of

this Court under Section 482 of the Code.

      2.   Presumably, the learned magistrate has not taken

note of the scope of Section 200 of the Code. Taking cognizance

of the offence on a complaint       is simultaneously done with

Crl.M.C.No. 3554 of 2012        2




recording of the sworn statement of the complainant whether or

not complainant has produced any witness at the time of his

examination before the Court. After recording the sworn

statement of complainant if any further step before issuing

process to the accused named is taken by magistrate it is a case

of deferring the issue of process and proceeding with an enquiry

under Section 202 of the Code to determine whether the process

has to be issued, giving an opportunity to the complainant to lead

further evidence in support of his complainant.     So much so,

learned magistrate was not justified in observing in Annexure IV

order that taking of cognizance is deferred after recording the

sworn statement of the complainant. Leaving that aspect the

question to be considered is whether summons could be ordered

to the witnesses of the complainant at the stage of enquiry under

Section 202 of the Code. That question is no longer res integra

as this Court in Thilakan V. Sukumaran, (1981 KHC 102) has

held that even at the stage of enquiry, complainant can request

for issue of summons to a witness when he is unable to secure

his presence before Court. The fact that petition has been filed

quoting a wrong provision, as in the present case, under Section

Crl.M.C.No. 3554 of 2012          3




311, is also no ground to turn down that request. All the same

after looking into the complaint and the allegations raised

thereunder, it is seen the complainant in the present case has

applied for issue a summons to two advocates who appeared for

rival parties, one of them the complainant and the other, his wife,

that too in proceedings touching upon their matrimonial disputes.

Those advocates were involved in compromise talks and some

settlement was arrived at, and to give effect such settlement he

parted some money to both the advocates is his case. But, later,

the wife withdrew from the agreement, is the basis for

proceeding against her in his complaint imputing offence under

Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Admittedly, petitioner and

his parents are being prosecuted on a report filed, after

investigation by the police, in a crime registered at the insistence

of wife imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment demanding

dowry. When that proceeding was challenged before this court to

quash the same, there was a mediation talk and what transferred

thereof is his case to file a complaint before the magistrate

imputing cheating by the wife. To prosecute that complaint he

has sought for issuing summons to counsel who appeared for the

Crl.M.C.No. 3554 of 2012          4




parties before the magistrate court.       At this stage, on the

allegations set out in the complaint, propriety demands that

advocates who appeared for rival parties are not to be

summoned by the court to substantiate the case of the

complainant. So much so, the order of court declining summons

to the witnesses cited, though for different reason, does not

warrant interference. However, I make it clear that one

opportunity shall be given to complainant to produce any other

witness in case he seeks so, in the enquiry proceeded under

Section 202 of the Code.

       Subject to the above observations, the petition is dismissed.

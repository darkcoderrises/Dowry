                       ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                    ==================
                      Crl.M.C.No. 5756 of 2014
                    ==================
             Dated this the 24th day of October, 2014
                              O R D E R

       The two petitioners herein are accused Nos.1 and 2 in

Annexure-1 Crime No. 537/2012 of Mannancherry Police Station for

offence alleged under Sec. 420 read with Sec.34 of the IPC. The

crime was registered on 7.6.2012 as per Annexure-1, which is the

first information report in respect of the registration of the above

said crime. The Police, after investigation submitted Annexure-II

final report/charge sheet in Annexure-I crime, which has led to the

institution of Calendar Case, C.C.No.1645/2014 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-1, Alappuzha. The 1st

petitioner is the mother of the 2nd petitioner and the 3rd respondent

is the defacto complainant. The 3rd respondent had instituted

Annexure-III O.S.No.312/2012 before the Sub Court, Alappuzha for

recovery of an amount of Rs. 3,07,800/- including Rs.2 lakhs being

the alleged principal amount and Rs. 1,07.800/- being the alleged

interest against the petitioners, on 13.7.2012. The claim of the 3rd

Crl.M.C.5756/14                - : 2 :-

respondent is that the 1st petitioner had executed agreement for

sale on 14.7.2009 in respect of the property owned by the 1st

petitioner and    had received Rs. 2 lakhs as advance sale

consideration out of the alleged total sale consideration of Rs. 19.4

lakhs suppressing fact that there was attachment before judgment

on the property and not disclosing the fact that the property is free

from encumbrance or attachment. It is stated that the 1st petitioner

had filed Annexure- IV written statement dated 7.3.2013 in the

above said suit, contending that there was no agreement for sale

and that the alleged agreement for sale was fabricated and

concocted one. It is further stated that in the meanwhile, the 3rd

respondent filed the above said private criminal complaint before

the jurisdictional Magistrate alleging offence punishable under

Sec.420 read with Sec. 34 of the IPC, against the petitioners, which

was forwarded by the learned Magistrate to the police for

investigation under Sec. 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. Thereupon, the police

registered the impugned Annexure-I Crime No. 537/2012 of

Mannancherry Police Station, it is averred. Later on 25.11.2012 the

Police submitted impugned Annexure-II final report/charge sheet

without conducting any investigation and discarding the fact that

Crl.M.C.5756/14                  - : 3 :-

the entire issue involved as alleged by the 3rd respondent is only a

civil dispute and that the uncontroverted allegations do not

constitute any offence, it is averred. It is in the background of these

facts and circumstances that the petitioners have filed the above

captioned Criminal Miscellaneous Case seeking invocation of the

inherent powers conferred on this Court as per Sec. 482 of the

Cr.P.C. with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-II final

report/charge sheet in Crime No. 537/2012 of Mannancherry Police

Station, which has led to the institution of the Calendar Case,

C.C.No.1645/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-II, Alappuzha and all further proceedings arising therefrom

      2.     Heard Sri.V.N.Sankarjee, learned counsel apeparing for

the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the

respondent-State.

      3.     The learned counsel for the petitioners, during the

course of the submissions, relied on paragraph 61 of the decision of

the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Anr. reported

in (2013) 1 SCC (Cri.) 160 = (2012) 10 SCC 303, wherein it was held

that the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominantly

civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purpose of

Crl.M.C.5756/14                   - : 4 :-

quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or

the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the

family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in

nature etc. That in the instant case, the allegations arose solely out

of an alleged sale transaction in respect of a property and that the

impugned final report/charge sheet is liable to be quashed under

Sec.482 Cr.P.C. on account of the factual aspects stated

hereinabove. The Apex Court in aforementioned Gian Singh's case

cited supra, after surveying many rulings of the Apex Court on the

point, has categorically held that the inherent power of the High

Court under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. is of wide plenitude with no

statutory limitation and is to be exercised (i) to secure the ends of

justice, or (ii) to prevent the abuse of the process of any court (iii)

to do real, complete and substantial justice.        In Inder Mohan

Goswasmi v. State of Uttaranchal reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1, the

Apex Court has held that every High Court has the inherent powers

to act ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the

administration of which the court exists or to prevent abuse of

process of the court and it is contended by the learned counsel for

Crl.M.C.5756/14                 - : 5 :-

the petitioners that the principles laid down by the Apex Court in

those decisions would squarely apply in the facts of the present

case.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the prayer for

quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings. The learned

counsel for the petitioners then submitted that the petitioners may

be given the liberty to approach the court below with the plea for

discharge and the same may be directed to be considered and

further that they may be permitted to move an appropriate

application under Sec. 205 of the Cr.P.C. to exempt them from

personal appearance during the consideration of the plea of

discharge, till orders are passed thereon by the court below.

      5.     In the circumstances, it is ordered in the interest of

justice, that it is open to the petitioners to file appropriate

application seeking the plea of discharge in this case before the

court below and in case the stage for consideration of the plea of

discharge has not yet been crossed, then the court below shall

consider the same on merits and in accordance with law, after

reasonable opportunity to the petitioners and the prosecution. It is

further ordered in the interest of justice that in case the petitioners

Crl.M.C.5756/14                 - : 6 :-

file appropriate application under Sec. 205 of the Cr.P.C. seeking

exemption of their personal appearance from the court below

during the consideration of the plea of discharge until orders are

passed thereon, the court below shall consider the said prayer and

permit exemption from the personal appearance of the petitioners

during the stage of consideration of the discharge plea, until orders

are passed thereon.

      With these observations and directions, the Crl.M.C. stands

finally disposed of.

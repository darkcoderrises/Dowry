                   -------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                   -------------------------------
       Dated this the 24th day of September, 2014.


                           O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.57 of 2012 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikara,

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No.710 of 2010 of Mavelikara Police Station] for the offence

punishable under Section 406 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings pending against the petitioner

in the above calendar case, as the matter is settled out of

court.

       2.    The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner was the Director of Amala Foundation Educational

Consultancy, functioning at Madathil Building, Budha

Junction, Mavelikara and the petitioner from 28.5.2010

onwards, with an intention to deceive the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                                 2

complainant/2nd        respondent received    an    amount    of

Rs.12,73,500/- from the de facto complainant for arranging

an admission for her, for BDS in Navodaya Medical College

at Raychoor in Karnataka, but the petitioner/accused did not

arrange the admission and the amount received was not

returned back to the de facto complainant and thereby

committed criminal breach of trust to the de facto

complainant, as alleged by the prosecution. Now, the case

of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, which is

the subject matter of the above case, as per Annexure A3

affidavit sworn into by the 2nd respondent/de facto

complainant. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings

in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                                3

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and she has no grievance against the

petitioner.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 406 of

I.P.C. which is more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                                      4

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

2nd     respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant        has    no    further     grievance        against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:             the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power    given   to   a  criminal     court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute
         would depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But    the    criminal    cases      having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,        financial,   mercandile,        civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the

Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                                    5

         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process

of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

Crl.M.C.No.5373 of 2014
                                6

following the decision cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioner in

C.C.No.57 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Mavelikara, pursuant to Crime No.710 of 2010 of

Mavelikara Police Station.

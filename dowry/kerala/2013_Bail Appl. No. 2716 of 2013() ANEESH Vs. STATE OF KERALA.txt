             -------------------------------------------
                      B.A.No.2716 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 26th day of April, 2013

                              ORDER

      The petitioners are accused in Crime No.461/2013 of

Paravoor Police Station, Kollam which is registered under

Sections 498A, 306 and 34 IPC r/w Section 3(1)(X) of SC/ST

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The prosecution case is that on

9.3.2012, the 1st petitioner married the deceased Aswathy at

Polachira Gurukulam Mahavishnu Temple and both of them

resided together in a rented house. In the meantime, the 1st

petitioner went abroad in search of a job and employed there.

The 1st petitioner returned on leave on 8.03.2013, the deceased

visited his house, at that time, the petitioners abused her by

calling her 'caste' name in the general public and instigating her

to commit suicide. On the basis of that, on 29.3.2013, between

8.30 a.m. and 7.30 p.m., she committed suicide. On the basis of

the information, Paravoor Police registered the above crime and

proceeded with investigation. The petitioners were arrested and

B.A.No2716/13                    2

produced before the Court on 20.3.2013 and remanded to

judicial custody, their bail application was dismissed by the

Munsiff Magistrate, S.Paravur, Kollam, hence, they approached

this Court for bail.

      2.    Heard both sides. The learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners contended that after one month of the

marriage, the matrimonial relationship between the 1st

petitioner and the deceased Aswathy became strained and

thereafter, they never met each other and there was no

allegation of demand of dowry or any physical harassment.

The 2nd petitioner, who is the mother of the 1st petitioner,

having acute diabetic and other diseases. The 3rd petitioner

is the mother of a baby. The petitioners are ready to obey any

conditions imposed by this Court, hence, they pray for bail.

      3.    The   learned   Public  Prosecutor    submits     that

investigation is progressing.     The 4th accused is not yet

arrested. If the petitioners are enlarged on bail, definitely they

will associate with the 4th accused and which will tamper the

prosecution evidence.

      3.    I have considered the nature and gravity of the

B.A.No2716/13                     3

allegation.   The 1st petitioner is the husband and the 2nd

petitioner is the mother. I have perused the statement of the

deceased wife.     Serious allegations are levelled against the

1stpetitioner and his mother. It is admitted that the deceased

and the petitioner were married and resided together only for

one month, even after that, the 1st petitioner went abroad in

search of a job and employed there. When he came back to

the native place, he was not agreed to reside with his wife.

When she went to his house, he ousted her from his house and

subsequently, instigated her to commit suicide.              The

investigation is progressing. Witnesses were questioned. The

postmortem report shows that the death was due to hanging.

The Professor of Forensic Laboratory, Thiruvananthaupram

issued the certificate. Having regard to the gravity and nature

of offence, I am of the opinion that, if petitioners Nos.1 and 2

enlarged on bail, it will affect the prosecution.        In the

circumstance, the 3rd petitioner is enlarged on bail according to

the following stringent conditions:

             i)    The 3rd petitioner   shall execute a

       bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees twenty five thousand

B.A.No2716/13                     4

       only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

       amount to the satisfaction of Munsiff Magistrate,

       S.Paravur, Kollam.

             ii)  The 3rd petitioner shall not commit

       any offence similar to the offence of which she is

       accused of during this period.

             iii) The 3rd petitioner shall not make any

       inducement, threat or promise to any person or

       influence, incite or intimidate any prosecution

       witnesses directly or indirectly acquainted with

       the facts of the case.

             iv)  The 3rd petitioner shall make herself

       available for interrogation during this period as

       and when required by the investigating officer.

             v)   The 3rd petitioner shall not tamper

       with the prosecution evidence during bail.

     The above conditions are imposed for preventing the

escape of the accused or preventing repetition of the offence in

the interest of justice. If the 3rd petitioner violates any of the

above conditions, the bail granted to her shall be liable to be

B.A.No2716/13                     5

cancelled by this Court. It shall be open for the investigating

officer to approach this court for cancellation of the bail. The

bail application of petitioners 1 and 2 are rejected.

      The bail application is disposed of as above.




                                      P.D. RAJAN, JUDGE.

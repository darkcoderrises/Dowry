                     WP(CR) No. 368 of 2015
                ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 31st day of August, 2015

                             JUDGMENT

Abdul Rehim,J.




      The petitioner is the father of a girl aged 22 years viz.

Revathy Chandran.       He is approaching this court based on

allegation that Miss Revathy Chandran is missing from his house

since 6.5.2015 onwards. It is stated that a complaint was lodged

before the 4th respondent with respect to the missing of the

petitioner's daughter, based on which Ext.P2 case was registered

by the 4th respondent under section 57 of the Kerala Police Act.

It is averred in the writ petition that the 4th respondent had

taken the 1st respondent into custody and produced him before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II, Attingal. The learned

Magistrate recorded the statement of the petitioner's daughter

and due to the threat from the side of respondents 1 and 2 she

gave a statement supporting the 1st respondent. Hence the

learned Magistrate allowed the 1st respondent to take the

WP(CR)368/2015                  2

petitioner's daughter along with him. It is complained that the

petitioner's daughter is being  harassed under illegal custody by

respondents 1 and 2, demanding dowry and that she was not

allowed to visit her parental home.       It is alleged that the

petitioner's daughter had contacted her brother over telephone

and narrated all the incidents of harassment, both physical and

mental    which she is suffering from respondents 1 and 2.

Eventhough the petitioner approached the 4th respondent with a

complaint under Ext.P3 narrating the above facts, no action was

taken , is the allegation. Based on a specific contention that the

petitioner's daughter Miss. Revathy Chandran is under illegal

confinement of respondents 1 and 2, this writ petition is filed

seeking a writ of habeas corpus for directing her production and

for handing over her custody to the petitioner.

      2. Based on notice issued from this court respondents 1

and 2 appeared through counsel.       Respondents 1 and 2 are

personally present along with the alleged detenu.       We have

interacted with the alleged detenu independently.   She said that

she was studying in the last semester for B.Sc Computer Science

in UAT College, Pirappancode.    According to her, 6.5.2015 was

WP(CR)368/2015                  3

the last day of her college and there was a farewell party

arranged at the college.   But the 1st respondent instructed her

not to go to the college on that day and to come to a particular

place, otherwise it was threatened that the 1st respondent will do

away with the petitioner. According to her, when she met the 1st

respondent on 6.5.2015, she was taken by the 1st respondent to

a friend's house. On the morning of 7.5.2015 a marriage was

solemnised under compulsion, at a temple at Alammoodu.

Subsequently she was taken before the 4th respondent on the

premise that a missing case was registered.     On 7.5.2015 she

was produced before the Magistrate Court at Attingal.      At that

time, the 1st respondent had compelled her to give statement

before the Magistrate to the extent that she wants to go along

with him. Accordingly, due to threat and compulsion, she gave a

statement before the Magistrate that she wants to go along with

the 1st   respondent.      According to   the    alleged detenu,

subsequently the marriage was registered before the Marriage

Registering Officer at Thiruvananthapuram Corporation.        The

alleged detenu categorically stated that her life in the residence

of the 1st respondent    is highly miserable    that she is being

WP(CR)368/2015                    4

harassed demanding more dowry.           It is also mentioned that

the attitude   and approach of the family members of the 1st

respondent has changed and she happened to stay there only

because of threat and coercion from the side of the 1st

respondent and his family members.       She expressed her strong

desire to go along with the petitioner to her parental house.

      3.  On the basis of the statement given by the alleged

detenu, we directed the alleged detenu to have interaction with

the petitioner and her mother, who are present before this court.

we have also interacted with the petitioner personally.        He

expressed willingness to take the alleged detenu along with him

to the parental house, as desired by her.         Learned counsel

appearing for respondents 1 and 2 have denied all             the

allegations made by the alleged detenu. It is stated that she had

voluntarily left her parental house based on a specific decision

taken for having marriage with the 1st respondent.         All the

allegations of harassment    and torturing made by the alleged

detenu was stoutly denied .        It is pointed out that a valid

marriage was solemnised between the alleged detenu and the

1st respondent on 7.5.2015 at "Padinjare Sree Durga Bhagavathy

WP(CR)368/2015                    5

Temple," Kulathoor, Thiruvananthapuram.        It is also mentioned

that the said marriage was registered before the Local Authority

under provisions of the Kerala Registration of Marriages

(Common) Rules 2008.         Learned counsel had produced the

Certificate of Marriage for our perusal, which would indicate that

the marriage solemnised in the above said temple on 7.5.2015

was registered before the Local Registrar Thiruvananthapuram

Corporation on 19.5.2015.

      4.    In this writ petition we are concerned only with the

aspect of illegal detention against free will of the alleged detenu.

The alleged detenu, when interacted by this court, had

specifically mentioned that she is now being detained in the

house of respondents 1 and 2 against          her free will.    She

expressed her strong desire to go along with the petitioner to her

parental house . Under such circumstance this court is bound to

pass an order setting her at liberty, to permit her to reside at

any place of her choice. We make it clear that this court is not

going into any adjudication on the disputes relating to the marital

relationship of the alleged detenu and the 1st respondent.        It

will be left open to the parties to seek appropriate remedy

WP(CR)368/2015                   6

regarding such disputes if any, before the appropriate forum.

      5.    Under the above mentioned circumstance the writ

petition is disposed of by setting the alleged detenu Miss.Revathy

Chandran at liberty to go along with the petitioner and to reside

at her parental house, as per her desire.

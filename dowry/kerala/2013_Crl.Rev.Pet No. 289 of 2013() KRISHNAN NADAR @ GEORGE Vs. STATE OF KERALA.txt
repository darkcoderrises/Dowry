                  Crl.R.P. No. 289 of 2013
                 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
           Dated this the 6th day of February, 2013.

                                ORDER



          Aggrieved by the concurrent findings                  of the

courts below regarding the right of the petitioner before

the JFCM Court to reside in the shared household, the

respondent before the said court has come up in revision.

          2. Shorn off unnecessary details, the case of the

petitioner before the trial court was that she had also

contributed considerable sum for the construction of the

building Kavya Bhavan along with her husband and she has

a right to reside in the said house as it is a shared

household. There are allegations of the respondent before

the trial court having demanded dowry and also having

treated her cruelly.

          3.   The respondent resisted the petition by

pointing out that the petitioner has a building of her own

named S.K.Sadanam and that the allegation that she had

contributed to the construction of the house Kavya Bhavan

Crl.R.P.289/2013.              2

was not true and that Kavya Bhavan put up with with the

sole funds of the respondent.

             4.  Before the trial court, the parties adduced

evidence. The evidence consists of the testimony of P.Ws.1

and 2 and documents marked as Exts.P1 to P12 from the

side of the petitioner. The respondent examined himself as

D.W.1 and had Exts. D1 to D14 marked. On a consideration

of the materials before it, the trial court came to the

conclusion that the funds for the construction of Kavya

Bhavan was contributed by the petitioner also and that was

a shared household as far as the couple was concerned and

she had a right to reside in the said house and had passed

an order accordingly.

             5. The respondent carried the matter in appeal as

Crl.Appeal 509 of 2011 before the Sessions Court,

Thiruvananthapuram.       The appellate court, after        an

independent consideration of the materials before it and

finding that the finding of the trial court is fully justified,

Crl.R.P.289/2013.              3

confirmed the order. That brings the respondent before

this court.

             6. The power of revision is considerably limited.

Unless it is shown that there is illegality, irregularity and

impropriety in the impugned order, it may not be proper for

this court to interfere with the finding of the court below.

Merely because a different view may be possible, it is well

settled that, interference is not called for.

             7. Both the courts below have found that funds

for the construction of Kavya Bhavan was contributed by

the petitioner before the trial court also.      Evidence is

furnished by P.Ws.1 and 2. P.W.2 is none other than the

mother of the respondent.

             8. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

pointed out that going by Section 3 of Protection of Women

from Domestic Violence Act, unless there is necessity, the

question of enforcing right on shared household does not

arise for consideration. In the case on hand, the petitioner

Crl.R.P.289/2013.             4

before the trial court has got a house of her own and she

does not require to reside in Kavya Bhavan at all. It is also

pointed out that the stand of the respondent before the trial

court was that the family house was the shared household

and by no stretch of imagination, Kavya Bhavan cannot be

treated as a shared household. As far as the evidence of

P.W.2, it is pointed out that the petitioner herein had

instituted proceedings against his mother and that had

annoyed her and that had resulted in her deposing against

the respondent before the trial court.

             9. On going through the counter affidavit of the

respondent before the trial court, it can be seen that after

the construction of Kavya Bhavan was over, his claim that

he has invited the petitioner before the trial court to reside

with him. That would clearly indicate that it is intended to

be a shared household. The evidence had been analysed by

both the courts below and both the courts have accepted

the evidence adduced by P.Ws.1 and 2 to hold that the

Crl.R.P.289/2013.              5

funds for the construction of Kavya Bhavan was contributed

by the petitioner before the trial court also.

             10. The contention based on Section 3 has no

basis. Section 17 gives the right to the aggrieved party to

the shared household. As already noticed, on the basis of

the materials available, it is clear that Kavya Bhavan is a

shared household. The mere fact that the petitioner before

the trial court has a house of her own does not preclude her

from enforcing her rights under Section 17 of the Act.

             11. Considering the facts and circumstances of

the case, it is clear that there is no error committed by the

court below in coming to the conclusion that Kavya Bhavan

is a shared household.

             12. Even though the petitioner tried to establish

that he has rented out Kavya Bhavan, both the courts below

were not inclined to accept the said claim of the petitioner.

Admittedly, a lady is residing there. The petitioner before

the trial court has a case that she is the mistress of the

Crl.R.P.289/2013.              6

respondent, whereas the respondent has a case that she is

the daughter of the person to whom the building is rented

out. Whatever that be, there appears to be no error in the

order of the courts below. The petitioner before the trial

court is entitled to have a right of residence in the shared

household.

             After having elaborately heard the counsel,this

court finds no ground to interfere with the finding of the

court below.

             This Revision is without merits and it is

accordingly dismissed.




                                          P. BHAVADASAN,
                                               JUDGE

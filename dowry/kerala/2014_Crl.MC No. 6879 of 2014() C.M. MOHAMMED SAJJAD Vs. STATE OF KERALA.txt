                   Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014
                 ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014.

                            O R D E R


     The prayer in this Crl.M.C is to quash all further

proceedings    in   the   impugned       Annexure   A-1  Crime

No.887/2009 of Kasargod Police Station. The said crime has

been registered for offences punishable under Secs. 143, 147,

148, 323, 324, 452, 427, 308, 153(A) r/w 149 IPC which has

registered on the basis of complaint lodged by the 2nd

respondent.    The prosecution case is that on 6.12.2009 at

about 12:30 hrs, the 1st accused and 20 other Muslim

identifiable youths have formed themselves in to an unlawful

assembly, assaulted 2nd respondent with wooden sticks by

committing criminal trespass in to the courtyard of this house,

caused damage to the window glass and criminal mischief and

thus committed the offence.        It is stated that the police

arrested the accused and that they are released on bail. It is

submitted that the entire disputes between the petitioners and

2nd respondent (defacto complainant) has been settled. The

2nd respondent has sworn to an affidavit dated 14.11.2014

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

produced as Annexure A-2 in this Crl.M.C.       Therein the 2nd

respondent has stated that though the police arrested the

accused and accused were released on bail and those really

involved in the above case were not traceable and those

arrested in the case are not the real persons in the above case.

It is further stated in Annexure A-2 affidavit that the issues

between the petitioners and 2nd respondent are settled due to

mediators and well wishers and that the 2nd respondent has no

further grievances against the petitioners and that he has no

further grievances or complaints against them in view of the

settlement and that further continuation of the impugned

criminal proceedings against the petitioners in the above case

would seriously affect the harmonious relationship between the

parties and that the 2nd respondent has no personal grievances

against the petitioners/accused in the above case and that the

impugned criminal proceedings may be quashed. It is stated

that accused Nos.2, 3 and 6 to 8 are students and accused

Nos.1 & 3 are youth employed in petty trades and none of

them are connected with the incident and they they were

implicated on misunderstanding.      It is in the light of these

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

aspects, that the petitioner has filed the instant Crl.M.C

seeking invocation of the inherent powers conferred on this

Court under Sec. 482 Cr.P.C with the prayer to quash the

impugned Annexure A-1 FIR in Crime No.887/2009 of

Kasaragod Police Station and all further proceedings arising

therefrom.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.K.A.Anish,

Advocate, has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and the

learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.K.K.Mohamed Ravuf, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.K.A.Anish, learned counsel

appearing for the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between

the parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both

parties as the real disputants to the controversy have arrived

                              ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money     and   would    unnecessarily    strain  the  judicial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.K.A.Anish, learned counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the

petitioners and that he has no objection in the quashment of

the    impugned     criminal   proceedings     and   that  the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners as he has no grievance against

them and that they will not raise any dispute/complaint in

future if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is

allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

                                   ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

      7.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for the 2nd

respondent,      it    is   clear     to    the     Court     that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

            "61.    The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may     quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
       public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
       such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
       about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
       hesitate to quash them".

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

                               ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.6879 Of 2014

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure A-1 FIR in Crime No.887/2009 of Kasaragod Police

Station and all further proceedings arising therefrom stand

quashed, in the interest of justice.      The petitioners shall

produce certified copies of this order before the Station House

Officer concerned as well as before the court below concerned.

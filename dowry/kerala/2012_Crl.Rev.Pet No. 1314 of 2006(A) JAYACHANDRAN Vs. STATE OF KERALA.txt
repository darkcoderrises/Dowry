               ------------------------------------
        Dated this the 29th day of October 2012


                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are the husband and mother-in-law of the

de facto complainant, who was examined as PW1 before the

court below. PW2 and PW3 are the father and brother of

PW1. Petitioners were convicted by the courts below for

offence punishable under Sec.498A r/w 34 IPC.           The

appellate court modified the sentence to R.I. for one year to

the first petitioner and R.I. for six months to the 2nd

petitioner. Besides, a sum of Rs.5,000/- each was ordered

as fine which if paid was directed to be paid to the

complainant as compensation. That part of the sentence

was confirmed by the appellate court.

     2.   Learned counsel for the petitioners has argued

with vehemence that there is no legal evidence to hold that

the petitioners have committed the offence under Sec.498A

Crl.R.P. No.1314 of 2006

                              -: 2 :-

IPC. It is also contended that though letters were stated to

have been sent by PW1 to her father, those letters were not

produced. Similarly, though PW1 contended that when she

sustained injury as she was beaten by her husband, she was

taken to the hospital by the wife of the landlord of the

building occupied by she and her husband, that lady was

also not examined.       Therefore, according to the learned

counsel for the petitioners, in the absence of any

independent witness, the sole testimony given by PW1

should not have been accepted to hold the petitioners

guilty.

      3.    Learned Public Prosecutor would submit that

there is evidence in abundance to hold that when PW1 was

staying at her matrimonial house at Olavakkode along with

the petitioners, she was subjected to physical and mental

cruelty by the first petitioner demanding more money and

gold ornaments as dowry.          It was alleged that the 2nd

petitioner (mother-in-law) also had insulted and abused

Crl.R.P. No.1314 of 2006

                              -: 3 :-

raising the very same allegation. There is also evidence to

show that when PW1 started residing with the first

petitioner at Aluva, she was beaten and strangled by the

first accused demanding more gold and money. There is

also evidence to show that the gold ornaments belonging to

PW1 were taken away by the first accused. The learned

counsel submits that though PW1 stated that she was

beaten on her face and the accused attempted to strangle

her and stamped on her abdomen when she was examined

by the doctor at the Government Hospital, no such injury

was seen by the doctor.

      4.    Two courts below have analysed the evidence

regarding the physical and mental cruelty with which PW1

was subjected to at the hands of A1. The contention that no

independent witness was examined to prove the cruelty and

so, the finding is to be set aside is devoid of any merit since

such matrimonial cruelties take place with in the four walls

of the house and it will not be done in the presence of

Crl.R.P. No.1314 of 2006

                            -: 4 :-

neighbours, guests or strangers. A woman usually will not

complain to other persons about the cruelty of her husband

or in-laws.      Normally she would complain only to her

parents or brothers. Here, PW2 and PW3, her father and

brother have given evidence in support of the evidence

given by PW1 that her husband (A1) had tortured her.. The

evidence to that effect given by PW1 was properly

appreciated by the courts below to hold that A1 had

subjected the complainant (PW1) to physical and mental

cruelty. The fact that the gold ornaments given to her were

taken away by the accused and converted it to his own use

is also another act of cruelty.      Therefore, the finding

entered against A1 is only to be confirmed.

      5.    Learned counsel has pointed out that though

there is a solitary sentence in the evidence given by PW1

that she was subjected to mental cruelty by the 2nd

petitioner also, when A2 was staying with PW1, her

statement in cross examination would show that she was

Crl.R.P. No.1314 of 2006

                                -: 5 :-

not subjected to physical cruelty by A2 when PW1 was

staying at Olavakkode.        No doubt, physical cruelty itself

need not be proved to attract the offence under Sec.498A.

It is sufficient if there is evidence to show that the wife was

subjected to mental cruelty. Even if it is accepted that one

or two occasions when PW1 was staying at Olavakkode, A2

had abused PW1 complaining of inadequacy of gold or

money given at the time of marriage it cannot be said that

there was persistent demand and continuous act of cruelty

so as to hold A2 guilty of the offence punishable under

Sec.498A.      In other words, the act complained of against

A2 is not one which was likely drive PW1 to commit suicide.

Therefore, I find that the finding of guilt entered against A2

is liable to be set aside.

      6.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that

the sentence awarded on the first petitioner may be

reduced taking into consideration that the incident took

place long back. Considering all the aspects, I find that the

Crl.R.P. No.1314 of 2006

                               -: 6 :-

sentence can be modified to a certain extent.

            In the result, this Crl.R.P. is disposed of as stated

below :-

            The conviction and sentence passed against the

2nd petitioner are set aside. She is set at liberty.

            The verdict of conviction entered against the first

accused (first petitioner) is confirmed. In supersession of

the sentence awarded by the courts below, the first

petitioner is sentenced to undergo S.I. for six months and to

pay Rs.10,000/- as compensation to PW1 and in default of

payment of the same, he will undergo S.I. for three months.

                                                       JUDGE.

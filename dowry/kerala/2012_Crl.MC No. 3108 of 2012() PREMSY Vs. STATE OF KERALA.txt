               Crl.M.C. NO. 3108 of 2012
          ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 04th day of October, 2012

                           ORDER


           Petitioner is the de facto complainant in a crime

case registered at Ponkunnam Police Station which is now

pending investigation. In that complaint she imputed

matrimonial cruelty and harassment by her husband, his

mother and his Sister, demanding dowry. Crime registered

for the offence under Section 498A read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code is presently investigated by the Sub

Inspector of the above Station.    Annexure-I, is copy of FIR

in the crime.    After registration of the crime the spouses

have resolved the disputes, and the petitioner/de facto

complainant is no longer interested in prosecuting her

husband and his close relatives, is the submission of the

learned counsel for petitioner. It is further submitted that

pursuant to settlement resolving the matrimonial disputes,

the spouses are living together. Submission made as above

Crl.M.C. NO. 3108 of 2012          2



is endorsed by learned counsel appearing for respondents

3 to 5, who are proceeded as the accused in the crime.

Learned Public Prosecutor who was instructed to ascertain

the correctness of the representation made that the spouses

are living together has reported that on enquiry through the

Investigating Officer it is found true and correct.     Having

regard to the nature of the offence imputed which has arisen

from the matrimonial disputes of the spouses at this stage

where the spouses are stated to be living together resolving

all their disputes, I find continuation of the criminal

proceedings against the accused persons will not be

conducive to justice. Any continuation of such proceedings

may only impair the renewed matrimonial relationship of the

spouses. Though the offence imputed is non-bailable, and

not compoundable even with the permission of the court if

any report indicting the accused persons is filed after

investigation, still, as the offence imputed is shown to be one

arising out of the matrimonial relationship of the spouses

and thus could be treated as personal and not affecting the

Crl.M.C. NO. 3108 of 2012         3



general public at large, I find invoking of the inherent powers

of this court to quash the criminal proceedings against the

respondents 3 to 5 in the case is called for to secure the

ends of justice. In that view of the matter the crime

registered on Annexure-I F.I.R and further proceedings

thereof against the respondents 3 to 5, the accused named,

are quashed under Section 482         of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 7087 of 2014
             =======================
            Dated this the 12th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R



      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1118 of 2013 of the

Thrissur East Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 Final

Report in Crime No.1118 of 2013 of the Thrissur East Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.279 of

2013 pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,

Thrissur, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is his wife,

and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A

IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

Crl.M.C. No. 7087 of 2014
                                2

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in

Crl.M.C. No. 7087 of 2014
                                  3

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1 FIR

and Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.1118 of 2013 of the

Thrissur East Police Station and all further proceedings based

on it in C.C.No.279 of 2013 pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate's Court, Thrissur, are hereby quashed.



                                                 Sd/-
                                     B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

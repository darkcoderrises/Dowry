               O.P. (Crl) NO. 2006 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 27th day of July, 2012

                         JUDGMENT


           Petitioner is the accused in C.C. No.2032/2006 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam. He is

being prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section

498A of the Indian Penal Code. His wife committed suicide in

1999. A complaint given by his father-in-law that her death

was on account of the cruelty inflicted by him demanding

dowry, the crime was registered and, later, after investigation

he was indicted of the offence as aforesaid.            Though

cognizance of the offence in the report was taken by the

Magistrate   in   2006,   evidently,  the    petitioner/accused

appeared before the court only in 2011. Learned counsel for

the petitioner submits that non receipt of the summons issued

from the court caused delay in his appearance since he had

shifted his residence to Tamil Nadu. Now on every posting

date he is coming from that far off place to attend the court,

O.P. (Crl) NO. 2006 of 2012       2



but there is delay in completion of the trial as the prosecution

could not secure      the presence of material witnesses, is the

submission of the counsel. Some of the material witnesses

CW 1-5 even after repeated summons have not appeared

before the court, nor even the summons served on them so

far. Petitioner is therefore put to severe hardship and injury,

is the submission of the counsel. He seeks for issue of

directions     to  the   Magistrate  to  complete     the   trial

expeditiously. A report from the Magistrate was called for.

The report would indicate that delay in completion of the trial

is for the reason that the presence of witnesses CW 1-5 could

not be secured so far.          Where the trial has already

commenced a year back in a crime registered in 1999, the

delay caused in its completion for the reason that the

presence of some of the material witnesses         could not be

secured even after several postings cannot at all be an

excuse. The Magistrate shall take necessary steps for service

of summons to CW 1-5, and, if service still could not be

effected after taking steps he has to decide further course of

O.P. (Crl) NO. 2006 of 2012     3



action in accordance with law, to secure the presence of the

aforesaid witnesses      for a speedy trial of the case. The

Magistrate shall make every endeavour to complete the trial

expeditiously, after taking necessary steps to secure the

presence of the material witnesses.   If prosecution fails to

furnish necessary assistance to effect service on material

witnesses that has to be viewed seriously for passing

appropriate orders in proceeding further with the trial for its

speedy completion.

            Subject to the above observations, the petition is

closed.

                   Dated this the 4th day of March 2015

                                      ORDER


      Petition under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

      2. Petitioners are accused nos.1 and 2 in crime No.340/2015

of Aluva East police station registered for the offences punishable

under sections 498A, 342, 323 and 506(ii) read with section 34 of

the I.P.C. The allegations against the petitioner is that they have

tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is the wife of

the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty, within the meaning

of section of 498A of IPC., by demanding more dowry and gold

ornaments after misappropriating the entire gold ornaments and

money. It is also alleged that on 26.1.2015 the first petitioner

B.A.1022/2015                     2

slapped and fisted the de facto complainant and intimidated her by

showing knife and she was confined in a room. When the mother

of the de facto complainant came on knowing about it, she was

also beaten up, kicked and stamped by the first petitioner.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      4.   No criminal antecedents have been reported against the

petitioners. The contents of the CD, reveal that the investigation

of the case is practically over. I do not think that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is required for the continued

investigation of this case. Over and above it, being a matrimonial

offence, this court is of the view that there is a possibility of

settlement in the matter and reunion of the parties. Considering all

the above and in the absence of criminal antecedents on the part of

the petitioners, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

B.A.1022/2015                       3

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge the petitioners on

bail in the event of their arrest on each of them executing a bond

for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent

sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and        subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the
      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on
      all Wednesdays and Saturdays, commencing               from
      11.3.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing
      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii) The petitioners shall not tamper with the
      evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves
      available for interrogation as and when required by the
      investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any
      offence while on bail.

B.A.1022/2015                      4

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

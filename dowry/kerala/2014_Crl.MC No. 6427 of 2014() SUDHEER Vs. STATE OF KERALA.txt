          Dated this the 21st day of November, 2014

                               O R D E R
                               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

          Petitioner is the accused in C.C. No.483/2012 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad,

which has arisen from Crime No.26/2012 of Vattappara

Police Station for the offence punishable under Section

498A IPC.

      2.  The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

his wife, by demanding more dowry and that he has

misappropriated her entire gold ornaments and money and

has not cared to maintain the de facto complainant and the

child. Presently, the matter has been settled between the

parties amicably and at present, the de facto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner.

      3.  The de facto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit stating that all the

Crl.M.C.6427/2014
                               : 2 :



matrimonial disputes have been settled between her and the

petitioner out of court and the parties have filed a petition for

divorce by mutual consent before the Family Court,

Nedumangad. According to the 2nd respondent, she does

not want to proceed with the case. The 2nd respondent has

entered appearance through her counsel. The learned

counsel for the 2nd respondent also admits the affidavit

sworn by the de facto complainant herself. When all the

disputes have been settled between the parties and when

the parties do not want to proceed with the matter, it is just

and expedient in the interest of justice to quash all further

proceedings in C.C.No.483/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in C.C.No.483/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad are quashed.

        DATED THIS THE 8th DAY OF OCTOBER, 2015

                         J U D G M E N T


Mary Joseph, J:

     The petitioner who is father of Mrs. Lubna N.P. has

approached this court seeking for the issuance of writ of

Habeas Corpus directing respondents 2 to 4 to produce his

daughter, who is alleged to be in illegal detention of the 1st

respondent, who is her husband. It is alleged in the petition

as follows:

     2.   Mrs. Lubna N.P., who is the daughter of the

petitioner was married to the 1st respondent in May, 2013.

At the time of marriage 100 sovereigns of gold, one Acre of

land and one Swift car were given to the 1st respondent and

his daughter by the petitioner. For the initial six months

after the marriage, the 1st respondent was very cordial to

the daughter of the petitioner. Thereafter he started making

illegal demands for more money and property for which the

W.P.(Crl.) No. 413/2015                -2-


petitioner was not amenable and thereupon the 1st

respondent started ill-treating the daughter of the

petitioner.

          3.       The 1st respondent is working abroad and when he

was there in connection with his employment, the daughter

of the petitioner was allowed to stay at the parental home.

The 1st respondent was not interested in visiting the house

of the petitioner even when he was on leave. The 1st

respondent did not even allow the petitioner's daughter

then to attend any function in the family of the petitioner.

Not even she was permitted to attend phonecalls made by

the petitioner. It is alleged that for the last 10 months there

was absolutely no contact or communication between the

petitioner's family with the 1st respondent and his wife.

          4.       While so, in early June, 2015 the petitioner

approached the 2nd respondent and lodged a complaint

alleging that he is not allowed to see or contact his only

daughter. It is alleged in the complaint that daughter of the

petitioner was kept in illegal custody by the 1st respondent.

Following the lodging of the complaint the 1st respondent

W.P.(Crl.) No. 413/2015                 -3-


and the daughter of the petitioner were summoned by the

police to the police station. The 1st respondent did not allow

the petitioner's daughter to speak out the truth regarding

her illegal confinement and the cruelty extended by him. In

the talk held at the police station an amicable arrangement

was arrived whereby, the petitioner was permitted to visit

the house of the 1st respondent and to meet his daughter as

and when desired. In accordance with the terms of

arrangements arrived at the police station the petitioner

went to the house of the 1st respondent and was permitted

to meet his daughter. But when he went to the house of the

1st respondent again to seek his daughter/the 1st respondent

scolded the petitioner with filthy languages and threatened

him stating that if he further visits the house himself as well

as his daughter would have to face severe consequences.

Considering the welfare of his daughter the petitioner

stopped visiting the house of the 1st respondent thereafter.

          5.       It is now learnt by the petitioner from a neighbour

of the 1st respondent that his daughter is illegally detained

and confined in the first floor of the house of the 1st

W.P.(Crl.) No. 413/2015             -4-


respondent without being permitted to go even downstairs

of the house. It is also told by the neighbour of the 1st

respondent to the petitioner that his daughter is not even

allowed to make any phone calls. The petitioner expressed

his apprehension that if no effort is made to save his

daughter from the clutches of the 1st respondent and his

family members, the life of his daughter would be

endangered. It is in the said circumstances that the

petitioner has approached this court alleging illegal

detention and confinement of his daughter by the 1st

respondent and seeking to set her free.

          6.       On 01-10-2015 when the writ petition came up for

admission learned Government Pleader entered appearance

for respondents 2 to 4. The 2nd respondent was directed by

this court to conduct a discreet enquiry regarding the

allegations contained in the writ petition. The 2nd

respondent was also directed to get an independent

statement of the daughter of the petitioner recorded

through a woman police officer out of presence of the

1st respondent or any of his family members.

W.P.(Crl.) No. 413/2015            -5-


          7.       This day, when the case is taken up, learned

Government Pleader has placed before us a report obtained

from the 2nd respondent alongwith the statement of the

alleged detenue recorded by the woman police officer.

          8.       We have gone through the statement of the

alleged detenue and found therefrom that she is not under

illegal detention or confinement by the 1st respondent. The

statement of the alleged detenue reveals that she is living

with the 1st respondent happily and was not under any

harassments. According to her the petitioner had given 100

sovereigns of gold and one Swift car to her at the time of

marriage. The 1st respondent was against receiving dowry

and therefore, those were returned to the petitioner. The

aforesaid act of the 1st respondent, made the petitioner to

be out of cordial terms with 1st respondent. On 22-11-2014

when the alleged detenue alongwith her husband visited the

house of the petitioner the brother of the alleged detenue

beat her husband, and therefore the alleged detenue

alongwith her husband returned to her matrimonial home.

Thereafter they refrained from visiting her parental home

W.P.(Crl.) No. 413/2015               -6-


any more. The alleged detenue and her husband were

staying at Abudabi and it is only in the month of May, 2015,

she returned back to her matrimonial home for delivery.

According to her neither the 1st respondent nor any of his

family members had detained her and ill-treated her at any

point of time.

          9.       From the statement of the alleged detenue we are

convinced that the allegations of the petitioner are without

bonafides. The alleged detenue was not under illegal

detention or confinement of the 1st respondent or his family

members. Therefore, absolutely no reason is existing,

warranting our interference further in the matter.

           In the result the writ petition is dismissed.

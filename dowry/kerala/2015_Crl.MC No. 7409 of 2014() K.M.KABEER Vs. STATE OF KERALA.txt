              Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2015
     ------------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of June, 2015

                           ORDER

     The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.537 of

2014 of Cusba Police Station, Palakkad.             The above

crime was registered against the petitioner for the

offences punishable under Sec.354 of the Indian Penal

Code and Sec.7 of the Protection of Children from

Sexual Offences Act, 2012.              The 2nd        and 3rd

respondents are the mother and father of the victim.

The respondent No.2 is the de facto complainant.

Now the entire disputes between the petitioner and

respondents 2 and 3 are settled out of court.              They

have no subsisting grievance at all and they do not

want to proceed with the prosecution against the

petitioner.     Annexures-B and C are the affidavits

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014       -: 2 :-


sworn by the respondents 2 and 3 in this respect.      In

view of the settlement, the petitioner prayed for

quashing the prosecution against the petitioner under

Annexure-A First Information Report in exercise of the

jurisdiction under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C., in view of the

decision in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)].

      2. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench

of the Apex Court, on a reference, considered the

question whether the High Court has power to quash

criminal    proceedings     involving   non-compoundable

offences on the basis of the compromise reached

between the offender and the victim and answered as

given below:

            "57. The position that emerges from

            the    above    discussion    can    be

            summarised thus: the power of the

            High Court in quashing a criminal

            proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

            exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014         -: 3 :-

            distinct and different from the power

            given     to  a   criminal     court   for

            compounding      the    offences    under

            S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

            of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in

            accord with the guideline engrafted in

            such power viz;(1) to secure the ends

            of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

            the process of any Court.         In what

            cases power to quash the criminal

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may

            be exercised where the offender and

            victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and

            circumstances of each case and no

            category      can     be       prescribed.

            However, before exercise of such

            power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of

            the crime.       Heinous and serious

            offences    of  mental       depravity or

            offences like murder, rape, dacoity,

            etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

            though the victim or victim's family

            and the offender have settled the

            dispute. Such offences are not private

            in nature and have serious impact on

            society.    Similarly, any compromise

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014        -: 4 :-

            between the victim and offender in

            relation to the offences under special

            statutes like Prevention of Corruption

            Act or the offences committed by

            public servants while working in that

            capacity etc; cannot provide for any

            basis      for    quashing      criminal

            proceedings involving such offences.

            But     the  criminal     cases  having

            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

            civil flavour stand on different footing

            for    the   purposes      of quashing,

            particularly the offences arising from

            commercial,     financial,   mercantile,

            civil,   partnership    or   such   like

            transactions or the offences arising

            out of matrimony relating to dowry,

            etc., or the family disputes where the

            wrong is basically private or personal

            in nature and the parties          have

            resolved their entire dispute. In this

            category of cases, High Court may

            quash criminal proceedings if in its

            view, because of the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and

            bleak and continuation of criminal

            case would put accused to great

            oppression      and     prejudice   and

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014         -: 5 :-

            extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal

            case     despite  full    and  complete

            settlement and compromise with the

            victim. In other words, the High Court

            must consider whether it would be

            unfair or contrary to the interest of

            justice to continue with the criminal

            proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal        proceeding         would

            tantamount to abuse of process of

            law      despite    settlement      and

            compromise between the victim and

            wrongdoer and whether to secure the

            ends of justice, it is appropriate that

            criminal case is put to an end and if

            the answer to the above question(s)

            is in affirmative, the High Court shall

            be well within its jurisdiction to quash

            the criminal proceeding."

      3. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014      -: 6 :-


offences alleged against the petitioner will not come

under the category of non-compoundable offences,

which are specifically excluded from composition, in

the exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C.   Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto

complainant, it is seen that the dispute between the

accused and the victim had been amicably settled

and, at present, the de facto complainant has no

subsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant

does not want to proceed with prosecution against the

accused.      Full and final settlement and compromise

with the victim are evidenced by Annexures-B and C.

In view of the compromise between the petitioner and

the victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is

remote, bleak and continuation of the criminal case

would, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice

and also tantamount to abuse of the process of the

court.    The present criminal prosecution against the

accused must be put to an end to secure the interest

of justice.

Crl.M.C. No. 7409 of 2014        -: 7 :-


      4. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against the petitioner         under Annexure-A        First

Information Report will stand quashed.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

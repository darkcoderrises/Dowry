                 Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 24th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.2066/2008 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kottarakkara which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.382/2008 of

Chadayamangalam Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., with a prayer to

quash    Annexure-1    FIR   and   2   final  report  in  Crime

No.382/2008 of Chadayamangalam Police Station and             all

further proceedings C.C.No.2066/2008 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Kottarakkara as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation raised by the defacto complainant

is that the first accused married her on 26/4/2004 and

thereafter lived together in the matrimonial home as husband

and wife. While so the accused Nos. 2 and 3 misappropriated

60 sovereigns of gold belongs to the defacto complainant with

the knowledge of the 1st accused. The first accused misused

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                               2

Rs.50,000/- given by the parents of the defacto complainant

and thereafter demanded further amount from her parents as

dowry, It is alleged that the accused Nos.2,3, and 4 subjected

the defacto complainant for mental and physical harassment

demanding more dowry. It is further alleged that on

27/4/20089 the accused Nos.2 to 4 put the defacto

complainant     under   confinement  demanding    money    and

thereby committed the above offences. Thus the accused has

committed the offences punishable under Section 498 A r/w

Section 34 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioners who are the

accused Nos. 1, 3, and 4 is that the matter is settled out of

Court and according to the petitioners as per settlement the

marriage is dissolved and the spouses are separated. The

second respondent, defacto complainant has sworn into

Annexure-3 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                               3

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 498A r/w Section 34 of

I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                                    4

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court,

in the decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and

Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD

817(SC)], has held as follows:-

                "7.  It is not in dispute that matrimonial

         disputes have been on considerable increase in

         recent times resulting in filing of complaints under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against

         the husband but also against the relatives of the

         husband. The question is when such matters are

         resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the

         matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

         pending    disputes  for  which    both   the  sides

         approached the High Court and jointly prayed for

         quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or

         complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406

         of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the

         sole ground that since the offences are non-

         compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

         would be impermissible for the court to quash the

         criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on

         hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                                    5

         complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,

         1961, with the help and intervention of family

         members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences

         and executed a compromise/settlement. Pursuant

         thereto, the appellants filed the said compromise

         before the Trial Court with a request to place the

         same    on   record  and    to  drop   the   criminal

         proceedings against the appellants herein.       It is

         also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual

         settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-

         wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she did

         not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of

         the settlement deed.     It is the grievance of the

         appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such

         prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed

         toe exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of

         the Code only on the ground that the criminal

         proceedings relate to the offences punishable under

         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-

         compoundable in nature."

               "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts

         to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial

         disputes, particularly, when the same are on

         considerable increase.    Even if the offences are

         non-compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial

         disputes and the Court is satisfied that the parties

         have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing

         ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not

         be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing of

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                                     6

         FIR,   complaint    or   the   subsequent     criminal

         proceedings.

                   13.    There has been an outburst of

         matrimonial    disputes   in  recent  times.      The

         institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society.

         Therefore, every effort should be made in the

         interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully.     If the

         parties ponder over their defaults and terminate

         their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order

         to do complete justice in the matrimonial matters,

         the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

         extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that

         the power under Section 482 should be exercised

         sparingly and with circumspection only when the

         Court is convinced, on the basis of material on

         record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or

         that   the   ends   of   justice  require  that    the

         proceedings ought to be quashed."

In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

Crl.M.C.No. 3061 of 2013
                                7

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed,      quashing

Annexure-1 FIR and 2 final report in Crime No.382/2008 of

Chadayamangalam Police Station and all further proceedings

C.C.No.2066/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

II, Kottarakkara except the petitioners.

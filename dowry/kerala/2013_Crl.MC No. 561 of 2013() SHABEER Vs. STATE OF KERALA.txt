                 ------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                 ------------------------------------
           Dated this the 16th day of August, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C.No.454 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.283 of 2010 of Kasaragod Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 and 452 read

with Section 34 of IPC of with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.454 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.    The prosecution allegation in the complaint is that

on 10/03/2010 at about 11.30 p.m. while the complainant was

sitting in the house the accused came in two motor bikes and

in an auto rickshaw and trespassed into the house and

Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                             :-2-:


attacked the de facto complainant and his mother. By that

time CW.3, who reached the place of occurrence was pushed

by the accused and he fallen and sustained injury and thus,

according to the prosecution, the accused have committed the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 and 452 read

with Section 34 of IPC. Now, according to the prosecution, the

entire dispute is settled with the de facto complainant, who is

the second respondent and other injured, who are respondents

3 and 4.       Thus, the de facto complainant/the second

respondent preferred Annexure-AV affidavit and respondents 3

and 4/the injured have sworn into Annexures-AV(a) and AV(b)

affidavits.

     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the respondents.     I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                             :-3-:


proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the respondents who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, who are the de facto

complainant and the injured do not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-AV, AV(a) and AV(b) affidavits. In the given facts

and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

     7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323 and 452

Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                                    :-4-:


read with Section 34 of IPC which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the respondents, it appears to me that the injured and the

de facto complainant have no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

Crl.M.C.No.561 of 2013
                             :-6-:


encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing     all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.454 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.

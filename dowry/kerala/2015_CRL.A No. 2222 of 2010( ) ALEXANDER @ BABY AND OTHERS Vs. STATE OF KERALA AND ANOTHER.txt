                     ------------------------------
                        Crl.A.No.2222 of 2010
                     -------------------------------
                     Dated 1st September, 2015

                             JUDGMENT

            This appeal has been preferred against the judgment of

conviction passed by the Court of Additional District and Sessions

Judge (Adhoc)II, Kollam in S.C.No.939 of 2008. The appellants were

respectively accused Nos.1 to 3 and 5 therein. In fact, though there

were five accused in S.C.No.939 of 2008 since the 4th accused was

absconding the case against him was split up and trial in S.C.No.939

of 2008 was proceeded only against the appellants. They were tried

for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 323,

324, 326, 427 and 308 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code and were found guilty, convicted and sentenced for the following

offences in the following manner:-

            For the conviction under Section 143, IPC the appellants

were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months

each and to pay a fine of  1,000/- each and in default of payment of

fine they were directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 15 days

each. For the conviction under Section 148, IPC they were sentenced

to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each and to pay a

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                 2


fine of  1,500/- each and in default of payment of fine to undergo

rigorous imprisonment for one month each. For the conviction under

Section 447, IPC they were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment

for one month each and to pay a fine of  500/- each and in default of

payment of fine to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 15 days each and

for the conviction under Section 326, IPC they were sentenced to

undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years each and to pay a fine of

 5,000/- each and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous

imprisonment for three months each.         No separate sentence was

awarded for the offences punishable under sections 147, 323 and 324,

IPC and they were acquitted of the offences punishable under Sections

427 and 308, IPC.       If the fine amount is realised an amount of

 15,000/- was directed to be given to PW1 and  5,000/- to PW2, as

compensation for the injuries sustained by them, under Section 357(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This appeal is preferred against the

said judgment of conviction.




             2. The case of the prosecution is that owing to previous

animosity towards PW1 due to the pendency of a civil litigation between

him and the first accused/the first appellant herein, with respect to

family properties, the appellants/accused in prosecution of their common

object to cause death of PW1 formed themselves into an unlawful

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                  3


assembly and criminally trespassed into his courtyard and committed

rioting, armed with deadly chopper, sticks etc. Going by the case of the

prosecution the accused inflicted injuries on the body of PWs 1 and 2

who are husband and wife. Ext.P2 is the wound certificate pertaining to

PW1 and Ext.P3 is the wound certificate relating to PW2. To bring home

the charge against the appellants prosecution had examined PWs 1 to 10

and got marked Exts.P1 to P12 besides identifying MO1 to MO6. After

the closure of the case of the prosecution the appellants were questioned

under Section 313, Cr.P.C. and they denied all the incriminating

circumstances put to them. Besides getting marked Exts.D1 to D4 which

are relevant portions of the statements recorded under Section 161,

Cr.P.C. of some of the witnesses they adduced no evidence in defence.

It is after appreciating the evidence on record that the learned Sessions

Judge passed the judgment of conviction and the sentence as aforesaid.

Evidently, this appeal has been preferred challenging the correctness of

the impugned judgment.




             3. During the pendency of this appeal the appellants filed an

application for impleading the injured viz., PWs 1 and 2 as parties to the

appeal stating that the parties have amicably settled the matter and a

compromise has already been entered into. Crl.M.A.No.3908 of 2015

has been filed in that regard. Notice was issued to PWs 1 and 2 who are

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                   4


sought to be impleaded and pursuant to the receipt of notice they

entered appearance through counsel.            Consequently, they were

impleaded as additional respondents 3 and 4 in this appeal.

Subsequently, additional respondents 3 and 4 filed affidavits endorsing

the contention of the appellants that the entire disputes have been

settled in between them and in such circumstances, the parties may be

permitted to compound the offence, in the interest of justice.




             4. It is evident from the affidavits filed respectively by

additional respondents 3 and 4 that they and the appellants are close

relatives and it would also reveal that the real genesis of the dispute that

ultimately culminated in the aforesaid unfortunate incident was civil

litigation relating family properties. From the facts thus disclosed from

the affidavits viz., Annexures.A1 and A2 and the submissions made by

the learned counsel on both sides the question to be considered is

whether in the interest of justice, the entire proceedings should be

terminated or not.       True that, the prayer of the appellants is for

compounding the offence. Evidently, except the offence under Section

326, IPC all the offences for which the appellants were convicted and

sentenced     are   compoundable.    When    Section   326,   IPC   is  not

compoundable even in a case where parties have amicably settled the

matters this Court cannot grant permission to compound the offence in

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                   5


terms of the provisions under Section 320, Cr.P.C.          Therefore, the

question is whether the case on hand is an eminently fit case for applying

the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab reported in 2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC). In the said

decision the Hon'ble Apex Court considered the relevant provisions of the

Code of Criminal Procedure as also various judgments of the Hon'ble

Apex Court and held as hereunder:-


              "The   position   that   emerges    from   the  above
        discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
        Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
        and different from the power given to a criminal court for
        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
        limitaion but it has to be exercised in accord with the
        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of
        any Court.    In what cases power to quash the criminal
        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
        depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and
        no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise
        of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the
        nature and gravity of the crime.       Heinous and serious
        offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
        dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
        victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
        dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
        serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
        between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
        under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or
        the offences committed by public servants while working in
        that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for
        quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences.
        But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                    6


        dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
        purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
        commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such
        like transactions or the offences ariging out matrimony
        relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the
        wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
        parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
        of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
        its view, because of the compromise between the offender
        and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
        and continuation of criminal case would put accused to
        great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
        would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case
        despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
        the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
        whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
        justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
        continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount
        to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
        compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
        whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
        criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the
        above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
        well   within  its   jurisdiction to   quash    the  criminal
        proceeding."




             5. A careful scanning of the decision in Gian Singh's case

(supra) would reveal that the power of High Court in exercise of inherent

jurisdiction under Section 482, Cr.P.C. and the power of a Criminal Court

under Section 320, Cr.P.C. are different and distinct and the former is

having wide plenitude.     The Hon'ble Apex Court held that the question

whether the power to quash criminal proceedings or complaint or FIR in

invocation of the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C. based on the

settlement of disputes between the offender and the victim would

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                   7


depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, it was

cautioned that, before exercising such power the High Court must have

due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape dacoity etc.

could not be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family

and the offender got settled the dispute. After having given a careful

consideration to the conclusions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in paragraph

57 of the decision in Gian Singh's case (supra) and also to the case on

hand I am of the view that the case on hand would not fall within the

category of cases which could not be interfered with in terms of the

observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court. In this case, as is evident from

Annexures. A1 and A2 and also the submissions made on behalf of both

the victims and the appellants they are very close relatives.         The

untoward incident occurred pursuant to the pendency of some civil

litigations among them. Now, they have settled the matters amicably and

compromised the civil litigations as also the case on hand. It is evident

from the situation now emerged that in order to maintain the friendliness

and kinship the parties wanted to give a quietus to the entire

proceedings and wanted to continue to live peacefully. The nature of the

offences, viewing in the aforesaid angle, can be said to be personal and

at any rate, in the light of the injuries sustained by PWs 1 and 2 and the

background upon which such untoward incident occurred I do not think it

Crl.A.No.2222/2010                     8


necessary to compel the parties to continue with the litigation. I am of

the view that, in the interest of justice, it will only be appropriate to

terminate the proceedings and in view of the situation presently emerged

continuation of criminal proceedings would amount to abuse of process

of court. Certainly, it will result in wasteful exercise, as well. In the light

of the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Gian Singh's case

(supra) and taking into account the circumstances expatiated above, I

am of the view that the continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of court as the alleged offences could not

be said to be very heinous so as to bring them under the class of

offences which are held as not fit for quashment.                In the said

circumstances, the judgment of the Court of Additional District and

Sessions Judge (Adhoc) II, Kollam in S.C.No.939 of 2008 and the F.I.R in

Crime No.143 of 2007 of Yerroor Police Station and all consequential

proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed.

             This appeal is allowed as above.

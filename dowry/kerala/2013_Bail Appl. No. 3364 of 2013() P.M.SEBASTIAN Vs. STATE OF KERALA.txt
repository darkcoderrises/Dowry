                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
             Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013.

                                  ORDER



          Petitioners are the in-laws of the unfortunate

victim, who committed suicide on 28.3.2013.                      The

petitioners would say that they have not committed any act

which would constitute an offence and the entire allegations

are against the first accused, who is their son. It is pointed

out that they had in fact made all efforts to bring back the

victim to the matrimonial house and provide her a peaceful

life. They never made any demand for dowry and they have

not done anything to the victim to drive her to commit

suicide. It is pointed out that even going through the FIR it

could be seen that most of the allegations are against the

first accused, the son of the petitioners and there are only

vague and general allegations as against the petitioners are

concerned. It is therefore prayed that they may be granted

pre-arrest bail.

B.A.3364/2013.
                              2

            2.  Learned Additional Director General of

Prosecution very vehemently opposed the petition and

pointed out that the petitioners are not as innocent as they

pretend to be. It is pointed out by the Addl.D.G.P. that the

death was within three years of marriage and the materials

on record would show that she was treated cruelly both

mentally and physically by the petitioners as well as their

son. In fact, the Addl.D.G.P. brought to the notice of this

court the order of the court below wherein the court below

found that in the light of the materials available, it will not

be appropriate to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

Learned Addl.D.G.P. prays that considering the nature of the

allegations against the petitioners and also the fact that

investigation is at an infant stage, this court may not

exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction in favour of the

petitioners.

            3. After having heard learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and having

B.A.3364/2013.
                                3

perused the records, it is felt that there is considerable force

in the submission of the learned Addl.D.G.P. A perusal of the

order of the court below produced along with the petition

clearly shows that the petitioners are not as innocent as

they claim to be.      In fact one incident has been made

mention of wherein the victim informed her parents that hot

water      has been poured on her by her month-in-law.

Learned Addl.D.G.P. referred to the post-mortem report and

pointed out that this allegation is probabilised by the injury

noticed by the doctor who conducted post-mortem. It is also

pointed out that there are several other instances which

would show that the petitioners have been cruel to the

victim.

            4. As of now, the claim of the learned counsel for

the petitioners that the allegations against the petitioners

are of vague nature cannot be countenanced. A probe into

the veracity of the allegations at this point of time is not

warranted.     Suffice to say, considering the nature of the

B.A.3364/2013.
                                 4

allegations, the manner in which the incident had occurred,

the fact that death was within three years of marriage, also

the fact that there are indications of ill-treatment and also

considering the fact that investigation is only progressing, it

is felt that it may not be proper to grant anticipatory bail to

the petitioners.

            This application is accordingly dismissed.

                      Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 26th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by the accused

persons in C.C.No.217/2013 (Crime No.219/2009 of Kasaragod

police station) pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod on the basis of a settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that a crime was registered

as Crime No.219/2009 of Kasaragod police station against

the petitioners on the basis of a statement given by the first

respondent as      defacto complainant alleging offences under

Sections 143, 147, 341, 323 and 153 A read with Section 149

of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, Annexure-A1

final report was filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod and the case was                               taken on file as

C.C.No.217/2013       and that is pending before that court.                   In

the meantime, the matter has been settled between the parties

and cordial relationship has been restored between the defacto

complainant and the petitioners,                 who        belong to   different

Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014                    2

community. Since some of the offences are non compoundable

in nature, they could not file application before the court below

for compounding. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served as well in continuing with the prosecution as it will

amount to wastage of judicial time. So, the petitioners have no

other remedy except to approach this                      Court Seeking the

following reliefs:

                    i. Call for the records in C.C.No.217/2013 on the

            file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod

            and to quash Annexure A1 Final Report.

                    ii. And may also be pleased to pass any other

            order or        direction deem fit and proper to the

            circumstances of this case and thus render justice.

        3. The first respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he has no grievance against the petitioners and now their

relationship has been restored on account of the settlement

which was effected due to intervention of members of both the

community and harmony has been restored in the locality on

account of the settlement.               The counsel also submitted that

the first respondent filed Annexure A3 affidavit stating these

Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014             3

facts. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of

the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction. So prayed

for allowing the application.

        4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court submitted that except this case there is

no other case against the petitioners. But          considering the

nature of          allegations and offences alleged,    opposed the

application for quashing the proceedings.

        5. Heard both sides.

        6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the first respondent,      Kasaragod police has registered

a case as Crime No.219/2009 of Kasaragod police station

against the petitioners alleging offences under sections 143,

147, 341, 323 and 153 A read with Section 149 of the Indian

Penal Code and after investigation Annexure A1 final report

has     been       filed   and  the case  was  taken    on   file as

C.C.No.217/2013 and the same is pending before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod. It is seen from the

allegations and the averments         made by the counsel for the

petitioners and the first respondent that the matter has been

settled between the parties due to intervention of members of

Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014                  4

both the community and on account of the settlement, harmony

has been restored among the members of the two community

in the locality. It is true that            Section 153 A is a grave

offence. But when           a matter has been           settled between the

parties and on account of the settlement, if harmony has been

restored between the two communities and peace has been

brought in the locality, then such settlement has to be promoted

by the court and pendency of the case should not be a hurdle

for the same.          Further, in view of the settlement neither the

defacto complainant nor the witnesses is likely to support the

case of the prosecution and               conviction in such case will be

remote as well. Allowing the prosecution                   to continue only

amount to wastage of judicial time as well.

        7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014                   5

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite  full and   complete    settlement  and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




        8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C.No.2319 of 2014             6

between the parties and in view of the settlement, possibility of

conviction is remote even if the trial of the case is allowed to

proceed with and the relationship has been restored between

parties on account of the settlement, this Court feels that this

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

to promote the settlement and the harmony that has been

restored between the parties and peace has to be established in

the locality.


        9. So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.No.217/13 (Crime No.219/2009 of Kasaragod police

station) pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod as against the petitioners is quashed.

        Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

                  ===========================
                        Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                 ============================
                Dated this the 26th day of August, 2014

                                 ORDER


      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners,

who are accused in C.C.No.1222/2010 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, I, Ernakulam, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No.121/2010 of Mulavukadu Police Station for

the offences punishable under Sections 324, 323, 448 and 2949b) r/w

Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 final charge

filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate - I, Ernakulam as the

matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that the petitioners are

in inimical terms with the respondents 2 and 3 in connection with a

police complaint filed by the party respondents against one of the

Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                                       2



friends of the petitioners. It is alleged that the petitioners assaulted 2nd

and 3rd respondents and they suffered injuries and thus, the accused

have committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

2nd and 3rd respondents.        I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case.      Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, who on

the basis of specific instruction received          from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondents, who are the victims does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no

Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                                      3



grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.            In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

under Sections 324, 323, 448 and 294(b) r/w Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code, which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to me that the

victims have no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                                      4



light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57.  The position that emerges from the
          above discussion can be summarised thus:             the
          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
          the    power    given  to  a    criminal     court   for
          compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
          statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
          accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
          viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
          abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
          power to quash the criminal proceeding or
          complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
          offender and victim have settled their dispute
          would depend on the facts and circumstances of
          each case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          ".........   But   the   criminal     cases      having
          overwhelmingly       and    pre-dominatingly       civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
          of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                                     5



          commercial,        financial,mercantile,      civil,
          partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
          is basically private or personal in nature and the
          parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the
          compromise between the offender and victim, the
          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
          continuation of criminal case would put accused
          to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
          the criminal case despite       full and complete
          settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in

the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not

Crl.M.C No.4868 of 2014
                                     6



have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer wastage of judicial time and abuse

of process of the court and proceedings.      Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -A1

final charge and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners

in C.C.No.1222/2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I,

Ernakulam in Crime No.121/2010 of Mulavukadu Police Station.

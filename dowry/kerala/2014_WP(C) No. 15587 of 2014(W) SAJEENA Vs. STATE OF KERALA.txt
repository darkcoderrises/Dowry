Ramachandra Menon,J



      Petitioner is before this Court alleging high handed action

on the part of the respondents 4 and 5, physically manhandling

petitioner and her minor children and thus seeks for a direction

to be given to the respondents 1 to 3 to provide adequate and

effective protection to the life of the petitioner and her children.

      2. The 4th respondent is the husband of the petitioner and

the   5th respondent is her father in law.         The case of the

petitioner is that, there was frequent quarrel by the respondents

4 and 5 demanding dowry from the petitioner which could not be

acceded to, as a result of which the petitioner and children were

brutally manhandled by respondents 4 and 5.            The offences

committed by the concerned respondents were brought to the

notice of the police then and there; but not effective action was

W.P.(C) No.15587 of 2014
                                 2



taken by the police. Reliance is sought to be placed on Exts.P1

to P4 wound certificates as to the ordeal which had to be faced

by the petitioner and her brother. The Police is simply dancing

to the tune of respondents 4 and 5 who are yielding much

influence over them and hence the writ petition seeking for

immediate interference.

     3. The learned State Attorney submits on instructions that,

the allegations raised against the Police are not at all correct.

Immediately on obtaining the complaint, the matter was

enquired into and a crime was registered against the accused. In

furtherance to the subsequent complaint, yet another crime was

registered as Crime No.2088 of 2014 under various offences

before the Karunagappally police station and investigation is

going on. It is stated that earnest efforts are being taken by the

Police to complete the investigations and submit the charge

sheet. It is also stated that the petitioner is residing in the very

same address as of the respondents 4 and 5 and that there is no

threat to the law and order situation.

     Recording the submissions made by the learned State

Attorney, the matter is disposed of, making it clear that, the

W.P.(C) No.15587 of 2014
                                 3



investigation of the concerned crimes shall be completed and

appropriate steps shall be taken in accordance with law, if there

is any threat to the law and order situation. No other directions

are called for and the matter is closed accordingly.



                                            MANJULA CHELLUR,
                                                CHIEF JUSTICE




                                   P.R.RAMACHANDRA MENON,
                                                         JUDGE.

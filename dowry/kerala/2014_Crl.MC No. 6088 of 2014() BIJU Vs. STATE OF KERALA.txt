                  ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
           =========================
                  Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014
         ============================
          Dated this the 28th day of October, 2014

                           ORDER



     The above Criminal Miscellaneous Case (Crl.M.C.) seeking

the invocation of the inherent powers conferred on this Court

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been

filed with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure A final

report/charge sheet in Crime No.855 of 2011 of Chavara

Thekkumbhagom Police Station which has led to the pendency of

the Calendar Case C.C No.195 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamkotta and all further

proceedings arising therefrom.     The petitioners are the nine

accused    (A1 to A9) in Crime No.855 of 2011 of Chavara

Thekkumbhagom Police Station alleging offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 341, 323, 324, 326, 427 and

354 r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.

     2. The gist of the prosecution case is that on 23.10.2011 at

1:15 p.m the petitioners/accused assembled together unlawfully

and petitioners 1 to 3 entered into the hall of the 2nd respondent's

house and the 1st petitioner attacked the 2nd respondent with an

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014           2



iron ring on his nose causing injury, the 4th petitioner attacked

the 3rd respondent with a hammer causing pain on his shoulder,

petitioners 5 and 6 assaulted the 3rd respondent with hands

causing pain, thereafter petitioners 7 to 9 caught hold of the hair

of the respondent Nos.4 and 5 thereby outraged their modesty.

It is further alleged that a gold chain worth Rs.75,000/- of the 5th

respondent was also lost in the said incident and thereby the

petitioners/accused have committed the above said offences.

Crime No.855 of 2011 was registered on the basis of the above

allegations wherein the petitioners have been arrayed as

accused.     After investigation, the police has submitted the

impugned Annexure A final report/charge sheet in the

aforementioned crime and the matter is now pending as C.C

No.195 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Sasthamkotta.        The 2nd respondent is the de facto

complainant/injured and respondents 3 to 5 are also the injured

in this case.       The petitioners and respondents 2 to 5 had

discussed the matter and settled the disputes and they are now

in good terms, it is stated. That respondents 2 to 5 have no

interest to continue the impugned criminal proceedings against

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014          3



the petitioners and that respondents have no objection to quash

the proceedings against the petitioners. Respondents 2 to 5 have

filed separate affidavits stating these aspects as per Annexures

B, C, D and E respectively. In those affidavits, it is stated by the

contesting respondents that the disputes between the parties

have been amicably settled and that they have no interest to

continue the impugned criminal proceedings against the

petitioners and that they have no objection to quash the

impugned criminal proceedings against the petitioners in Crime

No.855 of 2011 of Chavara Thekkumbhagom Police Station

which is now pending as C.C No.195 of 2012 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamkotta. It is in the

background of these facts and circumstances                that the

aforementioned Crl.M.C has been filed.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.K.V.Anil

Kumar has taken notice for respondents 2 to 5 and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State of

Kerala.

      4.    Heard Sri.P.V.Dileep, the learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners, Sri.K.V.Anil Kumar, learned counsel

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014          4



appearing for respondents 2 to 5 and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Kearla.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.K.V.Anil Kumar, the learned counsel appearing for

respondents 2 to 5 has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by respondents 2 to 5 that they have

amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and that they

have no objection in the quashment of the impugned criminal

proceedings and that the complainants/victims/injured does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as they

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014          5



have no grievance against them and that they will not raise any

dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and

not much element of public interest is involved. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for respondents 2 to 5, it is clear to the

court that the injured/victims/de facto complainants have no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of

the settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014                 6



relevant to note the decision of the Apex Court in the case

between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1)

SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108

(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                  "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.        In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
         facts and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
          offences          arising       from        commercial,
          financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
          the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
          criminal case would put accused to great oppression
          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014              7



         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with the
         victim........"

      In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014

(8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426

(SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

            "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
      entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
      peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
      proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace
      and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
      them".

      The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014          8



of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure A final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime

No.855 of 2011 of Chavara Thekkumbhagom Police Station

which has led to the pendency of C.C No.195 of 2012 on the file

of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamkotta and all

Crl.M.C No.6088 of 2014          9



further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed.           The

petitioners shall produce certified copies of this order before the

court below concerned as well as before the Station House

Officer, Chavara Thekkumbhagom Police Station.

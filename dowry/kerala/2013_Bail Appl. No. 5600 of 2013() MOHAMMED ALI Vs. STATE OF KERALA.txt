                    THOMAS P.JOSEPH, J.
            ====================================
                     B.A. No.5600 of 2013
            ====================================
            Dated this the 03rd day of October,    2013

                            O R D E R

      Petitioner is the accused,     in Crime No.480 of       2013 of

Shornur Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 498A

and 506(i) read with Sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code and Secs.3

and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

      2.    Petitioner married the de facto complainant on

31.03.2013. According to the petitioner, they lived together only

for four days. Learned counsel submits that the allegations against

the petitioner are false.

      3.    Learned counsel for     the de facto complainant       has

brought to my attention various messages sent by the petitioner to

the de facto complainant through the mobile phone.

      4.    I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor also.

      5.    Having regard to the circumstances of the case I am

inclined to think that custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not

required.   Hence I am inclined to grant relief to the petitioner.

      Resultantly this application is allowed   as under:

      (i)   It is directed that in case the petitioner is arrested in

B.A. No.5600 of 2013
                                      -: 2 :-


Crime No.480 of 2013 of Shornur              Police Station he shall be

released on bail on his         executing bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees

Fifteen thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each

before the arresting officer and subject to the following conditions.

        (a)      Petitioner shall report to the officer investigating the

case on every Monday and Saturday between 10.00 a.m. and

12.00 noon and on other dates as may be directed by that officer

for a period of one month from 17.10.2013 or till final report is

filed, whichever is earlier.

        (b)      In case presence of petitioner is required for

interrogation       on any other day, the investigating officer shall

issue notice to the petitioner as provided in Sec.160 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.




                                       THOMAS P.JOSEPH, JUDGE.

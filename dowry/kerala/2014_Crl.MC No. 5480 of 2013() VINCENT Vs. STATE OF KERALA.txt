                       Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013
                    ..................................................
               Dated this the 6th day of March, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


       This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No.2045/13 of Kundara police

station to quash the proceedings under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.

       2. It is alleged in the petition that                    a crime    has been

registered on      the basis of a statement given by the second

respondent/defacto complainant against the petitioners alleging

the offences under Sections 294 (b), 324 and 308 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The                            matter has been

settled    between the parties as                   they are neighbours and

respectable persons of the locality have intervened for

settlement of the issue. Now harmony has been restored

between them.      Further, the incident itself happened                      due to

ill effect of alcoholic consumption. No purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case. Since non compounding offences

have been incorporated, the police will not drop the proceedings.

So they have no other option but to                         approach      this court

Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013                 2

seeking the following reliefs:

          1. Quash   the proceedings pending against the petitioners
          as in Crime No.2045/2013 of Kundara Police Station.

          2. Grant such other relief deemed fit to this Hon'ble Court.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that due to intervention of mediators, the matter

has been settled and the dispute arose between them due to

consumption of alcohol. So no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the investigation in the case.

      4. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case.

      5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,                 as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

between the petitioners or the defacto complainant and they

are neighbours and it is understood from the investigating

officer that the matter has been settled due to intervention of

panchayat President and others of the locality. But, however,

considering the nature of the            offence       alleged, opposed the

application for quashing the case at this stage.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent, Kundara police has registered

Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013          3

a case as Crime No.2045/13 against the petitioners evidenced

by Annexure A alleging       the offences under Sections 294 (b),

324, and 308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Investigation is in the primitive stage. It is at this stage that

the matter has been settled between the parties due to

intervention of local panchayat President and other well wishers

and friends of the parties. It is also seen from the wound

certificate regarding the cause of injury as "       

              ". It is also

mentioned in the wound certificate that there is alcoholic

presence in the defacto complainant and the injured as well. So

it is clear from this that the incident occurred at the time when

both were consumed alcohol and it is an after effect of

consumption of alcohol by       both the injured and the accused

persons in this case. Normally this Court will not be inclined to

quash the proceedings involving grave offences at the primitive

stage of investigation itself. But in this case, it is seen that the

petitioners and the defacto complainant were neighbours and

the incident itself happened as an ill effect of consumption of

alcohol by the both the parties. They have now realised the ill

effect and the matter itself is settled due to intervention of

Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013                 4

respectable      persons of the locality including             the panchayat

President.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

           "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
           arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
           partnership or such like transactions or the offences
           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
           quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
           compromise between the offender and victim, the
           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
           continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
           oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
           caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the
           victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
           whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
           justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
           continuation   of   the    criminal   proceedings    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
           and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
           whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
           that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to
           the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
           shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
           proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to intervention of respectable persons

of the locality including the panchayt President and the incident

Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013           5

itself happened as an ill effect of alcohol consumption and since

the matter has been settled, no purpose will be served in

continuing with the investigation in the case as they are not

going to support the case of the prosecution and if ultimately

final report is filed and the case is allowed to proceed with, that

will amount to wastage of judicial time also. Further it is seen

from the affidavit filed by the second respondent that harmony

has been restored on account of the settlement between the

neighbours         namely    petitioners    and     the     second

respondent/defacto       complainant.     So     considering   the

circumstances, this Court feels that it is a fit case where power

under Section 482 can be invoked to quash the proceedings as

an exceptional case to promote harmony that has been restored

between the neighbours on account of the settlement which

was effected due to intervention of respectable persons like

panchayat President etc. So this petition is allowed and further

proceeding      in Crime No.2045/13 of Kundara police station

against the petitioners is quashed.



      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court to be informed to the concerned police station

Crl.M.C.No.5480 of 2013             6

for necessary further action in this regard.

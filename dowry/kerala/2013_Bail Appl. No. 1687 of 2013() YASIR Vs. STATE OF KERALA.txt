                   B.A.NO.1687 Of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 19th day of March, 2013

                             ORDER


      Petitioners are accused in crime No.10/2013 of Peringom

Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under

Sections 420 of the Indian Penal Code. A crime was registered on

a complainant which was filed before a Magistrate and referred to

police. Complainant alleged that the 1st among the petitioners

promised to marry his daughter and pursuant there to a marriage

engagement ceremony was conducted, in which 2nd and 3rd

petitioners who are uncles of 1st petitioner also attended. Later

all of them withdrew from the promise made, when their unlawful

demand for dowry was not accepted, and thereby he suffered

loss of Rs.1,00,000/- was his case.      Petitioners apprehending

their arrest have filed the above petition seeking pre-arrest bail.

      2.    I heard the counsel for petitioners and also learned

public prosecutor. From the submissions made and also

circumstances presented prima facie, it appears, that the breach

of promise to marry the daughter of complainant would give rise

B.A.NO.1687 Of 2013               2




to a claim for damages only, and not an offence of cheating.

However, I am not expressing any final opinion. The observation

made above shall not be treated as conclusive in the

investigation of the crime. In the given facts of the case,

petitioners are entitled to seek for pre-arrest bail. So much so, it

is ordered that in the event of arrest of the petitioners or any of

them by police, in connection with the above crime, they shall be

released on executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten

thousand only) each.       Petitioners shall co-operate with the

investigation of the crime.

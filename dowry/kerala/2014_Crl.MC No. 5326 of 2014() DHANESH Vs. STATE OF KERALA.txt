                      Crl.M.C.No. 5326 of 2014
           Dated----------------------------2014
                    this the 22nd day of September,

                                 O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioner, who is

the accused in C.C. No. 961 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial Fist Class

Magistrate - I, Ernakulam which is a case instituted upon the police report

in Crime No. 215 of 2013 of Mulavukadu Police Station for offences

punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 427 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure 1 and 2, FIR and charge sheet in the aforesaid crime, as

the matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that when the de facto

complainant was talking with her husband's fried one Mr. Boban, the

accused who is a family friend of her, slapped on her face and caught

hold of her hand and destroyed her mobile phone worth Rs. 3500/-,        and

Crl.M.C.No. 5326 of 2014


                                    :-2-:

now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner          as well as

respondents 2 and 3. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime/case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for respondents 2 and 3 who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the 2nd respondent/de facto complainant,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant//injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioner and she has no

grievance against the petitioner.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, and especially,

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

Crl.M.C.No. 5326 of 2014


                                             :-3-:

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

           7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only 323, 354

and 427 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-

          "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised
         thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to
         be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure
         the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised
         where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No. 5326 of 2014


                                             :-4-:

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
           flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
           offences arising from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such
           like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or
           the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
           the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
           and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
           prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
           victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly, in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.                   Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

                                       :-5-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure - 1 and 2,

the FIR and Charge Sheet in Crime No. 215 of 2013 of Mulavukad Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto pending against the petitioner in

C.C.No. 691/2013 pending before the Judicial First       Class Magistrate - I,

Ernakulam.

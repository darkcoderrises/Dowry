           ................................................................
                   CRL. M.C. No.7001 of 2014
            ...............................................................
              Dated this the 18th day of March, 2015

                                   O R D E R


      Petitioners are A1 to A5 in Crime No.41/13 of the

Pariyaram       Medical         College          Police        Station,     Kannur

registered for the offence punishable under Section 498A

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure AIII Final Report in

Crime No.41.2013 of the Pariyaram Medical College Police

Station, Kannur, and all further proceedings against the

petitioners pursuant to the same in C.C.No.875/13 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Payyannur, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.7001 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The      defacto complainant,  who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.7001 of 2014
                                -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure AIII

Final Report in Crime No.41.2013 of the Pariyaram Medical

College Police Station, Kannur and all further proceedings

against     the    petitioners  pursuant   to   the same    in

C.C.No.875/13 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Payyannur, are hereby quashed.

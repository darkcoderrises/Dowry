                  B.A. NO.3631 of 2012
          ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 11th day of June, 2012

                            ORDER


            This is an application for bail filed under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            2. Petitioners     are the accused in Crime

No.296/2012 of Kottiyam Police Station, registered on a

complaint filed by the wife of the first petitioner before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kollam, which was forwarded

to the Station House Officer for investigation and report

under Section 156(3) of the Code.        Investigation of the

crime is now in progress. Petitioners are proceeded with

for the offences under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code and Section 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Marriage

between the first petitioner and the complainant was in

2001 and they have two children out of their matrimonial

relationship. First petitioner was employed in a Gulf country

B.A. NO.3631 of 2012             2



and it is stated he returned only a few months back.

Second and third petitioners are the sisters of the first

petitioner, husband, who, according to the counsel for the

petitioners, are living with their family at far off places.

De facto complainant has filed a complaint on false

allegations to vex and harass the petitioners, is the

submission of the counsel. Learned Public Prosecutor, after

getting instructions, submits that the investigation is now

proceeded only against the first petitioner as the materials

so far collected have disclosed that further proceedings

against second and third petitioners, his sisters, are not

warranted and, therefore, they are deleted from the array of

the accused. Learned Public Prosecutor has handed over me

the Case Diary for perusal. Going through the complaint,

and also other materials gathered during the investigation

of the crime, I find custodial interrogation of the first

petitioner after his arrest as such is not required for a fair

investigation of the crime. Complaint filed by the wife of

B.A. NO.3631 of 2012             3



the first petitioner does not spell out any callous or cruel ill

treatment by him, but, he had sent over the de facto

complainant to her house three years back and thereafter

failure on his part to maintain them.        True there are

allegations as to vexing and harassing the complainant with

demand for dowry. Any how that is a matter that requires to

be investigated in the case.

           3. In the case of second and third petitioners no

order is warranted as it is reported they have been deleted

from the array of the accused and the investigation is

proceeding only against the first petitioner as the sole

accused. In the event of arrest of the first petitioner in

connection with the crime the investigating officer shall

release him on bail on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/-

(Rupees Ten Thousand Only), with one solvent surety for

the sum with direction to seek regular bail from the

competent court. The direction as above shall remain in

force for a period of one month from today, and the

B.A. NO.3631 of 2012             4



petitioner has to move for seeking regular bail within such

time from the Magistrate.

           Petition is disposed of.

                Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013
                  -------------------------------
        Dated this the 11th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused nos.4 and 5 in

C.C.No.1604 of 2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-1, Thrissur, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No. 1058 of 2011 of Town East

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Sections

406, 498 (A), 420, 325, 447 and 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure-A FIR in the above crime and Annexure-

B Charge sheet in the above calendar case and all further

proceedings pending thereto against the petitioners, as the

matter is settled out of court.

       2. The allegation in the above case is that on

23.2.2003, the 1st accused, who is the brother of the 1st

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                              2

petitioner herein, married the de facto complainant in

accordance with Christian rites and ceremonies and

thereafter, harassed the de facto complainant both

mentally and physically demanding more dowry and the

money and the gold given at the time of marriage, were

misappropriated by the accused, including the petitioners

herein, and committed the offences punishable under

Sections 406, 498 (A), 420, 325, 447 and 149 of I.P.C.

Now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled

out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                3

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance

against them.

         6.       I   have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 406,

498 (A), 420, 325, 447 and 149 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                   4

It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decisions of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)]        and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817

(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
         court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code.     Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
         with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
         criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have settled

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                    5

         their     dispute would    depend    on  the   facts  and
         circumstances of each case and no category can be
         prescribed."




It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
         and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
         footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc.
         or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
         private or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases,
         High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
         view, because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
         criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

Further, in        Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case,            the Apex

Court has held as follows:-

                 "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes
         have been on considerable increase in recent times
         resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A and
         406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also
         against the relatives of the husband.     The question is
         when such matters are resolved either by the wife
         agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual
         settlement of other pending disputes for which both the
         sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for
         quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or
         complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406 of
         I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the sole

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                   6

         ground that since the offences are non-compoundable
         under Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible
         for the court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or
         complaint.
                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand
         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under
         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of
         the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and
         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers,
         the parties concerned have amicably settled their
         differences and executed a compromise/settlement.
         Pursuant      thereto, the  appellants    filed the   said
         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to
         place the same on record and to drop the criminal
         proceedings against the appellants herein. It is also not
         in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement
         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed
         an affidavit stating that she did not wish to pursue the
         criminal proceedings against the appellants and fully
         supported the contents of the settlement deed. It is the
         grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court
         rejected such prayer of the parties but also the High
         Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction under Section
         482 of the Code only on the ground that the criminal
         proceedings relate to the offences punishable under
         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
         compoundable in nature."
                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to
         encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,
         particularly, when the same are on considerable
         increase. Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if
         they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably
         and without any pressure, we hold that for the purpose
         of securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code
         would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
         of   FIR,     complaint  or  the    subsequent    criminal
         proceedings.
                13.   There has been an outburst of matrimonial
         disputes in recent times.    The institution of marriage
         occupies an important place and it has an important role
         to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be
         made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                   7

         them to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the
         parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their
         disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
         fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete
         justice in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be
         less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction.
         It is trite to state that the power under Section 482
         should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection
         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of
         material on record, that allowing the proceedings to
         continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court
         or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings
         ought to be quashed."

Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings

are initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose

among the parties and both the disputes are now amicably

settled between the parties. According to me, in the light

of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be

squarely applicable in the present case. According to me,

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.

It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

Crl.M.C.No.1914 of 2013

                                8

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution, resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste

of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A FIR in Crime No. 1058 of 2011 of Town East

Police     Station     and   Annexure-B  Charge    sheet   in

C.C.No.1604 of 2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-1, Thrissur and all further proceedings pending

thereto against the petitioners.

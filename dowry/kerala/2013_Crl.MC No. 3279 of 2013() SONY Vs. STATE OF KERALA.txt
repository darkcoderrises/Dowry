                 -----------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                 -----------------------------------
          Dated this the 05th day of August, 2013

                             ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime

No.461 of 2013 of Upputhara Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 395, 323, 341 & 294(b) of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-I F.I.R. in Crime No.461 of

2013 of Upputhara Police Station and all further proceedings

pursuant to the same, as the matter is settled out of court.

     2. The allegation in the above case is that on 21/7/2013

at about 8.15 p.m., all the accused intercepted goods auto

rickshaw bearing registration No.K.37B-1752 driven by the

de facto complainant and conjointly committed robbery of an

amount of `20,000/- and the autorickshaw, after causing

injuries to him and another who was travelling along with

him. The 2nd respondent herein is the de facto complainant.

The 3rd respondent herein is the other injured person. Thus,

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                            :-2-:


according to the prosecution, the petitioners, who are

accused Nos.1 to 6 have committed the offences punishable

under Sections 395, 323, 341 & 294(b) of I.P.C.     Now, the

case of the petitioners is that during the pendency of the

crime, the matter is settled between the petitioners and the

second respondent, who is the de facto complainant and 3rd

respondent, who is the injured on the ground that there

were frequent business transactions among the accused,

the second respondent/ the de facto complainant and the 3rd

respondent/injured.    Accordingly, the second respondent,

who     is   the    de  facto    complainant  and   the   3rd

respondent/injured have respectively sworn into Annexures-

III and IV affidavits.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners    as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents.    I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                            :-3-:


settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above crime.      Therefore, the continuation of

the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of

law and proceedings.

     5.   The    learned  counsel   for   the   2nd   and    3rd

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the

injured do not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents

and materials produced along with the above petition

including Annexures-III and IV affidavits. In the given facts

and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                                :-4-:


     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 395,

323, 341 & 294(b) of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to me

that the injured and the de facto complainant have no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.  The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:  the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                                    :-5-:


          or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

         distinct and different from the power given to a criminal

         court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord

         with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

         process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

         criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

         exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

         dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of

         each case and no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly

         and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

         footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

         offences           arising       from         commercial,

         financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

         transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

         relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

         wrong is basically private or personal in nature and

         the parties have resolved their entire dispute.   In this

         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

         proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

         between the offender and victim, the possibility of

         conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

         criminal case would put accused to great oppression

         and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                                  :-6-:


        to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

        complete       settlement and  compromise     with    the

        victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.3279 of 2013
                             :-7-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I F.I.R. in Crime No.461 of 2013 of Upputhara Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

        As the entire criminal case pending against the

petitioners, who are the accused, is quashed, the Registry is

directed to forward this order to the Superintendent of Sub

Jail, Peermade.

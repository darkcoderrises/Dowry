                  CRL. M.C. No.6983 of 2014
           ...............................................................
           Dated this the 16th day of February, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioner is first accused in Crime No.171/2012 of the

Mankada Police Station, Malappuram registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A, 406 and 506(ii)

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A First Information

Report in Crime No.171/2012 of the Mankada Police Station

and Annexure-B Final Report, and all further proceedings

based on it, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

along with the other accused, have tortured and harassed

the defacto complainant, who is his wife, and treated her

CRL.M.C.No.6983 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by

demanding more dowry, after misappropriating her entire

gold ornaments and money.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,    who   is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

CRL.M.C.No.6983 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A

First Information Report in Crime No.171/2012 of the

Mankada Police Station and Annexure-B Final Report, and

all further proceedings based on it, are hereby quashed.

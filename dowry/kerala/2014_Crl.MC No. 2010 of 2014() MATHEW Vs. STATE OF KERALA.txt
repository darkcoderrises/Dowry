    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 08th day of April, 2014.


                           O R D E R




     This is an application filed by accused Nos.1 to 4 in

S.C.No.420/11     pending     before   the    Sessions   Court,

Pathanamthitta,    to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 to 4 in S.C.No.420/11 on the file of the

Sessions Court, Pathanamthitta which originated on the basis

of Crime No.201/09 of Vechuchira Police Station registered on

the basis of a statement given by the de facto complainant

who is shown as second respondent herein alleging offences

under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(ii), 308, read with Section 34

of Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed

and thereafter, it was committed to the Court of Sessions and

now pending as S.C.No.420/11 before the Sessions Court,

Pathanamthitta. In the meantime, the matter has been settled

between the parties. They are neighbours and on account of

the settlement, their relationship has been restored. According

Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014       : 2 :

to the petitioner, in view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case.             Since some of the

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

compound the case before the court below. So, they have no

other remedy except to approach this court seeking the

following relief:

            "To call for the records relating to Annexure A2

     charge in SC.No.420/2011 pending before the Sessions

     Court Pathanamthitta initiated against the petitioners in

     Crime No.201/09 of Vechuchira Police station and to

     quash the charge and all further proceedings in SC

     No.420/2011      pending  before   the    Sessions Court,

     Pathanamthitta in the interest of justice."

      3.     The second respondent appeared through Counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between the

parties on account of the intervention of mediators and friends

and their relationship has been restored and they are

nieghbours and in view of the settlement, they do not want to

prosecute the case. They have also filed affidavit stating these

facts. The Counsel for the petitioners submitted that, in view

of the settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction and

so he prayed for allowing the application.

      4.     On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor on

Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014       :  3 :

instructions, as directed by this court submitted that, there is

no other case against the petitioner and they have no criminal

background but opposed the application on the ground that

Section 308 of Indian Penal Code has been incorporated.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioners are the

accused in S.C.No.420/11 of Sessions Court, Pathanamthitta.

Crime No.201/09 was registered on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent against the petitioners alleging

offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(ii), 308 read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and after investigation, final

report was filed before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Ranny and that court has committed the case to the Court of

Sessions and after committal, it was taken on file as

S.C.No.420/11 and it is pending before Sessions Court,

Pathanamthitta. The matter has been now settled between the

parties. Though Section 308 of Indian Penal Code has been

incorporated, there is no injury caused to the de facto

complainant. However, it is stated in the affidavit that they

are neighbours and the matter has been settled due to the

intervention of       local people, friends and relatives and on

account of the settlement, their original relationship has been

Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014        :  4 :

restored. In view of the settlement, even if the case is allowed

to proceed, no purpose will be served as they will not support

the case of the prosecution and possibility of conviction will be

remote and the exercise will only be a wastage of judicial time

as well.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings

Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014         :  5 :

      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision also      and considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and no public interest is

involved and as it is not a case of offence affecting the

society at large and in view of the settlement, the original

relationship has been restored between the parties             and no

purpose      will be     served by proceeding with the case as

conviction will be remote and it will be wastage of judicial

Crl.M.C.No.2010 of 2014       :  6 :

time, this Court feels that it is a fit case where power under

Section 482       of the  Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to      quash the proceedings in order to promote the

settlement      and    restoration of relationship  between the

parties and the pendency of this case will not be a hurdle for

the same.

      8.     So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in S.C.No.420/11 (Crime No.201/09 of Vechuchira police

station) pending before the Sessions Court, Pathanamthitta as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to      communicate this order  to the

concerned court immediately.

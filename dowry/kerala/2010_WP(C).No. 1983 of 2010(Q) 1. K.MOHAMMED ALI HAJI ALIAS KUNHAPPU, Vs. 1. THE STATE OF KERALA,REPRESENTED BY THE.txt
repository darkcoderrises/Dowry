          Dated this the 17th day of June, 2010

                          JUDGMENT

     In this writ petition filed under Article 226 of

Constitution of India, the petitioner who is the father of 23

year old Femina, who died on 17.11.2009 in her matrimonial

home, seeks a direction to the 1st respondent, State of Kerala

to hand over the investigation of Crime No.777/09 of

Mannarkkad Police Station to the Central Bureau of

Investigation or to a Special Investigation Team to be

constituted.

     2.    Marriage between the 1st accused, Askaralikhan

and the petitioner's daughter Femina was on 22.7.2007. A

female child has been born in that wed lock. The 1st accused

belong to Kalladikode, Mannarkkad in Palakkad District and

the petitioner belongs to Melatur in Malappuram District. The

body of Femina was allegedly found hanging in her

matrimonial home on 17.11.2009.

     3.    The Mannarkkad Police registered the above crime

under caption "unnatural death" under Section 174 Cr.P.C.

Autopsy of the dead body of Femina was conducted by

W.P.(C). No.1983 OF 2010
                             : 2 :


Dr.P.B.Gujaral, District Police Surgeon, District Hospital,

Palakkad on 18.11.2009 at 1.25 P.M. There were altogether

23 ante-mortem injuries on the head and neck of deceased

Femina. The 3rd respondent, Deputy Superintendent of Police,

Shornur is the Officer, who is in charge of the investigation.

The petitioner has a contention that the 3rd respondent was

helping the accused as they are neighbours.

      4.     The 3rd respondent has filed a statement dated

11.3.2010 as per which he has inter alia stated as follows:-

      "Investigation so far made in this case disclosed

that accused Askarali Khan married the above said

Femina on 22.07.2007 as per religious custom.              The

parents of Askaralikhan had demanded 250 sovereigns

of gold ornaments and a Car to give Femina as dowry,

but Femina's parents gave 175 sovereigns of gold

ornaments to Femina during the time of marriage.

While Femina was residing in her husband's house her

husband Askarali Khan, his mother Laila, brother

Anwaralikhan         and sister   in   law   Gul    Fairoossa

continuously subjected her for mental and physical

torture      demanding    to  bring    the    remaining     75

sovereigns of gold ornaments and the Car from her

house, abetted her to commit suicide and on the

morning of 16.11.2009 & 17.11.2009 A1 Askaralikhan

W.P.(C). No.1983 OF 2010
                              : 3 :


assaulted her and due to the frustration in life following

their torture and abetment Femina committed suicide

by hanging inside the house of her husband situated at

Kalladikkode sometime in between 15.30 and 16.00 hrs.

on 17.11.2009. Based on the findings of investigation

the section of law was altered into Section 304 (B), 306

read with 34 IPC on 19.11.2009."

      5.     So far the persons, who have been arrayed as

accused are A1 Aksaralikhan, the husband of the deceased, A2

Laila, the mother of A1, A3 Gul Fairoossa, the sister of A1 and

A4 Anwaralikhan, the brother of A1. With regard to the cause

of death, the statement of the 3rd respondent as gathered

from the relatives of the deceased reads as follows:-

          "On     16.11.2009   and    17.11.2009      morning

Aksaralikhan assaulted Femina by beating with hands

following a wordily quarrel and on 17.11.2009 Femina

contacted her house at Melattur over phone several

times and wanted her father to reach there to bring her

to the house and to go to the hospital. Accordingly,

when her father reached at the house of Femina at

about 16.15 hrs. on 17.11.2009, he understood that

Femina was removed to the hospital for treatment and

when he reached at Lakshmi Nursing Home, Palakkad

he found his daughter Femina lying dead with ligature

mark on her neck and her husband or relatives were not

W.P.(C). No.1983 OF 2010
                               : 4 :


found in the Hospital. It is also ascertained from the

doctor that Femina died before reaching the Hospital."

      6.     The 3rd respondent would proceed to a conclusion

based on the findings in the investigation conducted by him

that the offences revealed are those punishable under Section

304B and 306 read with 34 IPC. These offences were

incorporated on 19.11.2009.

      7.     From the findings of the Autopsy Surgeon coupled

with his statement allegedly made under Section 161 Cr.P.C,

it cannot be conclusively held that the death of Femina was

suicidal hanging and not homicidal hanging. It appears that

after sustaining ante-mortem injuries described in Ext.P2 post

mortem certificate, Femina could not have been in a position

to commit suicide by hanging. A proper investigation does not

appear to have been conducted to rule out the possibilities of

a homicidal hanging. The conclusion reached that Femina

committed suicide on account of corporal torture by the four

accused persons, pursuant to the demand for more dowry and

thereby they abetted the suicide of Femina is open to doubt.

The apprehension expressed against the 3rd respondent

(investigating officer) also cannot be lost sight of.  Under

W.P.(C). No.1983 OF 2010
                                : 5 :


these circumstances, I am of the view that the investigation of

this case should be entrusted with the Crime Branch Police

under the able leadership of an officer not below the rank of a

Superintendent of Police with investigative skills and who will

bring the case to a logical conclusion through an unbiased

investigation. Accordingly, this writ petition is disposed of

directing the 2nd respondent to entrust the investigation of

Crime No.777/2009 of Mannarkkad Police Station with the

Crime Branch Police headed by an officer not below the rank

of Superintendent of Police.         It shall be open to the 2nd

respondent, either to constitute a Special Investigation Team

under the leadership of a Superintendent of Police so chosen

or to order further investigation under a single Officer of the

rank already mentioned and of unquestionable integrity and

with investigative skills. The 3rd respondent shall hand over

the investigation      files to the Director General of Police,

immediately.

                  ================
                 Crl.M.C. No. 653 of 2015
            =======================
           Dated this the 11th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R



     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.6 of 2015 of the

Pazhayannur     Police    Station  registered   for the    offence

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section    482   Cr.P.C.     for  getting  all   proceedings     in

C.M.P.No.8312/14 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Wadakkanchery and Annexure-I FIR based on it, in Crime No

No.6/15 of the Pazhayannur Police Station, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

Crl.M.C. No. 653 of 2015
                                  2

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all proceedings in the matter referred to

above can be quashed. She has entered appearance through

her counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in by the

defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.   Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

Crl.M.C. No. 653 of 2015
                                   3

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioners, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all proceedings in

C.M.P.No.8312/14 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Wadakkanchery and Annexure-I FIR based on it, in Crime No

No.6/15 of the Pazhayannur Police Station, are hereby quashed.

                  Dated this the 9th day of April 2015

                                     ORDER


      The petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime

No.1196/2013 of Nemmara Police Station, presently pending as

C.C. No.34 of 2014 before Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Alathur, have come up, under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure, for getting Annexure-A Final Report and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C. No.34/2014 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Alathur, quashed.

      2. The crime has been registered for offences punishable

under Sections 323, 498A and 506(i) read with Section 34 IPC.

The allegation against the petitioners is that they had tortured and

harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife of the first

Crl.M.C.1939/2015                   2

petitioner, and treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry

after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

       3. The parties are Muslims. It seems that all the pending

disputes between the parties have been settled through a

compromise and an agreement has been entered into. The parties

have effected an extra judiciary divorce. According to the

petitioners, all the disputes have been settled and the amounts due

to the defacto complainant, were paid.

       4.    The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit stating that the matter has been settled

and presently she has no complaints against the petitioners. She

has also prayed for quashing the proceedings based on Annexure-A

Final Report.

       5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the 1st respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      6. The first respondent has entered appearance through her

Crl.M.C.1939/2015                 3

counsel. The learned counsel for the first respondent has also

endorsed the affidavit sworn in by the first respondent and the

matters involved in the case have already been settled. When the

matters are settled, there is no meaning in proceeding further in the

matter and therefore, Annexure-A final report in C.C. No.34/2014

of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Alathur         and the

proceedings in the said case, are only to be quashed, and I do so.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, and Annexure-A final

report in C.C. No.34/2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, Alathur and all further proceedings in the said case, are

quashed.

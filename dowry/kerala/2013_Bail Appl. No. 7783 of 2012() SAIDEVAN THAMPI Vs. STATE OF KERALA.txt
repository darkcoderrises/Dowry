                                ORDER


          These applications filed under Sections 439 and 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure seek release of the

petitioners from custody in view of the fact that the petitioners

have been tendered pardon by the courts concerned in spite of

the bar under Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. contending that the

prohibition contained in the said provision cannot override the

inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and also that if it

is to be held that bar under Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. is

absolute, then it is constitutionally invalid and has to be struck

down.

          2. First on to the facts of each of these cases. In

B.A. No. 7783 of 2012 the petitioner was arrayed as the 11th

accused in Crime No. 565 of 2011 of Koipuram Police Station

and he is alleged to have committed offences along with the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 2

other accused        punishable under Sections 120B, 115, 143,

147, 148, 447, 302 and 308 read with Section 149 of the

Indian Penal Code. According to the petitioner, as on the date

of the commission of the incident he was aged only 18 years

his date of birth being 9.11.1993. He was studying in the

third semester at Amritha Vidhyalayam Engineering College,

Vallikkavu, Kollam. The petitioner had only accompanied his

friends to gymnasium on 20.11.2011 and he was unaware of

the intention, motive and design of the other persons who

were along with him. He had no idea or clue that the persons

with whom he had gone were intending to commit criminal

offences. Whatever that be, as a result of the act committed

by the other accused persons, the petitioner was also roped in

and he thus became an accused. He however volunteered to

make a full and complete disclosure of all the circumstances

within his knowledge relating to the offences and the other

persons and accepting his proposal he was tendered pardon.

His statement was recorded and the learned Chief Judicial

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 3

Magistrate tendered pardon to the petitioner on conditions

mentioned in the Section.

            3. It is pointed out that unfortunately the petitioner

was in custody and had not been released on bail at the time

when he was tendered pardon. After being tendered pardon,

he moved for bail but in view of Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C.,

his application was rejected.

            4. In B.A. No. 8607 of 2012, the petitioner is the 9th

accused in Crime No. 766 of 2012 of Pudukkad Police Station

and he stands accused of having committed offences

punishable under Sections 120B, 143, 147, 148, 341, 324,

326, 302 and 212 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. and also

under Section 27 of the Arms Act. The allegations against the

petitioner and the co-accused are that on 6.6.2012 at about

11p.m. the accused persons formed themselves into an

unlawful assembly and armed with deadly weapons attacked

the victim, who succumbed to his injuries. It is pointed out

that the petitioner was tendered pardon and at the relevant

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                4

time he was in custody and had not been released on bail. His

subsequent application for bail was rejected in view of the bar

under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

            5. Being satisfied that there is a prima facie case

established by the respective petitioners and feeling that the

continued incarceration of the petitioners may be unjustified,

this Court granted interim bail to the petitioners.

            6. The question posed is whether Section 306(4)(b)

of Cr.P.C. casts an absolute bar on courts from releasing the

person from custody who has been tendered pardon and who

at the relevant time was not on bail.

            7.    In view of the importance of the question

involved, Shri.Sunny Mathew was appointed as Amicus Curie.

Even though in these petitions, Union of India was impleaded

and the copies were served on the Standing Counsel, Union of

India felt it unnecessary to address the court on the issue

involved in these cases.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 5

            8. It is the contention of the petitioners that Section

306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C., though couched in a mandatory language,

is open to contextual and purposive interpretation and it

cannot be treated as one casting an absolute prohibition from

atleast the High Court exercising its inherent powers under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. and releasing the petitioners from custody

in justifiable circumstances. Alternatively, it is contended that

if the provision is to be treated as an absolute prohibition even

fettering the powers of the High Court under Section 482

Cr.P.C., then necessarily, it is ultra vires Articles 14, 16 and 21

of the Constitution of India, and will have to be struck down.

            9. Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan, learned Senior Counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Shri. Sunny Mathew, the learned

Amicus Curie, and Shri.Tom Jose Padinjarekkara, learned

Additional Director General of Prosecution, appearing for the

State, have submitted argument notes.

            10.      Shri. O.V.Radhakrishnan,       learned  Senior

Counsel appearing for the petitioners in these petitions

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                6

adopted a moderate approach and took the stand that it may

not be necessary to consider the constitutional validity of

Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. if the provision is interpreted in a

reasonable and purposive manner.          It is not necessary,

according to the learned Senior Counsel, to test the

constitutional validity of the provision in view of the fact that

Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. can be construed reasonably which

will enable the court to mould its reliefs accordingly. Striking

down of a provision as unconstitutional is the last resort and

that should be resorted to when no other option is available

and very sparingly. Learned Senior Counsel emphasized that

it is the word 'shall' appearing in Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C.

that seems to fetter the powers of the court in releasing the

person who has been tendered pardon and who is not already

on bail. According to the learned Senior Counsel, the purpose

of Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. is to be properly understood.

Learned Senior Counsel relying on the decision reported in

A.J.Peiris v. State of Madras (AIR 1954 SC 616) contended that

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                7

the moment a person is tendered pardon, he is deemed to

have been discharged and he is no longer an accused and his

status thereafter is that of a witness. Contingencies may arise

that releasing such a person immediately         may result in

drastic consequences and it is necessary to protect him and

for that purpose there may be need to keep him in custody

under the provisions of the Code.          It is to meet such

contingencies that the provision has been incorporated.

Learned counsel went on to point out that but for the power

given under Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. it would not have been

possible for any court to detain a person who has been

tendered pardon from custody, for,         the Code does not

envisage a witness being detained in custody indefinitely.

            11. Learned Senior Counsel Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan

contended that the word 'shall' and the nature of the provision

needs to be understood in the context with reference to the

purpose for which it has been enacted and merely because the

word 'shall' is there, it is not necessarily mandatory, as one

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                8

prohibiting any court from exercising any sort of power and

releasing a      person who has been tendered pardon from

custody. For the proposition that the word 'shall' need not be

treated as mandatory, learned Senior Counsel relied on the

decisions reported in M/s. Rubber House v. M/s. Exelsior

Needle Industries Pvt. Ltd. ((1989) 2 SCC 413), Collector of

Monghyar v. Keshav Prasad (AIR 1962 SC 1694), Naravan Rao

v. State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1957 SC 737) and Central

Bureau of Investigation v. R.S. Pai (2002(2) K.L.T. 149 (SC).

            12.    Learned Senior Counsel also contended that

going by the wording in Section 482 Cr.P.C., it is clear that the

powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is not fettered by any

provision in the Code. Dilating on the point, learned Senior

Counsel pointed out that if it is found that the person who has

been tendered pardon is destined to remain in custody by

virtue of the prohibition under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. it is

certainly unjustified and unreasonable. In such contingencies,

certainly powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is available to the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                9

High Court to exercise its discretionary power in proper

circumstances directing release of the person concerned from

custody. For the above proposition, learned Senior Counsel

relied on the decisions reported in Noor Taki v. State (AIR

1987 Rajasthan 52), Prem Chand v. State (1985 (1) Crimes 99)

and Kailash Nath v. State of Rajasthan (1998(1) WLC 766).

            13. With reference to the petitioner in B.A. 7783 of

2012, the learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that he is a

student who was undergoing his 3rd Semester in the

Engineering Course and the fetter, if so construed, imposed

by Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. affects his right to education,

which, according to the learned Senior Counsel, is violative of

Article 21 of the Constitution.      However, learned Senior

Counsel pointed out that it may not be necessary to strike

down the provision if the approach suggested by the learned

Senior Counsel initially is to be adopted and accordingly relief

is granted to the petitioner.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                10

            14. Learned Amicus Curie Shri. Sunny Mathew was

more severe in his attack. According to him, if the provision,

i.e., Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., is construed as an absolute bar

on power of the courts from releasing the person concerned

from detention, then it is constitutionally invalid as it violates

Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. He too relied on the

decision reported in A.J.Peris v. State of Madras (AIR 1954 SC

616) and contended that once pardon is tendered to an

accused, his character changes and he can no longer be

treated as an accused but only as a witness. To read Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. as a provision which enables the court to

detain a person in jail indefinitely cannot be treated as

reasonable      and   in accordance     with the  constitutional

provisions and is       ante thesis to criminal jurisprudence.

Dilating on the unconstitutionality of the provision, learned

counsel pointed out that may be that the classification

between persons on bail and persons not on bail could be

justified.    But    the constitutionality of a provision under

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 11

Articles 14, 16, 19 and 21 is to be tested on two grounds. The

classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia

which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped

together from others left out of the group and the differentia

must have       reasonable nexus to the object sought to be

achieved by the statute in question. Learned counsel relied on

several decisions which would show the scope and ambit of

Article 14. So also it was pointed out by the learned Amicus

Curie that the interpretation of Article 21 in Maneka Gandhi's

case (AIR 1978 SC 597) was that no one shall be deprived of

his life or personal liberty except by procedure established by

law.       Learned counsel went on to point out that even

assuming as already stated that classification between persons

who are already on bail and not on bail though may be

justifiable, the classification has no nexus to the object sought

to be achieved. If it is to be taken as that Section 306(4)(b)

Cr.P.C. is intended to protect a person who is tendered

pardon, to ensure that he satisfies the conditions under which

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                12

he is tendered pardon and also to ensure that he is available

for trial, these conditions are equally applicable to the persons

already on bail and they do not stand on a different footing. If

that be the position, there can be no distinction between the

persons already on bail and the persons in custody as regards

the nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the

provision. Learned counsel relied on the decisions reported in

Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (AIR 1978 SC 597), Francis

Coralie Mullin v. Union Territory of Delhi (AIR 1981 SC 746)

and several other decisions in support of his contention.

Learned Amicus Curie supported the alternative contention

that the     contention raised by Shri. O.V. Radhakrishnan as

regards the interpretation of the word 'shall' in Section 306(4)

(b) Cr.P.C. For the said purpose, he relied on the decisions

reported in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Babu Ram Upadhya (AIR

1961 SC 751) and Govind Lal Chaggan Lal Patel v. The

Agriculture Produce Market Committee (AIR 1976 SC 263) and

passages from several text books by renowned authors.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                13

            15.      Meeting  the  above   arguments,    learned

Additional D.G.P. contended that neither of the contentions

raised by the petitioners can be accepted.        Both the old

provision under the 1898 Code, namely, Section 337, and the

corresponding provision in the 1923 Code, namely Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., stipulate that a person who has been

tendered pardon and who has not been released on bail shall

not be released on bail until termination of trial. The word

used is 'shall' and that should be construed as a mandatory

provision. According to the learned Addl.D.G.P., the provision

is intended to serve a purpose and that purpose shall not be

defeated by      resorting to give a contextual and purposeful

interpretation or by unjustified striking down of the provision

as violative of Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution.

According to the learned Addl.D.G.P., there is a valid

classification under Section        306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C. and the

section is intended to serve an object and purpose, therefore,

it could not be said that the classification made under Section

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               14

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. has no nexus     to the object sought to be

achieved. Calling to his aid Section 362 Cr.P.C. and Section

19(3) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and also Section 18

of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act, it was contended by the learned Addl.D.G.P.

that those provisions have been construed as mandatory and

imposing a fetter on the court        to exercise the   power

conferred on them and there is no reason why the same

interpretation should not be adopted in the case of Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. also.

            16.     Learned Addl.D.G.P. Contended that infact

these aspects have been considered in a number of decisions

and he relied on the following decisions in support of his

contention:

      Bhawani Singh v. State (AIR 1956 Bhopal 4), Ayodhya

Singh v. State (1973 Crl. L.J. 768), In re Mukhesh Reddy (AIR

1958 AP 165), Smithlal v. State of Kerala (2012(4) K.L.T. 807),

Satya Narayan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan (2001 KHC 768),

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                15

State of A.P. v. Awad Bin Younus Yafai ((2013) 1 SCC 506),

State of H.P. v. A Parent of a Student of Medical College,

Shimla (1985 KHC 646), State of Kerala v. Manikantan Nair

(2001 KHC 668), Moti Lal v. State of M.P. (1994 KHC 1367),

State of U.P. v. Johri Mal (2004 KHC 993), Asif Hameed v

State of J. and K. (1989 KHC 787).

            17. Learned Addl.D.G.P. also contended that when

there is a specific bar under the Code, it is well settled that the

inherent power cannot be taken aid of to override the specific

bar imposed by the Section concerned.              For the said

proposition, learned Addl.D.G.P. relied on the decision

reported in Smithlal v. State of Kerala (2012 (4) K.L.T. 807)

and Keecheri Handloom Weavers' Co.op. Society Ltd. v. Sub

Divisional Magistrate (1981 KHC 386).

            18.    Before embarking on a consideration of the

rival contentions, it is useful to refer to the           relevant

provisions.      The three provisions which are relevant are

Sections 306, 307 and 308 Cr.P.C. They read as follows:

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   16

      "306. Tender of pardon to accomplice.- (1) With a view
      to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to
      have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to
      an offence to which this section applies, the Chief
      Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any
      stage of the investigation or inquiry into, or the trial of,
      the offence, and the Magistrate of the first class
      inquiring into or trying the offence, at any stage of the
      inquiry or trial, may tender a pardon to such person on
      condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the
      whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relative
      to the offence and to every other person concerned,
      whether as principal or abettor, in the commission
      thereof.
      (2) This section applies to-
      (a) any offence triable exclusively by the Court of Session
      or by the Court of a Special Judge appointed under the
      Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952;
      (b) any offence punishable with imprisonment which may
      extend to seven years or with a more severe sentence.
      (3) Every Magistrate who tenders a pardon under sub-
      section (1) shall record-
      (a) his reasons for so doing;
      (b) whether the tender was or was not accepted by the
      person to whom it was made, and shall, on application

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   17

      made by the accused, furnish him with a copy of such
      record free of cost.
      (4) Every person accepting a tender of pardon made
      under sub-section (1)-
      (a) shall be examined as a witness in the Court of the
      Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence and in the
      subsequent trial, if any;
      (b) shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in
      custody until the termination of the trial.
      (5) Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon
      made under sub-section (1) and has been examined
      under sub-section (4), the Magistrate taking cognizance
      of the offence shall, without making any further inquiry
      in the case, -
      (a) commit it for trial-
      (i) to the Court of Session if the offence is triable
      exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking
      cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate;
      (ii) to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the
      Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952, if the offence is
      triable exclusively by that Court;
      (b) in any other case, make over the case to the Chief
      Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself.
      307. Power to direct tender of pardon.- At any time
      after commitment of a case but before judgment is

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 18

      passed, the Court to which the commitment is made
      may, with a view to obtaining at the trial the evidence of
      any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly
      concerned in, or privy to, any such offence, tender a
      pardon on the same condition to such person.
      308. Trial of person not complying with conditions of
      pardon.- (1) Where, in regard to a person who has
      accepted a tender of pardon made under section 306 or
      section 307, the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his
      opinion such person has, either by wilfully concealing
      anything essential or by giving false evidence, not
      complied with the condition on which the tender was
      made, such person may be tried for the offence in
      respect of which the pardon was so tendered or for any
      other offence of which he appears to have been guilty in
      connection with the same matter, and also for the
      offence of giving false evidence :Provided that such
      person shall not be tried jointly with any of the other
      accused :
      Provided further that such person shall not be tried for
      the offence of giving false evidence except with the
      sanction of the High Court, and nothing contained in
      section 195 or section 340 shall apply to that offence.
      (2) Any statement made by such person accepting the
      tender of pardon and recorded by a Magistrate under

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   19

      section 164 or by a Court under sub-section (4) of
      section 306 may be given in evidence against him at
      such trial.
      (3) At such trial, the accused shall be entitled to plead
      that he has complied with the condition upon which
      such tender was made; in which case it shall be for the
      prosecution to prove that the condition has not been
      complied with.
      (4) At such trial, the Court shall -(a) if it is a Court of
      Session, before the charge is read out and explained to
      the accused;
      (b) if it is the Court of a Magistrate, before the evidence
      of the witnesses for the prosecution is taken,
      ask the accused whether he pleads that he has complied
      with the conditions on which the tender of pardon was
      made.
      (5) If the accused does so plead, the Court shall record
      the plea and proceed with the trial and it shall, before
      passing judgment in the case, find whether or not the
      accused has complied with the conditions of the pardon,
      and, if it finds that he has so complied, it shall,
      notwithstanding anything contained in this Code, pass
      judgment of acquittal."

                                20

            19.    Sections 306 and 307 Cr.P.C. correspond to

Sections 337 and 338 of the old Code of 1898. A close look at

Section 306 Cr.P.C. would show that while the Chief Judicial

Magistrate and the Metropolitan Magistrate concerned are

empowered to tender pardon during investigation, enquiry or

trial, the Judicial First Class Magistrate concerned can grant

pardon only during enquiry and         trial. The power under

Section 306 to tender pardon, whether it be by the CJM,

Metropolitan Magistrate or the JFCM concerned, is applicable

only    in  cases    where   the  offence   is punishable with

imprisonment which may extend to seven years or with more

severe sentence.       The provision also stipulates that every

Magistrate who tenders pardon under sub-section (1) shall

record his reasons for doing so and whether the tender was or

was not accepted by the person concerned. Section 306(1)

Cr.P.C. stipulates that the court may tender a pardon to the

person concerned on making a full and true disclosure of the

whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relating to

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               21

the offence and to every other person concerned. The wording

of Section 306(1) could indicate that it is not necessary that

the person who has been tendered pardon must be an accused

because the provision says that pardon would be tendered to a

person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned

in or privy to such offence.

            20. The Section is a clear exception to the principle

that no inducement shall be offered to a person to disclose

what he knows. It has been held that granting pardon and

examining approver as witness are at best a necessary evil.

The purpose of the Section seems to be that there may be

instances where inspite of proper and honest investigation,

evidence may not be available in cases of grave and serious

offences. Therefore, it becomes necessary to resort to Section

306 or Section 307 Cr.P.C. as the case may be to ensure that

the offenders do not escape from the clutches of law. Sections

306 and 307 Cr.P.C. have been enacted to enable the court to

obtain evidence which is not otherwise forthcoming.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  22




            21. Section 307 Cr.P.C. enables the court to which

the case is committed to tender pardon before judgment is

passed for, the same purpose as envisaged under Section 306

Cr.P.C. However, Section 307 stipulates that pardon should be

tendered on the same condition to such persons. The wording

'same condition' mentioned in Section 307 Cr.P.C. has been

construed as one confining to the conditions made mention of

in Section 306(1) Cr.P.C.

            22.    It is significant to notice that Section 307

Cr.P.C. does not indicate that the Sessions Court or the court

to which the case is committed, while tendering pardon, has to

record its reasons or to record whether the tendering was

accepted or not accepted.         It also does not contain the

conditions similar to Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

            23. Section 308 Cr.P.C. deals with a situation where

a person who has been tendered pardon does not comply with

the conditions of pardon. That provision relates to persons

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                23

who have been tendered pardon both under Sections 306 and

307 Cr.P.C.

            24. It would appear that the purpose of Section 306

(4)(b) Cr.P.C. is to protect the person who has been tendered

pardon from the wrath of the persons he has chosen to expose

and also that he is available as a witness at the time of trial. It

also contemplates a situation where undue advantage could be

taken by a crafty accused.

            25.      One of the questions that arises for

consideration is whether the prohibition under Section 306(4)

(b) Cr.P.C. is absolute and admits of no exception or leniency.

If that be so, can it withstand the test of constitutionality

under Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution. Of course,

the classification into two groups, namely, those persons who

are on bail and those persons not on bail may be justified. But

that may not by itself be sufficient. It is by now well settled

that the classification so made should have a nexus to the

object sought to be achieved.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 24

            26. After Maneka Gandhi's case, scope of Article 21

has kept on widening. It now takes in all facets of life. Illegal

curtailment      of  freedom    or  indiscriminate  confinement

certainly fall under the vice of Articles 14 and 21. Prima facie,

it would appear that there is some merit in the contention

raised by the learned Amicus Curie that the provision, namely,

Section 306(4)(b), cannot stand the test of constitutionality.

            27.       But   striking   down   a   provision   as

unconstitutional, as rightly pointed out by the learned Senior

Counsel Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan, is the last resort and should

be exercised in exceptional circumstances only and when no

other remedy is available.

            28.      Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan    has  raised   two

propositions. According to him, the word 'shall' appearing in

Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. need not be construed as mandatory

but only as directory, and two, the word 'shall' should takes its

colour in the context and purpose for which the provision is

enacted.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               25




            29. It must be said that the approach suggested by

the learned Senior Counsel Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan appears to

be reasonable and a possible view. As rightly pointed out by

the learned Senior Counsel, on tendering of pardon, if it is to

be construed that the accused stands discharged and he is in

the position of a witness, then his further detention in custody

could not be justified except under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

After the tendering of pardon, the subsequent custody of the

person     concerned   may   not    be   strictly  the   custody

contemplated under the other provisions of the Code, but the

subsequent custody is a qualified one        and the power of

detaining the person concerned is traceable only to Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

            30. The object and purpose of the provisions have

already been referred to. In the decision reported in Konajeti

Rajababu v. State of A.P. (2002 Crl.L.J. 2990), the law has been

summarized. In Ratanlal and Dhirajlal in the 'Commentary on

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   26

the Code of Criminal Procedure', Vol.2 at page 1079, the

authors have summarized it as follows:



      "1. The power to grant pardon enjoined under Ss. 306
      and 307 of the Code us a substantive power and it rests
      on the judicial discretion of the Court.
      2. The power of the Court is not circumscribed by any
      condition except the one, namely, that the action must
      be with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person
      who is supposed to have been directly or indirectly
      concerned in, or privy to, an offence.
      3. The Court has to proceed with great caution and on
      sufficient grounds recognizing the risk which the grant
      of pardon involved of allowing an offender to escape just
      punishment at the expense of the other accused.
      4. The secrecy of the crime and paucity of evidence,
      solely for the apprehension of the other offenders,
      recovery of the incriminating objects and production of
      the evidence otherwise unobtainable might afford
      reasonable grounds for exercising the power.
      5. The disclosure of the person seeking pardon must be
      complete.
      6. While tendering pardon, the Court should make an
      offer to the one least guilty among the several accused."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 27




            31. One has to note the difference in the wordings

in Sections 306 and 307 Cr.P.C. The distinctions are quite

obvious. In both Sections 306 and 307 Cr.P.C. the word used

is 'supposed' and it is by now well settled that it clearly shows

that the person tendered pardon need not actually be an

accused. The Section only mentions about someone who is

directly or indirectly connected with the offence. The word

'supposed' cannot be treated as meaning actual participation.

            32.    In the decision reported in A. Devendran v.

State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1998 SC 2821), it was held that the

words 'same conditions' occurring in Section 307 Cr.P.C. refers

to the conditions mentioned in Section 306(1) Cr.P.C. only,

i.e., the person who is tendered pardon should make a full

disclosure of whole of the circumstances within his knowledge

relating to the offence.

            33.     The main attack against Section 306(4)(b)

Cr.P.C. is that it is dependent on a fortuitous circumstance,

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                28

i.e., the person, who has obtained bail prior to being tendered

pardon to him, can enjoy the benefit of bail, while a person,

who happens to be in custody, who is tendered pardon, has to

languish in jail till the end of trial. According to the learned

counsel, there is no rhyme or reason for such a distinction

when the purpose and object intended to be achieved by

detaining a person who is not on bail applies equally to the

person on bail also, and there is no qualitative or quantitative

difference between the purpose, scope and object to be

achieved by Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. between a person on

bail and a person not on bail.

            34. There is yet another aspect.     A person who

comes to the aid of the State if he happens to be in custody at

the relevant time and he is tendered pardon, he is placed in a

disadvantageous position. If he has been fortunate enough to

get bail earlier, there is no provision by which his bail can be

cancelled and custody can be ordered. It would appear that

Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. amounts to judicial ransom. Probably

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                29

in good old days      when expeditious trial was possible and

much hardship might not have been caused to the person in

custody under the relevant provision.           The position is

considerably different now. Trial begins after a considerable

lapse of time, continues indefinitely and under those

circumstances, to let a person languish in jail only because he

chose to help the State in bringing the other offenders to

justice, seems to be unreasonable.

            35.    It may be that Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. has

certain objects to serve.    But under that guise, to impose

complete prohibition against the person being released from

custody defies logic and reason. Possibly one could say that

reasonable restrictions could be imposed. But to insist that a

person, who has been tendered pardon, if he is not on bail,

should continue to be in custody till end of trial seems

objectionable and illogical. It is also interesting to note that a

person, who is tendered pardon under Section 307 Cr.P.C. and

who is similarly placed as a person falling within the ambit of

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                30

Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., does not suffer from any such

inhibition or prohibition. In other words, the prohibition seen

engrafted     in Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. does not apply to a

person who is tendered pardon under Section 307 Cr.P.C. be

on bail or not. The absence of any such prohibition in Section

307 Cr.P.C. show that detention is not a mandatory condition.

One fails to understand the basis for the said detention, A

person tendered pardon either under Section 306 or under

Section 307 stand on the same footing and the reason to treat

them differently seen unjustified. However, one thing is clear

that detention of a person to whom pardon is tendered need

not necessarily be detained till end of trial. The court is not

overlooking the fact that pardon under Section 306 Cr.P.C.

could be during investigation, enquiry or trial while Section

307 Cr.P.C. applies only at the time of trial.    While under

Section 306 Cr.P.C. the person granted pardon may have to be

examined twice, such a contingency may not arise under

Section 307 Cr.P.C.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   31




             36.     One may at once consider             whether the

constitutional attack can be sustained. Initially, it may be seen

whether the differentia made in Sections 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. and

Section 307 Cr.P.C. is proper.       To uphold a provision, it must

fulfill two conditions, (i) the classification must be founded on

an intelligible differentia which distinguishes            persons or

things that are grouped together from others left out of the

group and (ii) such differentia must have a rational relation to

the object sought to be achieved by the statute or legislature

in question.

             37. In the decision reported in Ashutosh Gupta v.

State of Rajasthan (AIR 2002 SC 1533), it was observed as

follows:

             "In   order  to   pass   the test   of   permissible
       classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely (i)
       that the classification must be founded on an intelligible
       differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are
       grouped together from others who are left out of the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  32

      group, and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational
      relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act."




            38.      Unmerited detention and deprivation of

personal liberty now stands within Article 21 of the

Constitution and the said Article stares at one's face and

dealing with such situations in the decision reported in

Smt.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (AIR 1978 SC 597), it

was held as follows:

            "The expression 'personal liberty' in Art.21 is of
      the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights
      which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and
      some of them have been raised to the status of distinct
      fundamental rights and given additional protection
      under Art.19."

            39.    In the decision reported in     Unnikrishnan v.

State of A.P. (1993)1 SCC 645), it was held as follows:



            "Though Article 21 is worded in negative terms but
      it has both a negative and an affirmative dimension. The

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  33

      contention that it is only when the State makes a law
      taking away the right to education that Article 21 would
      be attracted, cannot be accepted. The first question is
      whether the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 does
      take in the right to education or not. It is then that the
      second question arises whether the State is taking away
      that right. The mere fact that the State is not taking
      away the right as at present does not mean that right to
      education is not included within the right to life. The
      content of the right is not determined by perception of
      threat.     The content of right to life is not to be
      determined on the basis of existence or absence of
      threat of deprivation. The effect of holding that right to
      education is implicit in the right to life is that the State
      cannot deprive the citizen of his right to education
      except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by
      law."

            40. In the decision reported in Bachan Singh v. State

of Punjab (AIR 1982 SC 1325), it was held as follows:

            "The Constitution of India is a unique document. It
      is not a mere pedantic legal text but it embodies certain
      human values, cherished principles and spiritual norms
      and recognises and upholds the dignity of man. It
      accepts the individual as the focal point of all

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   34

      development and regards his material, moral and
      spiritual development as the chief concern of its various
      provisions. It does not treat the individual as a cog in the
      mighty all powerful machine of the State but places him
      at the centre of the constitutional scheme and focuses
      on the fullest development of his personality. The
      various provisions of the Constitution are enacted for the
      purpose of ensuring the dignity of the individual and
      providing    for  his   material,    moral   and   spiritual
      development and they would be meaningless and
      ineffectual unless there is rule of law to invest them with
      life and force."

            41. Before going into the merits of the contentions,

one aspect may be noticed though has already been referred

to.    Section 306 Cr.P.C. deals with the powers of CJM,

Metropolitan Magistrate and JFCM. While the power granted to

the CJM and the Metropolitan Magistrate extends to granting

pardon during investigation, enquiry and trial, as far as the

courts after commitment are concerned, the right is confined

to the time during enquiry and trial. In Section 307 Cr.P.C.

where tendering of pardon is after the commitment of the case

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                35

to the court concerned, pardon may be tendered any time

before the judgment is passed.         The differences between

Sections 306 and 307 have already been noticed.              The

difference in the two provisions would indicate the fact that

the legislature felt that a higher forum will exercise its powers

with more care and caution. It was probably of that reason

that the conditions contained in Section 306 Cr.P.C. are not

imposed under Section 307 Cr.P.C.

            42.    A number of decisions have considered this

anomalous position and in most          of the decisions it is

observed that if there is nothing more, there is gross

discrimination and Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. will have to be

held arbitrary and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.

But in all those decisions, the court concerned stayed away

from declaring the provision unconstitutional by taking

recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C. and went on to hold that in the

light of the inherent power vested in the High Court which is

not limited or circumscribed by Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. in

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                36

proper cases the person concerned could be released from

custody.

            43.      Before going into those decisions, one

contention raised by the learned Addl.D.G.P needs to be

mentioned here. According to the learned Addl.D.G.P, the bar

under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. is similar to the bar under

Section 362 Cr.P.C., Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption

Act and Section 18 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled

Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It is contended that the

provisions above mentioned engraft absolute bar and when

there is a specific bar, Section 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be taken aid

of. For the above proposition, the learned Addl.D.G.P. relied

on the decisions reported in S.C. Bahri v. State of Bihar (AIR

1994 SC 2420), Motilal v. State of M.P. (1994 KHC 1367), State

of U.P. v. Johri Mal (2004 KHC 993), State of H.P. v. A Parent

of Student of Medical College, Shimla (1985 KHC 646), Asif

Hameed v. State of J and K. (1989 KHC 787),          and Satya

Narayan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan (2001 KHC 768).

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  37

Learned Addl.D.G.P. drew the attention of this Court to the

decision reported in Smithlal v. State of Kerala (2012 (4) K.L.T.

807), wherein it was held a follows:

            "In the light of the       clear interdiction and
      prohibition under S.306(4) Cr.P.C., it is not possible to
      entertain the contention that once tendered pardon, the
      person ceases to be an accused and thereafter under
      S.482    Cr.P.C.,  bail can   be   granted     cannot   be
      countenanced. At least in the case covered by S.306
      Cr.P.C., where pardon is tendered by either the CJM or
      Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate of the
      First Class in the circumstances already made mention
      of, the interdiction under S.306(4) Cr.P.C. clearly applies
      and the court is precluded from releasing the petitioner
      from custody except possibly by Apex Court exercising
      its plenary powers."

            44.      Ratanlal    and   Dhirajlal     in   their  work

'Commentary on the Code of Criminal Procedure'                   18th

Enlarged Edition 2006, Vol.2 at page 1087 under note 34

mentions as follows:

            "The object of requiring an approver to remain in
      custody until the termination of the trial is not to punish

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 38

      the approver for having agreed to give evidence for the
      State, but to protect him from the wrath of the
      confederates he has chosen to expose, to prevent him
      from the temptation of saving his erstwhile friends and
      companions and to secure his person to await the
      judgment of the law. The temptation on the part of an
      approver to flee from justice as a result of threat or
      coercion is supposed to outweigh all inducements to
      remain growing out of pecuniary obligation, no matter to
      what amount."

The learned Authors further observes           under Note 36 as

follows:

            "Reasonably expeditious trial is warranted by the
      provisions of the Code and in case this is not done and
      an approver is detained for a period which is longer than
      what can be considered to be reasonable in the
      circumstance of each case, the High Court has always
      power to declare his detention either illegal or enlarge
      him on bail which         exercising inherent powers.
      According to S.306(4)(b) the approver should be
      detained in custody till the termination of trial, if he is
      not already on bail, at the same time, in exceptional
      and reasonable cases the High Court has powers under
      S.482 to enlarge him on bail or in case there are

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   39

      circumstances to suggest that his detention had been so
      much prolonged which would          otherwise outlive the
      period of sentence, if convicted, his detention can be
      declared to be illegal, as violative of Art. 21 of the
      Constitution. Detention of a person even by due process
      of law has to be reasonable, fair and just and if it is not
      so, it will amount to violation of Art.21 of the
      Constitution. Where neither no useful purpose will be
      served by his further detention nor administration of
      justice is likely to be adversely affected, the Court may
      release him on bail."

            45. In the decision reported in Pascal Fernandes v.

State of Maharashtra (AIR 1968 SC 594), it was held as

follows:

            "12.   There can be no doubt that the section is
      enabling and its terms are wide enough to enable the
      Special Judge to tender a pardon to any person who is
      supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned
      in, or privy to, an offence. This must necessarily include
      a person arraigned before him. But it may be possible to
      tender pardon to a person not so arraigned. The power
      so conferred can also be exercised at any time after the
      case is received for trial and before its conclusion. There

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  40

      is nothing in the language of the section to show that
      the Special Judge must be moved by the prosecution. He
      may consider an offer by an accused as ion this case.
      The action, therefore, was not outside the jurisdiction of
      the Special Judge in this case."

             46.   In the decision reported in State of U.P. v.

Kailash Nath (AIR 1973 SC 2210), it was held as follows:

             "15. The decisions referred to above clearly
      establish that the powers conferred on the District
      Magistrate and the other Magistrates under Section 337
      are concurrent and that a District Magistrate, even after
      commitment, has power to tender pardon. The Proviso to
      Section 337 (1) makes it clear that the District
      Magistrate, in addition to the Magistrates referred to
      therein, has power to tender pardon during inquiry into
      or trial of the offence. Though the above decisions had
      no occasion to consider whether the District Magistrate
      has power to tender pardon,when the Magistrate
      enquiring into the offence has once refused, we are not
      able to find any such restriction placed upon the power
      of the District Magistrate by the wording of the section
      itself. As the power conferred by sub-section (1) of
      Section 337 on the different classes of Magistrates is
      concurrent and is of the same character it follows that

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   41

      the power to tender pardon can be exercised by every
      one of the authorities mentioned therein subject to the
      limitations specified in the section itself. The mere fact
      that a Magistrate of the First Class enquiring into the
      offence has declined to grant pardon as in the case
      before us, does not take away the power or jurisdiction
      of the District Magistrate to entertain a further
      application for grant of pardon. Though the District
      Magistrate has got power to consider a further
      application, nevertheless, it is needless to state that he
      will have due regard to the views expressed by the
      Magistrate for refusing to grant pardon. We must,
      however, state that judicial propriety requires "that if a
      higher authority had declined to tender pardon a lower
      authority should not grant pardon except on fresh facts
      which were not and could not have been before the
      higher authority when it declined to grant pardon. Even if
      pardon has been refused on one occasion, a further
      request may be made before the same Magistrate or the
      District Magistrate. But such a further request can be
      entertained and considered only if fresh or additional
      facts are placed by the party concerned.
            16. The above principles will apply even to
      proceedings under Section 338. Even after commitment,
      a District Magistrate will have power to grant pardon, But

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   42

      if the court of Session had declined to grant pardon, the
      District Magistrate will not on the same facts entertain a
      similar application for grant of pardon. It is necessary to
      bear in mind the principles stated above so that the
      authorities under Sections 337 and 338 can exercise
      jurisdiction in harmony in order to further the interest of
      justice and avoid conflicting orders being passed."

            47. The power of tendering pardon was considered

in the decision reported in A.J. Peris v. State of Madras (AIR

1954 SC 616). In the decision reported in Phulan Shah v. State

of Uttar Pradesh (2002 Crl.L.J. 1520), it was held as follows:



            "9. In this case, pardon was granted by the Chief
      Judicial Magistrate under Section 306 Cr.P.C. The object
      of tendering pardon as contained in Section 306 Cr.P.C.
      is with a view to obtaining evidence of any person
      supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned
      in or privy to an offence for making a full and true
      disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his
      knowledge relative to the offence and to every other
      person concerned, whether as principal or abettor in the
      commission thereof. The object of the provision is to
      allow pardon to be tendered in cases where grave

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   43

      offence is alleged to have been committed by several
      persons, so that with the aid of the evidence of the
      person pardoned, the offence could be brought book to
      the rest. This object is to secure the evidence of such a
      person.
            10.    The effect of tendering pardon has been
      considered by the Full Bench of Apex Court in the case
      of A.J. Peiris v. State of Madras, AIR 1954 SC 616. It was
      held in paragraph 9 of the said case as below:-
            "We think that the moment the pardon was
      tendered to the accused he must be presumed to have
      been     discharged whereupon he ceased top be an
      accused and became a witness."
            11. This aspect was also considered by the Apex
      Court in a recent decision in the case of Jasbir Singh v.
      Vipin Kumar Jaggi (2001 6 JT (SC) 419 and it was held in
      paragraph 29 of the said case as below:-
      "The object of Section 64 of N.D.P.S. Act being the same
      as Section 307, it should logically follow that it may be
      exercised at any time during the course of the trial. It is
      true that the words 'immunity from prosecution' have
      been used, but the phrase does not mean anything more
      than the power to withdraw from prosecution. That, as
      has been noted earlier, can be exercised at any time in
      the course of the trial, but before judgment is delivered."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   44




            48. Now, one may turn to the decisions relied on by

the parties in relation to their respective contentions. In the

decision reported in Bhawani Singh v. State (AIR 1956 Bhopal

4), the Constitutional validity of old Section 337 Cr.P.C. was

considered and its constitutionality was upheld. In the said

decision it was held as follows:

            "(5) It is within the powers of the Legislature to lay
      down which person can be released on bail or to whom
      bail cannot be granted. As the rule applies to all the
      approvers     it cannot    be  said   that  it   makes    a
      differentiation and on this ground is contrary to the
      provisions of the Constitution of India."

One may at once notice that in the above decision, the High

Court only dealt with the question regarding the classification

and did not consider whether the classification had any nexus

to the object sought to be achieved.

            49. In the decision reported in Karuppa Servai v.

Kundaru (AIR 1952 Madras 833), it was held as follows:

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   45

            "Neither the enquiring Magistrate nor the Sessions
      Judge has got the right to set at naught the mandatory
      provisions of S.337(3) based on very salutary principles
      of public policy and public interest, and release an
      approver who is not on bail at the time of his acceptance
      of the tender of pardon, after the approver has deposed
      only in the committing Magistrate's Court, that is, in the
      course of the preliminary and, if committal ensues,
      before he has deposed at the trial in the Sessions Court
      truly and fully to matters within his knowledge.        An
      approver cannot be put in the same position as an
      accused, and the provisions of Ss.497 and 498, cannot
      apply to him. Even if they apply, it would not be a fit
      case for releasing an approver on bail in a murder case."

            50. In the decision reported in In re. Krishna Reddi

(AIR 1952 Madras 839), it was held as follows:

            "An approver who was in remand when he was
      tendered a pardon must be detained in custody under
      S.337(3) till the terminal of the trial if committal ensues
      or till the termination of the enquiry if committal does
      not ensue. The fact that he is said to have turned hostile
      is immaterial."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  46

            51.    In the decision reported in Dev Krishnan v.

State of Rajasthan (1984 Crl.L.J. 1142), it was held as follows:

            "5. Section 439 Cr.P.C. cannot be called in aid by
      the petitioner.    The provisions of S. 306(4)(b) are
      independent. They are not ancillary or subordinate to
      the provisions of S.439 Cr.P.C. The provisions of S.306
      (4)(b) are of special nature and override the general
      provisions of bail contained in S.439 Cr.P.C.       It is a
      well-settled principle of law that general provisions will
      give way and bow before the special provisions. In other
      words, S.306(4)(b) acts as an exception to S.439.
            6. The position, which thus emerges out is that an
      approver, if he is not on bail at the time of accepting the
      tender of pardon, shall be detained in custody until the
      termination of the trial.      During trial, there is no
      provision to release him on bail or otherwise.
            7. It is true that the accused persons facing the
      trial have been released on bail. But that can hardly be
      taken as a valid ground to subvert or circumvent the
      mandatory provisions of S.306(4)(b)."

            52. In the decision reported in Prem Chand v. State

(1985 (1) Crimes 99), it was held as follows:

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   47

            "20. It will not be out of place to mention that
      when this matter was before Single Judge, it was argued
      on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of Section
      306(4) (b) in all its rigidity may land itself to
      constitutional challenge on the ground of being violative
      if Article 21 read with Article 14 of the Constitution for
      being arbitrary and unreasonable and in this background
      one of us while making the reference order felt that if
      this Section applies in all its rigidity, it may have to be
      struck down. But since we find that in cases of hardship,
      the approver can approach this Court for for release, we
      thought it fit not to go into the question of vires of this
      provision. In fact, but for the availability of this power
      with the High Court to release the approver perhaps the
      vires of Section 306(4)(b) of the Code of Criminal
      Procedure may be open to serious challenge."

            53. In the decision reported in Noor Taki v. State of

Rajasthan (1986 Crl.L.J. 1488), it was held as follows:

            "15. Aforesaid perusal of the various authorities
      and on a careful consideration of S.306(4)(b) and S.439
      Cr.P.C. we have absolutely no hesitation in holding that
      provisions of S.439 Cr.P.C. do not apply in a case of
      approver in view of the bar under S.306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.
      There can be no doubt that when the Legislature enacted

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 48

      S.306(4)(b), there was an object behind them and they
      did so because they were of the opinion that the
      approver must make a complete and correct disclosure
      of entire facts and circumstances. He must disclose to
      the court his knowledge which he possess due to his
      involvement in the crime.    He has to give statement
      which is not only exculpatory but is inculpatory and in
      case he is released on bail, a situation may arise where
      relations of the caused or the accused themselves who
      are on bail, may win over the approver or threaten with
      dire consequences and he may abscond, there may be
      chances that he may completely be evaporated. When
      these provisions are enacted, at the same time,
      Legislature enacted the provisions about recording of
      evidence in Sessions case or in a warrant trial before a
      Magistrate. It was expected in a Sessions case that once
      the prosecution case starts, the learned Sessions Judge
      would record the evidence day to day till the trial is
      completed and in the Court of Magistrates the maximum
      period for detention of an accused in custody was
      limited to six months. Even during the investigation the
      Legislature gave a mandate that accused shall not be
      detained for more than 90 days in a murder case and for
      more than 60 days in other cases.       Therefore, it was
      never contemplated that a trial will take inordinate delay

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  49

      in its termination and not only the accused but approver
      shall also be detained in custody.     Accused has been
      given a right to apply for the bail but the approver not,
      as is apparent from the bare perusal of S.439 Cr.P.C,.
      Therefore, a circumstance may arise due to prolonged
      trial even when the approver has been examined and has
      supported the prosecution case, he may be detained in
      jail despite the fact that even the principal accused has
      been granted bail. It is in these circumstances that the
      question arises, whether an approver should be granted
      indulgence of being released from detention or his
      liberty should be curtailed for no fault on his part.
      Argument has been advanced by Mr.Dhankar that such a
      prolonged detention of the accused is violative of Art.21
      of the Constitution, and further that S.306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.
      may be declared as directory and not mandatory.
            16.    Taking the second point first, there is no
      question of holding whether S.306(4)(b) is directory or
      mandatory as there is no specific provision in the entire
      Cr.P.C. which gives a right to the approver to apply for
      bail. As mentioned above S.439 Cr.P.C. does not apply
      to an approver. It applies only to 'a person accused of
      an offence'. An approver when once granted pardon, no
      more remains an accused unless he violates the
      conditions of pardon and subsequently tried for the

                                  50

      offence.   Hence   as an approver his status is that of
      witness and not that of the accused.       That being so,
      S.439 Cr.P.C. would not apply and consequently the
      discussion on the point whether S. 306(4)(b) is directory
      or mandatory, is merely an academic exercise and that
      too in futility. So far as the provision of S. 439 Cr.P.C.
      being violative of Art.21 of the Constitution, suffice to
      say that argument has been advanced only to be
      rejected. Approver, as a matter of right, cannot claim
      bail and as mentioned above there is no           provision
      granting him bail. We have already discussed above the
      reasons which appear to us persuaded the Legislature
      not to make a provision for granting bail to an approver.
      But Art.21 of the Constitution can be looked into for
      seeking an aid to the contention that the         scope of
      inherent powers of this Court should be so explained so
      as to cover the cases of an approver for consideration of
      bail in proper cases.    In Francis Coralis Mullin's case,
      their Lordships of the Supreme Court defined the scope
      of Art.21 of the Constitution. In that case the petitioner
      had challenged his detention under COFEPOSA Act and
      an    argument     was     advanced     challenging    the
      constitutional validity of certain clauses of the detention
      order. Their Lords held.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   51

            "It is not enough to secure compliance with the
      prescription of Article 21 that there should be a law
      prescribing some semblance of a procedure for depriving
      a person of his life or personal liberty. but the procedure
      prescribed by the law must be reasonable, fair and just
      and if it is not so, the law would be void as violating the
      guarantee of Article 21. This Court expanded the scope
      and ambit of the right to life and personal liberty
      enshrined in Article 21 and sowed the seed for future
      development of the law enlarging this most fundamental
      of Fundamental Rights. This decision in Meneka Gandhi's
      case became the starting point the spring-board for a
      most spectacular evolution of the law culminating in the
      decisions in M. O. Hoskot v. State of Maharashtra, (1978
      Cri LJ 1978), Hussainara Khatoon's case, (1980)1 SCC 81)
      the first Sunil Batra's case (1978 Cri LJ 1741) and the
      second Sunil Batra's case (1980 Cri LJ 1099).The position
      now is that Article 21 as interpreted in Maneka Gandhi's
      case (supra) requires that no one shall be deprived of his
      life or personal liberty except by procedure established
      by law and this procedure must be reasonable, fair and
      just and not arbitrary, whimsical or fanciful and it is for
      the Court to decide in the exercise of its constitutional
      power of judicial review whether the deprivation of life or
      personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                    52

      reasonable, fair and just or it is otherwise."
            19. A perusal of the aforesaid cases coupled with
      that of many other cases, like that of Sunil Batra v. Delhi
      Administration and yet another case of Hussainara
      Khatoon reported in AIR 1979 SC 1360, 23 have no
      hesitation in holding that detention of a person even by
      due process of law has to be reasonable, fair and just
      and if it is not so, it will amount to violation of Art.21 of
      the Constitution.       Reasonable expeditious trial is
      warranted by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure
      Code and in case this is not done and an approver is
      detained for a period which is longer than what can be
      considered to be reasonable in the circumstances of
      each case, this Court has always power to declare his
      detention either illegal or enlarge him to bail while
      exercising its inherent powers. Section 482 Cr.P.C. gives
      wide power to this court in three circumstances. Firstly,
      where the jurisdiction is invoked to give effect to an
      order of the Court. Secondly if there is an abuse of the
      process of the court and thirdly, in order to secure the
      ends of justice. There may be occasions where a case
      of approver may fall within latter two categories. For
      example in a case where there are large number of
      witnesses a long period is taken in trial where
      irregularities and illegalities  have been committed by

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  53

      the Court and re-trial is ordered and while doing so, the
      accused persons are released on bail, the release of the
      approver will be occasioned for securing the ends of
      justice. Similarly, there may be cases that there may be
      an abuse of the process of the Court and the accused
      might be trying to delay the proceedings by absconding
      one after another, the approver may approach this Court
      for seeking indulgence. But this too will depend upon
      the facts and circumstances of each case. Broadly, the
      parameters may be given but no hard and fast rule can
      be laid down For instance, an approver, who has already
      been examined and has supported the prosecution
      version, and has also not violated the terms of pardon
      coupled with the fact that no early end of the trial is
      visible, then he may be released by invoking the powers
      under S.482 Cr.P.C., Section 482 Cr.P.C. gives only
      power to the High Court. Sessions Judge cannot invoke
      the provisions of the same.     High Court therefore in
      suitable cases can examine the expediency of the release
      of an approver.      We are not inclined to accept the
      contention of the learned Public Prosecutor that since
      there is a specific bar under S.306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. S. 482
      Cr.P.C. should not be made applicable. Their Lordships
      of the Supreme Court has said in times without number,
      that there is nothing in the Code to fetter the powers of

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                      54

      the High Court under S.482 Cr.P.C.. Even if there is a
      bar in different provisions for the three purposes
      mentioned in S.482 Cr.P.C. and one glaring example
      quoted is that though S.397 gives a bar for interference
      with interlocutory orders yet S.482 Cr.P.C., has been
      made applicable in exceptional cases. Second revision
      by the same petitioner is barred yet this Court in
      exceptional cases invoke the provisions of S.482 Cr.P.C.
      Therefore, S.482 Cr.P.C. gives ample power to this
      Court.    However, in exceptional cases to enlarge the
      approver on bail, we answer the question that according
      to S.306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. the approver should be detained in
      custody till the terminal of trial, if he is not already on
      bail, at the same time, in exceptional and reasonable
      cases the High Court has power under S.482 Cr.P.C. to
      enlarge him on bail or in case there are circumstances to
      suggest that his detention had been so much prolonged,
      which would other outlive the period of            sentence, if
      convicted, his detention can be declared to be illegal, as
      violative of Art.21 of the Constitution."

            54. In the decision reported in T.P.Mohideen v State

of Madras (AIR 1965 Madras 461), it was held as follows:

            "2...... It will be totally unjustifiable to attack S.337
      Cr.P.C.   a provision enacted for the purpose of

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  55

      facilitating the securing of evidence to establish a
      criminal offence on the ground that that section favours
      on accused person, who is prepared to turn King's
      evidence, at the expense of the other accused. Even an
      accomplice so selected for the award of pardon, cannot
      be said to have obtained complete exoneration from
      guilt.    He has to comply with the terms of the
      undertaking on which pardon had been granted, and in
      the event of his violating the undertaking, he will, at the
      discretion of the authorities and on the certificate of the
      Public Prosecutor, be made to face a trial in the court.
      Actually, the provision for terming pardon is extended
      even beyond the stage of investigation, to the stage of
      trial under Section 338 Cr.P.C. which provides that any
      time after commitment but before judgment is made,
      the court to which the commitment is made may, with a
      view of obtaining on the trial the evidence of any person
      supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned
      in, or privy to, any such offence, tender, or order the
      committing Magistrate or the District Magistrate to
      tender a pardon on the same condition (as in S.337
      Cr.P.C.) to such a person. But S. 338 is not the section
      to which reference is made in that writ petition.
             3. The second contention of the learned counsel
      appearing in this writ petition for the petitioner, is that

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   56

      S. 337 Cr.P.C. offends Art.14 of the Constitution which
      states that the State shall not deny to any person
      equality before the law or the equal protection of the
      laws within the territory of India. There is no question in
      the present case of the denial of equal protection to all
      the accused involved in the case. It is alleged that the
      petitioner is the third accused, in a criminal case in the
      court of the Sessions Judge, Madras, where they are
      being charged for offences of passing off spurious gold
      articles as genuine gold articles. The grievance of the
      petitioner appears to be that when there are a number of
      persons involved in an offence, discrimination within the
      meaning of Art. 14 would be involved, when          one is
      given pardon under S. 337 Cr.P.C. and the others are
      prosecuted. This clearly involves a misconception of the
      scope of Art.11. This is not a case of failure to give
      protection to the accused who are prosecuted. It is a
      case of refraining from prosecution of one accused for
      certain reasons enjoined by the statute in the interests of
      the successful prosecution of certain other persons, and
      getting the best evidence possible against them.         It
      appears to me that the reference to Art. 14 of the
      Constitution for this purpose, is wholly otiose.
            4. The third contention of the petitioner is that
      Gurunathan to whom pardon has been granted is the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  57

      principal offender, while the petitioner and some others,
      who are arraigned as accused in the sessions court,
      Madras, are only abettors or persons concerned in the
      offence in a relatively minor way.        This argument
      overlooks the terms of S.387 itself, which provided that
      pardon could be given to a person concerned in the
      offence whether as principal or abettor. Reference made
      by the learned counsel for the petitioner, to a decision of
      the Patna High Court in Sheobhajan Abir v. Emperor AIR
      1921 Pat. 499 appears to be wholly irrelevant, because
      that was a case where the person to whom pardon was
      given appeared to have been the real culprit, while the
      persons who were prosecuted were not so. There was
      no question of a principal offendor and one who was
      only an abettor, in that case.     Further, any defect or
      impropriety in the grant of pardon, will be a ground on
      which the accused can attack the evidence of the
      approver as and when he gives evidence, for the purpose
      of reducing the value of his testimony.         It will be
      certainly no ground for quashing the order of granting
      pardon. The result of any such order will be to put a
      brake in giving effect to the statutory provisions for
      investigation of criminal offences, and it may also serve
      to obstruct the course of justice."

                                   58

             55. In the decision reported in Ayodhya Singh v.

State (1973 Cri.L.J. 768), it was held as follows:

             "2. Section 337(3) Criminal P.C. Runs as follows:-
             "Such person unless he is already on bail, shall be
      detained in custody until the termination of the trial."
      The word 'shall' has been used in sub-section (3). It is
      true   that   the  nature   of  any   provision   whether
      descretionary or mandatory is not to be construed from
      the word 'shall' or 'may' used therein. In certain cases,
      the shall' can be regarded to be not of a mandatory
      nature if on consideration of enactment as a whole it
      appears that the discretion has been left open for the
      Court. A bare reading of sub-section (3) would reveal
      that the general powers of the court regarding granting
      of bail had been taken away by this sub-section. In the
      sub-section the Legislature has not only used the word
      'shall' but it is preceded by the words 'unless he is
      already on bail'. These words clearly suggest that the
      Legislature has prohibited the court from passing
      contrary orders. The word 'shall' in the present context
      must be deemed to be of mandatory nature. According
      to   sub-section (3), an approver has to be kept in
      custody till the termination of the trial. He is not to be
      allowed to be let off on bail when he is not on bail at

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  59

      the time he is tendered pardon. It is not the case of the
      petitioner that he was on bail on the date he was made
      approver or tendered pardon. The case of the petitioner
      stands fully covered      by sub-section (3) of S.337
      Criminal P.C.    The petitioner has stated that a long
      period of time would be spent in concluding the trial as
      the prosecution has cited 174 witnesses in the case.
      Delay in disposal of the case cannot be considered a
      valid ground where the law prohibits the release of the
      approver fill the termination of the trial."

            56. In the decision reported in In re Mukesh Reddy

(AIR 1958 AP 165), it was held as follows:

      "Sub-section (3) reads:-

            "Such person unless he is already on bail, shall be
      detained in custody until the termination of the trial."
      The word 'shall' in the sub-section is primarily obligatory
      and it casts a duty on a court to detain an accused, to
      whom pardon was tendered, in custody until the
      termination of the trial.   But, it does not make such
      detention the condition of the validity of the pardon.   It
      is designed to achieve the object for which pardon is
      tendered and to see that it is not frustrated.
            The accused, to whom pardon is tendered being an
      infamous person susceptible of easy accessibility, may

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   60

      be tampered with or the co-accused if on bail or persons
      interested in them who would necessarily be infuriated
      by his treachery may attempt to do away with him. It
      may be that the provision has been enacted to protect
      him and to preserve his evidence untampered with till
      the termination of the trial.      His release on bail in
      contravention of the sub-section is illegal and may be
      liable to be set aside by a superior court but does not
      touch the validity of the pardon."

            57. In the decision reported in A.L. Mehra v. State

(AIR 1958 Punjab 72), it was held as follows:

            "Sub Section (3) of S.337 declares that an approver,
      unless he is already on bail, shall be detained in custody
      until the termination of the trial. The object of requiring
      an approver to remain in custody until the termination of
      the trial is not to punish the approver for having agreed
      to give evidence for the State, but to protect him from
      the wrath of the confederates he has chosen to expose,
      to prevent him from the temptation of saving his
      erstwhile friends and companions and to secure his
      person to await the judgment of the law. Hence, the
      argument that if an accused can be released on bail,
      there is no reason why a person who has been granted a
      pardon should not be accorded a similar facility, is

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  61

      devoid of force, for the provisions of law cannot be
      extended by analogy.
            No pardon can, under S.337, Cr.P.C., be granted in
      respect of an offence under S.5 of the Official Secrets Act
      as this offence is punishable only with imprisonment
      which may extend to two years, or in respect f an
      offence under S. 120B of the Penal Code as this offence
      is not triable exclusively by the High Court or Court of
      Session.
            The expression "the offence" in S.337(2) refers to
      the    offence in respect of which pardon has been
      granted under the provisions of subs.(1).          Where,
      therefore, the offences in respect of which the accused
      are being prosecuted are not offences in respect of
      which pardon has been given under sub-s. (1) no duty
      is imposed upon the State to examine the so-called
      approver, or upon such approver to give evidence, in this
      capacity as an approver. He can give evidence only in
      his capacity as a witness.
            And as such an approver is an approver only for
      the purposes of the case in respect of which pardon was
      granted and that he can be detained in custody till the
      termination of the trial of the case under S.5 of the
      Official Secrets Act and he      cannot be kept in the
      confinement till the termination of the trial of the said

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  62

      case.
            The provisions relating to bail contained in Ss. 497
      and 498 do not override the provisions of sub-s.(3) of
      S.337: hence it is not within the competence of the Court
      to admit an approver to bail when the law declares in
      unambiguous language that an approver shall not be
      released until the decision of the case. The provisions
      contained in sub-s. (3) of S.337 must be read as an
      exception to the general provisions contained in Ss. 497
      and 498 for it is an old and familiar principle that the
      special provision overrides the general.
            The use of the word "shall" ion sub-2. (3) of S.337
      indicates that the Legislature has imposed a statutory
      and an imperative obligation on the Court to detain an
      approver in custody until the conclusion of the trial even
      when the prosecution of a case has been unreasonably.
            Sub-section (3) of S.337 implies that there is a trial
      in progress and its object is to secure the evidence of
      the approver for such trial, If there is no such trial and
      no likelihood of such a trial then cessante reatione lex
      ipsa cessa. And in such a case the inherent powers of
      the High Court can, to prevent the abuse of the process
      of the Court, be exercised in favour of a person who has
      been in confinement for several months.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  63

            I am in general agreement with the view taken by
      the learned Sessions Judge and am of the opinion that
      A.L.Mehra is not an approver for the purposes of this
      Case, that the proceedings in the Court of the additional
      District Magistrate are not inquiry proceedings but trial
      proceedings, that the Delhi Courts have jurisdiction to
      hear and determine the case against the prisoners and
      that it is not necessary to supply the coples            of
      documents as a matter of right. Mehra should be
      released on bail on furnishing security to the satisfaction
      of the District Magistrate, Delhi.        I would order
      accordingly."




            58. In the decision reported in S.C. Bahri v. State of

Bihar (AIR 1994 SC 2420), it was held as follows:

            "34. As regards the contention that the trial was
      vitiated by reason of the approver Ram Sagar being
      released on bail contrary to the provisions contained in
      clause (b) of sub -sec.(4) of S. 306 of the Code, it may
      be pointed out that Ram Sagar after he was granted
      pardon by the learned Magistrate by his order dated 9-
      1-85, he was not granted bail either by the committing
      Magistrate    or by   the  learned   Additional    Judicial

      Commissioner to whose Court the case was committed
      for trial. The approver Vishwakarma was, however,
      granted bail by an order passed by the High Court of
      Patna, Ranchi Bench in Criminal Misc. Case No. 4735/86
      in pursuance of which he was released on bail on 21-1-
      87 while he was already examined as a witness by the
      committing Magistrate on 30-1-86 and 31-1-86 and
      his statement in Sessions trial was also recorded from
      6-9-86 to 19-11-86. It is no doubt true that clause (b)
      of S. 306(4) directs that the approver shall not be set at
      liberty till the termination of the trial against the
      accused persons and the detention of the approver in
      custody must end with the trial. The dominant object of
      requiring an approver to be detained in custody until the
      direction of the trial is not intended to punish the
      approver for having come forward to give evidence in
      support of the prosecution but to protect him from the
      possible indignation, rage and resentment of his
      associates in a crime to whom he has chosen to expose
      as well as with a view to prevent him from the
      temptation of saving his one time friends and
      companions after he is granted pardon and released
      from the custody. It is for these reasons that clause (b)
      of S. 306(4) casts a duty on the Court to keep the
      approver under detention till the termination of the trial

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   65

      and thus the provisions are based on statutory
      principles of public policy and public interest, violation
      of which could not be tolerated. But one thing is clear
      that the release of an approver on bail may be illegal
      which can be set aside by a superior Court, but such a
      release would not have any effect on the validity of the
      pardon once validly granted to an approver. In these
      circumstances even though the approver was not
      granted any bail by the committal Magistrate or by the
      trial Judge yet his release by the High Court would not in
      any way affect the validity of the pardon granted to the
      approver Ram Sagar."

             59. It may be noticed here that the procedure to be

followed when a person is tendered pardon under Section 306

Cr.P.C. and under Section 307 Cr.P.C. are different.           Or, in

other words, two procedures are prescribed in respect of

tendering of pardon to a person. This aspect was challenged

before the courts as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution

because two different procedures are prescribed which has no

justification.    But the said challenge was repelled by the

decision reported in M. Chhagganlal v. Grater Bombay

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                     66

Municipality (AIR 1974 SC 2009), wherein it was held as

follows:

            "33. It is, therefore, clear from these decisions that
      where there are two procedures for determination and
      enforcement of a liability, be it civil or criminal or
      revenue, one of which is substantially more drastic and
      prejudicial than the other, and they operate in the same
      field, without any guiding policy or principle available
      from the legislation as to when one or the other
      procedure shall be followed the law providing for the
      more drastic and prejudicial procedure would be liable
      to be condemned as discriminatory and void. This
      principle has held that field for over twenty years and it
      is logically sound and unexceptionable. ........The
      arbitrary choice of       two alternative procedure is,
      therefore, not given to the same authority and there is
      accordingly no violation of Article 14. This contention of
      the respondents is in our opinion, having regard to the
      substance of the guarantee of equality, untenable and
      cannot be accepted. It proceeds on a misconception of
      the true principle on which this Court has struck down
      laws   providing     for   special   procedure   which    is
      substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the
      ordinary procedure. Principle as well as precedent,

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                    67

      clearly   appreciated,    would    remove    the   mist  of
      misunderstanding        surrounding      this    facet   of
      constitutional equality. The principle which emerges
      from the decisions of this Court - and we have already
      discussed some of the important decisions - is that
      where persons similarly circumstanced are exposed to
      two procedures for determination of liability, one being
      more drastic and prejudicial than the other and no
      guidelines are provided by the legislature as to when one
      procedure shall be followed or the other, so that one
      person may be subjected to the more drastic and
      prejudicial procedure while the other may be subjected
      to the more favourable one, without there being any
      valid justification for distinguishing between the two, the
      law providing for the more drastic and prejudicial
      procedure is liable to be struck down as discriminatory.
      It is not necessary, in order to incur the condemnation of
      the equality clause, that the initiation of both procedures
      should be left to the arbitrary discretion of one and the
      same authority. What the equality clause strikes at is
      discrimination, howsoever it results. It is not constricted
      by any constitutional dogma or rigid formula. There is an
      infinite variety of ways in which discrimination may
      occur. It may assume multitudinous forms. But wherever
      it is found and howsoever it arises, it is within the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  68

      inhibition of the equality clause. Where, therefore, as
      between persons similarly situated, one may be
      subjected to one procedure while another may be
      subjected to the other, without there being any rational
      basis for distinction and one procedure is substantially
      more drastic and prejudicial than the other, unjust
      discrimination would result, irrespective of whether the
      arbitrary choice of initiation of the two procedures is
      vested in the same authority or not. Indeed to the person
      subjected to the more drastic and onerous procedure it
      is immaterial whether such procedure is put into
      operation by one or the other organ or agency of the
      Government or the public authority. It is poor comfort to
      him to be told he is treated differently from others like
      him, but the differential treatment emanates from one
      organ or agency of the Government or the public
      authority as distinct from another. His rejoinder would
      immediately be that it makes no difference, because,
      whichever be the organ or agency of the Government or
      the public authority which initiates the differential
      treatment against him, it is traceable to the broad source
      of State power or power of the public authority. The
      unequal treatment by reason of the adoption of the
      substantially more drastic and onerous procedure would
      be meted out to him by the Administration in its larger

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                    69

      sense - may be legally particularised in the shape of
      different instrumentalities - and he would suffer all the
      same. We are here dealing with the common man and
      when action is initiated against him for determining his
      liability to eviction, it would be incomprehensible to him
      to make a distinction between Municipal Commissioner
      and Municipal Corporation or Collector and Government.
      It would be nothing short of hypertechnicality to say that
      action against him is initiated not by the Municipal
      Corporation or the Government but by the Municipal
      Commissioner or the Collector. The constitutionality of a
      statutory provision cannot turn on mere difference of the
      hands that harm, though both belong to the Government
      or the Municipal Corporation, for otherwise it would be
      easy to circumvent the guarantee of equality and to rob
      it of its substance by a subtle and well-manipulated
      statutory provision vesting the more drastic and
      prejudicial procedure in a different organ of the
      Government or public authority than the one in whose
      hands lies the power to initiate the ordinary procedure.
      That would be disastrous. We must look at the substance
      and not the mere form. In fact in Suraj Mull Mohta's case
      (AIR 1954 SC 545) and Shree Meenakshi Mills case (AIR
      1955 SC 13) the special procedure under the Income-tax
      Investigation Commission Act could be initiated by the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   70

      Central Government while the ordinary procedure under
      the Income-tax Act could be initiated by an altogether
      different authority, namely, the Income-tax Officer, and
      yet it was held that Section 5, sub-section (4) in one case
      and Section 5, sub-section (1) in the other were violative
      of Article 14 since the two procedures one substantially
      more drastic and prejudicial than the other, operated in
      the same field without any guidelines being provided by
      the legislature as to when one or the other shall be
      adopted. Moresoever, it is not correct to say that it is the
      Municipal Commissioner who would initiate the special
      procedure set out in Chapter VA. The Municipal
      Commissioner would be moved by the Estate Officer of
      the Municipal Corporation to issue a notice under
      Section 105-B, sub-section (2) just as a Civil Court
      would be moved by the Municipal Corporation to issue
      process against the occupant. Alternatively, the matter
      can also be viewed from a slightly different standpoint.
      When a Municipal Commissioner issues notice under
      S.105-B, sub-section (2) initiating the special procedure
      against an occupant, he really acts on behalf and for the
      benefit of the Municipal Corporation - he seeks to
      enforce    the  right  of   the   Municipal  Corporation.
      Therefore, it is really the Municipal Corporation which
      avails of the special procedure set out in Chapter VA.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  71

      The scope and content of the aforementioned rule
      against discrimination in matters of procedure cannot,
      therefore, be narrowed down or its applicability in the
      present case obviated on the ground suggested by the
      respondents."

            60. In the decision reported in Iqbal Singh v. State

(AIR 1977 SC 2437), it was held as follows:

            "Where, however, a Special Judge takes cognizance
      of the case, the occasion for examining the approver as
      a witness arises only once. It is true that in such a case
      there would be no previous evidence of the approver
      against which his evidence at the trial could be tested,
      which would have been available to the accused had the
      proceeding been initiated in the court of a Magistrate
      who under Sub-sec. (2-B) of S. 337 of the Code is
      required to send the case for trial to the Special Judge
      after examining the approver. But we do not find
      anything in Sub-sec. (2-B) of S. 337 to suggest that it
      affects in any way the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to
      take cognizance of an offence without the accused being
      committed to him for trial. Sub-section (2-B) was
      inserted in S. 337 in 1955 by Amendment Act 26 of
      1955. If by enacting Sub-sec. (2-B) in 1955 the
      legislature sought to curb the power given to the Special

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                    72

      Judge by S. 8 (1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,
      1952, there is no reason why the legislature should not
      have expressed its intention clearly. Also, the fact that
      the approver's evidence cannot be tested against any
      previous statement does not seem to us to make any
      material difference to the detriment of the accused
      transgressing Article 14 of the Constitution. The Special
      Judge in any case will have to apply the well established
      tests for the appreciation of the accomplice's evidence.
      This Court in Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. v. Municipal
      Corporation of Greater Bombay, (AIR 1974 SC 2009) held
      that the mere availability of two procedures would not
      justify the quashing of a provision as being violative of
      Article 14 and that "what is necessary to attract the
      inhibition of the Article is that there must be substantial
      and qualitative differences between the two procedures
      so that one is really and substantially more drastic and
      prejudicial than the other. ......" In our opinion there is
      no such qualitative difference in the two procedures
      whether a witness is examined once or twice does not in
      our opinion make any such substantial difference viz.
      that one of them could be described as more drastic
      than the other. The appeal is accordingly dismissed."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  73

            61. In the decision reported in Anil Kumar v. State

of Kerala (1996(1)K.L.T. 147), it was held as follows:

            "37. With regard to the Court of Sessions, the
      power to grant pardon and the procedure for the same is
      prescribed under Section 307 Cr. P.C. which reads as
      follows:
            "307. At any time after commitment of a case but
      before judgment is passed, the court to which the
      commitment is made may, with a view to obtaining at
      the trail the evidence of any person supposed to have
      been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, any
      such offence, tender a pardon on the same condition to
      such person."
      The condition is not mentioned in Section 307 Cr. P.C.,
      but mentioned only in Section 306 (1) of Cr. P.C. The
      only condition which is contained in the said Section is
      that "the person to whom pardon is granted should
      make a full and true disclosure of the circumstances
      within his knowledge relative to the offence and to every
      other person concerned, whether as principal or abettor,
      in the commission thereof. Recording a statement under
      Section 164 is not a "condition' for granting pardon.
            38. The argument of counsel for the appellants is
      based on the provisions of Section 308 (2) Cr. P.C. which

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  74

      states that any person accepting the tender of pardon
      and recording by a Magistrate under Section 164 or by a
      Court under sub-section (4) of Section 306 may be given
      in evidence against him at such trial. The trial which is
      dealt with in this section is prosecuting the accused to
      whom conditional pardon is granted for wilfully
      concealing anything essential or for giving false
      evidence. This argument also is far-fetched as the
      wording in sub-section (2) of Section 308 Cr. P. C. is
      very clear which obliges the Magistrate alone to record a
      statement under Section 164 and such an obligation is
      not there for the Court of Sessions. The Code has made
      a distinction between the Magistrate and the Court of
      Sessions for obvious reasons. If the Code does not
      enjoin a duty on the Court of Sessions to examine the
      first accused under Section 164 Cr. P.C., the argument
      that as he was not examined under Section 164 Cr. P .C.,
      he should not have been treated as an approver and
      ought not have been examined as a witness cannot be
      accepted.
            39. We gain support to the proposition stated
      above from the decision of the Orissa High Court in
      State v. Bigyan Ma//ik (1975 Crl. L. J. 1937). The Orissa
      High Court held that the phrase 'same condition' in
      Section 307 Cr. P. C. obviously makes a reference to

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  75

      Section 306 (1) under which the Magistrate may tender
      pardon to the person supposed to have been concerned
      in an offence on condition of his making a full and true
      disclosure. The requirement of Section 306(4)(a) that the
      person accepting a tender of pardon has to be examined
      as a witness in the Court of the Magistrate and in the
      subsequent trial, if any, is not a condition subject to
      which pardon is granted. When pardon has been granted
      by the Sessions Judge under Section 307, it is not
      necessary to comply with the requirement of Section 306
      (4) in so far as it requires that the person to whom
      pardon has been tendered should be examined as a
      witness in the Court of the Magistrate taking cognizance
      of the offence and also in the subsequent trial, if any. It
      also held that examination of a person to whom pardon
      is tendered is not a condition of the tender of pardon.
      Therefore, it cannot be held that when for the first time
      at the Sessions stage pardon is tendered, the committal
      becomes vitiated and must betaken afresh in order that
      the requirement of sub-section (4) (1 )(a) of Section 306
      Cr. P.C. may be complied with. We are in perfect
      agreement with the decision of the Orissa High Court.
      So, it follows that the argument of counsel for the
      appellants has no legs to stand on and it is only to be
      rejected. We hold that there is no irregularity or illegality

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  76

      committed by the Court of Sessions in not examining the
      first accused before he was examined as P.W.3. We also
      note that the power of recording a statement under
      Section 164 Cr. P. C. is given to the Magistrate and not
      to a Court of Sessions."



            62.     Going by the decisions which seek aid of

Section 482 Cr.P.C. to sustain the constitutionality of Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., it could be seen that in all those cases bail

was granted after the approver had been examined during

trial. The question posed in these cases is whether pending

trial such person can be released from custody.

            63.    At this point of time, one may refer to the

contentions      raised   by    the   learned    Senior    Counsel

Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan on behalf of the petitioners.          It is

contended by the learned Senior Counsel that the word 'shall'

appearing in Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. need not be considered

as mandatory and is not intended to be treated as mandatory,

but it is only directory in nature. It is well settled that merely

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 77

because the word 'shall' is used or that the section is

negatively worded by themselves are not grounds to hold that

the provision is mandatory.

             64.     In the decision reported in Collector of

Monghyr v. Keshav Prasad (AIR 1962 SC 1694), it was held as

follows:

             "12. We feel unable to accept the submission of
      learned Counsel that in the context in which the words
      ''for the reasons to be recorded by him" occur in S. 5A
      and considering the scheme of Ch. II of the Act, the
      requirement of these words could be held to be
      otherwise than mandatory. It is needless to add that the
      employment of the auxiliary verb "shall" is inconclusive
      and similarly the mere absence of the imperative is not
      conclusive either. The question whether any requirement
      is mandatory or directory has to be decided not merely
      on the basic of any specific provision which, for
      instance, sets out the consequences of the omission to
      observe the requirement, but on the purpose for which
      the requirement has been enacted, particularly in the
      context of the other provisions of the Act and the
      general scheme thereof. It would, inter alia, depend on
      whether the requirement is insisted on as a protection

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 78

      for the safeguarding of the right of liberty of person or
      of property which the action might involve."

            65. In the decision reported in M/s. Rubber House

v. M/s. Excelsior Needle Industries Pvt. Ltd. (1989) 2 SCC 413,

it was held as follows:

            "31. The word "shall" in its ordinary import is
      obligatory. Nevertheless, the word "shall" need not be
      given that connotation in each and every case and the
      provisions can be interpreted as directory instead of
      mandatory depending upon the purpose which the
      legislature intended to achieve as disclosed by the
      object, design, purpose and scope of the statute. While
      interpreting the concerned provisions, regard must be
      had to the context, subject matter and object of the
      statute in question."

            66. In the decision reported in State of Punjab v.

Shamlal Murai (AIR 1976 SC 1177), it was held as follows:

            "7. It is true that, in form, the rule strikes a
      mandatory note and, in design, is intended to facilitate a
      plurality of judges hearing the appeal, each equipped
      with a set of relevant papers. May be, there is force in
      the view taken by the Full Bench that certain basic

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   79

      records must be before the Court along with the appeal
      if the Court is to function satisfactorily in the exercise of
      its appellate power. In this sense, the needs of the rule
      transcend the directory level and may, perhaps, be
      considered a mandatory need. The use of 'shall' - a word
      of slippery semantics - in a rule is not decisive and the
      context of the statute, the purpose of the prescription,
      the public injury in the event of neglect of the rule and
      the conspectus of circumstances bearing on the
      importance of the condition, have all to be considered
      before condemning a violation as fatal.
            8. It is obvious that even taking a stern view, every
      minor detail in Rule 3 cannot carry a compulsory or
      imperative import. After all, what is required for the
      Judges to dispose of the appeal is the memorandum of
      appeal plus the judgment and the paper book. Three
      copies would certainly be a great advantage, but what is
      the core of the matter is not the number but the
      presence, and the over-emphasis laid by the Court on
      three copies is, we think, mistaken. Perhaps, the rule
      requires three copies and failure to comply therewith
      may be an irregularity. Had no copy been furnished of
      any one of the three items, the result might have been
      different. In the present case, copies of all the three
      documents prescribed, have been furnished but not

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 80

      three copies of each. This omission or default is only a
      breach which can be characterised as an irregularity to
      be corrected by condonation on application by the party
      fulfilling the condition within a time allowed by the
      Court. We must always remember that processual law is
      not to be a tyrant but a servant, not an obstruction but
      an aid to justice. It has been wisely observed that
      procedural prescriptions are the hand-maid and not the
      mistress,    a  lubricant,  not  a   resistant   in  the
      administration of justice. Where the non-compliance,
      tho' procedural, will thwart fair hearing or prejudice
      doing of justice to parties, the rule is mandatory. But,
      grammar apart, if the breach can be corrected without
      injury to a just disposal of the case, we should not
      enthrone a regulatory requirement into a dominant
      desideratum. After all, Courts are to do justice, not to
      wreck this end product on technicalities. Viewed in this
      perspective, even what is regarded as mandatory
      traditionally may, perhaps, have to be moderated into
      wholesome directions to be complied with in time or in
      extended time. Be that as it may, and ignoring for a
      moment the exploration of the true office of procedural
      conditions, we have no doubt that what is of the essence
      of Rule 3 is not that three copies should be furnished,
      but that copies of all the three important documents

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   81

      referred to in that rule shall be produced. We further feel
      that the Court should, if it thinks it necessitous, exercise
      its discretion and grant further time for formal
      compliance with the rule if the copies fall short of the
      requisite number. In this view and to the extent
      indicated,we overrule the decision in Bikram Dass's case
      AIR 1975 Punj and Har 1 (FB)."

            67.    In the decision reported in Narayana Rao v.

State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1952 SC 737), it was held as

follows:

            "10. It will, thus, appear that in cases exclusively
      triable by a Court of Session, it is the duty of the
      Magistrate while holding a preliminary inquiry, to satisfy
      himself that the documents referred in S. 173 have been
      furnished to the accused and if he found that the police
      officer concerned had not carried out his duty in that
      behalf, the Magistrate should see to it that that is done.
            After the accused have been furnished with the
      necessary documents, it is now required to record
      evidence of only such witnesses for the prosecution as
      had witnessed the actual commission of the offence
      charged against the accused and of such other witnesses
      as he may consider necessary in the interests of justice.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  82

      From what has been said above, it is clear that the
      Munsiff-Magistrate did record the evidence as required
      by sub-s. (4) of S.207-A.
             But it has been found by the High Court on the
      admission of the Government Advocate, that the
      provisions of sub-s. (3) of S. 207-A, had not been
      complied with. It is not clear as to whether all the
      documents contemplated by S.173 (4), quoted above,
      had not been furnished to the accused or documents
      other than the statements of witnesses had not been so
      supplied. The judgment of the High Court, would appear
      to indicate the latter, but we shall proceed on the
      assumption that there was an entire omission to carry
      out the provisions of sub-s. (4) of S. 173, read with sub-
      s. (3) of S. 207-A.
             Does such an omission necessarily render the
      entire proceedings and the trial null and void; or is it
      only an irregularity curable with reference to the
      provisions of S. 537 (a) of the Code?In other words, are
      the provisions of S. 173 (4), read with S. 207-A (3)
      mandatory or only directory? There is no doubt that
      those provisions have been introduced by the amending
      Act of 1955, in order to simplify the procedure in
      respect of inquiries leading upto a Sessions trial, and at
      the same time, to safeguard the interests of accused

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   83

      persons by enjoining upon police officers concerned and
      Magistrates before whom such proceedings are brought,
      to see that all the documents, necessary to give the
      accused persons all the information for the proper
      conduct of their defence, are furnished.
            It has rightly been contended on behalf of the
      appellant that it was the duty of the Magistrate to see
      that the provisions aforesaid of the Code, have been
      fully complied with. Magistrates, therefore, have to be
      circumspect, while conducting such proceedings, to see
      to it that accused persons are not handicapped in their
      defence by any omission on the part of police officers
      concerned, to supply the necessary copies.
            But    we   are    not  prepared   to   hold  that
      noncompliance with those provisions has, necessarily,
      the result of vitiating those proceedings and subsequent
      trial. The word "shall" occurring both in sub-s. (4) of
      S.173 and sub-s. (3) of S.207-A, is not mandatory but
      only directory, because an omission by a police officer,
      to fully comply with the provisions of S.173, should not
      be allowed to have such a far-reaching effect as to
      render the proceedings including the trial before the
      Court of Session, wholly ineffective.
            Instead of simplifying the procedure, as was
      intended by the amending Act, as indicated above, the

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   84

      result contended for on behalf of the appellant, will,
      necessarily, result in re-opening the proceedings and
      trials which may have been concluded long ago. Such a
      result will be neither conducive to expeditious justice
      nor in the interest of accused persons themselves.
            Certainly, if it is Shown, in a particular case, on
      behalf of the accused persons that the omission on the
      part of the police officers concerned or of the Magistrate
      before whom the committal proceedings had pended,
      has caused prejudice to the accused, in the interest of
      justice, the Court may re-open the proceedings by
      insisting upon full compliance with the provisions of the
      Code.
            In our opinion, the omission complained of in the
      instant case, should not have a more far-reaching effect
      than the omission to carry out the provisions of S. 162
      or S. 360 of the Code. Courts in India, before such
      matters were taken to their Lordships of the Judicial
      Committee of the Privy Council, had taken conflicting
      views on the scope of S. 537 of the Code in curing such
      omissions as aforesaid.


            In the case of Abdul Rahman v. Emperor, 54 Ind
      App 96 : (A I R 1927 P C 44) (A), their Lordships of the
      Judicial Committee, had to consider the effect of non-

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  85

      compliance with the provisions of S. 360 of the Code.
      After considering the relevant provisions of the Code,
      their Lordships came to the conclusion that it was a
      mere irregularity which could be cured by the provisions
      of S. 537. In the case of Pulukuri Kotayya v. Emperor, 74
      Ind App 65: (A I R 1947 P C 67) (B), the Judicial
      Committee had to consider the effect of breach of the
      statutory provisions of S. 162 of the Code. The following
      observations of their Lordships, at pp. 75 -76 (of Ind
      App): (at pp.69-70 of A I R) are a complete answer to the
      arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant before
      us, and we respectfully adopt them:
            "When a trial is conducted in a manner different
      from that prescribed by the Code (as in Subramanya Iyer
      v. Emperor, 28 Ind App 257 (PC) (C), the trail is bad and
      question of curing an irregularity arises; but if the trail is
      conducted substantially in the manner prescribed by the
      code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such
      conduct, the irregularity can be cured under S.537, and
      none the less so because the irregularity involves, as
      must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more
      of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code. The
      distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between
      an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather
      than of kind. This view finds support in the decision of

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  86

      their Lordships' Board in 54 Ind App 96: (A I R 1927 P C
      44) (A), where failure to comply with S.360, Criminal P.C.
      was held to be cured by Ss.535 and 537. The present
      case falls under S. 537, and their Lordships hold the trial
      valid notwithstanding the breach of S. 162."

            68. In the decision reported in Central Bureau of

Investigation v. R.S. Pai (2002(2) K.L.T. 149), it was held as

follows:



            "7. From the aforesaid sub-sections, it is apparent
      that normally the investigating officer is required to
      produce all the relevant documents at the time of
      submitting the charge-sheet. At the same time, as there
      is no specific prohibition, it cannot be held that the
      additional documents cannot be produced subsequently.
      If some mistake is committed in not producing the
      relevant documents at the time of submitting the report
      of chargesheet, it is always open to the investigation
      officer to produce the same with the permission of the
      Court. In our view, considering the preliminary stage of
      prosecution and the context in which police officer is
      required to forward to the Magistrate, all the documents
      or the relevant extracts thereof on which prosecution

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   87

      proposes to rely, the word 'shall' used in sub-s. (5)
      cannot be interpreted as mandatory but as directory.
      Normally,     the  documents      gathered   during    the
      investigation upon which the prosecution wants to rely
      are required to be forwarded to the Magistrate but if
      there is some omission, it would not mean that the
      remaining documents cannot be produced subsequently.
      Analogous provision under S. 173(4) of the Code of
      Criminal Procedure, 1898 was considered by this Court
      in Narayan Rao v. The State of Andhra Pradesh (1958
      SCR 283 at 293) and it was held that the word 'shall'
      occurring in sub-s. 4 of S.173 and sub-s. 3 of S. 207A is
      not mandatory but only directory. Further, the scheme
      of sub-s. (8) of S.173 also makes it abundantly clear
      that even after the charge-sheet is submitted, further
      investigation, if called for, is not precluded. If further
      investigation is not precluded then there is no question
      of not permitting the prosecution to produce additional
      documents which were gathered prior to or subsequent
      to investigation.   In such cases, there cannot be any
      prejudice to the accused. Hence, the impugned order
      passed by the Special Court cannot be sustained."

            69. In the decision reported in Devinder Singh v.

State of Punjab (AIR 2008 SC 261), it was held as follows:

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   88

            "43. Rule 4 of the Rules employs the word 'shall'
      not once place but twice. Ordinarily, it is imperative in
      character. No reason has been shown before us as to
      why it should be held to be directory provision
      particularly when the Land Acquisition Act is an
      expropriatory legislation."

            70. In the decision reported in M/s. R.N.Jadi and

Brothers v. Subhashechandra (AIR 2007 SC 2571), it was held

as follows:

            "14. It is also to be noted that though the power of
      the Court under the proviso appended to Rule 1 of Order
      VIII is circumscribed by the words - shall not be later
      than ninety days" but the consequences flowing from
      non-extension of time are not specifically provided
      though they may be read by necessary implication.
      Merely, because a provision of law is couched in a
      negative language implying mandatory character, the
      same is not without exceptions. The courts, when called
      upon to interpret the nature of the provision, may,
      keeping in view the entire context in which the provision
      came to be enacted, hold the same to be directory
      though worded in the negative form."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  89




            71. In the decision reported in Vidyawati Gupta v.

Bhakti Hari Nayak (AIR 2006 SC 1194), it was held as follows:

            "50. The intention of the legislature in bringing
      about the various amendments in the Code with effect
      from 1st July, 2002 were aimed at eliminating the
      procedural delays in the disposal of civil matters. The
      amendments effected to Section 26, Order IV and Order
      VI Rule 15, are also geared to achieve such object, but
      being procedural in nature, they are directory in nature
      and non-compliance thereof would not automatically
      render the plaint non-est, as has been held by the
      Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court."

            72. In the decision reported in Ram Deen Maurya

(Dr.) v. State of U.P. ((2009) 6 SCC 735), it was held as follows:

            "It is true, in Rule 4(6) of the Rules, the
      rule-making authority has used the expression "shall"
      and the word "shall" in its ordinary import is obligatory.
      Nevertheless, the word "shall" need not be interpreted as
      directory instead of mandatory depending upon the
      purpose which the legislature intended to achieve as
      disclosed by the object, design, purpose and scope of
      the statute. While interpreting the provisions concerned,

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  90

      regard must be hand to the content, subject-matter and
      object of the statute in question."

            73.    In the light of the fact that the prohibition

under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. does not appear in Section 307

Cr.P.C., a question may arise whether it is possible for the

court to which the case is committed and which tenders

pardon to a person is competent and is empowered to release

such a person from custody. Though the question in a way

came up for consideration in the decision reported in Shammi

Firoz v. National Investigation Agency (2010 (4) K.L.T. 409),

this court chose to take recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C. to

grant relief to the petitioner.

            74. So far as the decision in Smithlal v. State of

Kerala (2012(4) K.L.T. 807) is concerned, that decision was

rendered in an application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. and not

under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and the decision was rendered in

that context even though a sweeping observation has been

made that in view of the specific bar under Section 306(4)(b)

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 91

Cr.P.C., Section 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked. No specific

issue as to the applicability of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

was agitated in that case and the court had no opportunity to

consider the issue from that angle. Therefore, that decision

cannot be taken as laying down the principle that in view of

the bar under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., there is a total

prohibition and that Section 482 Cr.P.C. cannot come to the

aid of the person concerned.

            75.    As rightly pointed out by the learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioners, once pardon is tendered to an

accused, or a person contemplated under Section 306 or

Section 307 Cr.P.C., then he loses his character as an accused

and adorns the status of a witness. Except for the prohibition

under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., it may not be possible

to      detain       that    person     under     the    Code.

Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan, learned Senior Counsel, seems to be

justified in his submission that but for the bar under Section

306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., the person concerned could not have been

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                92

detained in custody.     The further contention that it is not

intended to curtail the liberty of the person, but intended to

provide protection in deserving cases and also to ensure that

the accused person do not take undue advantage of the

position appears to be quite sound and reasonable.            The

submission         of   the      learned     Senior       Counsel

Shri.O.V.Radhakrishnan that it is not always necessary in all

cases that when a person is tendered pardon under Section

306 Cr.P.C., he should be detained without anything more is

not the intention of the legislature also seems to be correct.

Only in cases where the situation demands or the court feels

that it is necessary to detain the person for justifiable reasons,

the provision can be invoked. That seems to be the proper

way to understand the provision. It must be remembered that

as far as the reasons for detaining a person under Section 306

(4)(b) Cr.P.C. are concerned, it is equally     applicable to a

person to whom pardon is tendered under Section 307 Cr.P.C.

also. So also, the same conditions apply to a person to whom

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                93

pardon is tendered under Section 306 Cr.P.C. and who is

already on bail.     The legislature must be credited with the

knowledge of these facts and in that context and under such

circumstances the provision, namely, Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

will have to be understood. If a person who is already on bail

could continue on bail when pardon is tendered to him under

Section 306 or 307 Cr.P.C., then it defies one's logic why a

restriction as in the nature of Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. should

be imposed in the case of a person who is unfortunate to be

not on bail when pardon is tendered to him. An anomalous

situation may arise if one is to simply accept the proposition

that a person in custody should continue to be in custody till

the end of the trial adopting a strict interpretation of the

provision.    For example,    in a case there may be distinct

incidents. It may so happen when some of the accused might

have been granted bail and some might not have been

granted bail. It may also happen that even though an accused

is granted bail, he is not able to execute the bond and

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               94

therefore he has to remain in custody. If in such a case, for

one portion of the incident, a person is granted pardon and if

he is already on bail, he can continue to be on bail. If for

another incident forming part of the same transaction, a

person who is in custody is granted pardon, to say that he

should languish in custody till the end of the trial seems to be

unjustified, unreasonable and arbitrary and against the

notions of justice.

            76. The provision, namely, Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

cannot be taken as one curtailing the liberty and freedom of a

person, but should be treated as an enabling and empowering

provision which the courts concerned can take aid of in a case

where circumstances warrant a situation to detain a person

who has been granted pardon in further custody if he is not

already on bail. It is difficult to comprehend that without

anything more, the mere fact that the person who is tendered

pardon who is not on bail should continue in custody for no

justifiable reason.

            77.     It is well settled by now that there is no

universal principle to determine while construing a statute as

to if it is directory or mandatory. The burden is on the courts

to ascertain the real intention of the provision and for that

purpose, the statute has to be construed as a whole. Several

factors may have to be considered            to determine the real

character and nature of the Statute. There can be no doubt

that the absolute enactment must be literally obeyed and

fulfilled. Normally, a statute is considered to be mandatory if

it imposes conditions, and its satisfaction is essential for the

validity of the Act.

            78.     N.S.Bindra's    in his work 'Interpretation of

Statutes', 10th Edition, Reprint 2012, at page 984, observed as

follows:



            "The classification of statutes as mandatory and
       directory is useful in analysing and solving the problem
       of what effect should be given to their directions. But it
       must be kept in mind in what sense the terms are used,

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   96

      that they are only descriptive of the effect that, as it has
      been determined, should be given to the statutory
      provision, and that there is no essential difference in
      statutes    whereby    their  mandatory     and   directory
      character can be determined as a means by the
      legislature to be regarded; but where the consequences
      of not obeying       them in every particular are not
      prescribed, the courts must judicially determine them.
      In doing so they must necessarily consider the
      importance of the literal and punctilious observance of
      the provision in question to the object the legislature
      had in view.    If it is essential, it is mandatory and a
      departure from it is fatal to any proceeding to execute
      the statute or to obtain the benefit of it."

At page 988, it is mentioned as follows:

            "So a mandatory      statute according to Crawfod,
      may    be   defined      as  one    whose   provisions    or
      requirements, if not complied with, will render the
      proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, while a
      directory statute is one where non-compliance will not
      invalidate the proceedings to which it relates."

                                   97

            79. Maxwell on 'Interpretation of Statutes' at page

373 observes as follows:

            "It has been said that no rule can be laid down for
      determining whether the command is to be considered
      as a mere direction or instruction involving no
      invalidating   consequence    in  its disregard,   or   as
      imperative,     with    an   implied   nullification   for
      disobedience, beyond the fundamental one that it
      depends on the scope and object of the enactment. It
      may, perhaps, be found generally correct to say that
      nullification is the natural and usual consequence of
      disobedience, but the question is in the main governed
      by considerations of convenience and justice, and, when
      that result would involve general inconvenience         or
      injustice to innocent persons, or advantage to those
      guilty of the neglect, without promoting the real aim and
      object of the enactment, such an intention is not to be
      attributed to the Legislature.    The whole scope and
      purpose of the statute under consideration must be
      regarded.      The general rule is, that an absolute
      enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, but it is
      sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or fulfilled
      substantially."

The above passages, taken along with the decisions referred

to above, would show that merely because the word 'shall' is

used in a Statute, it is not obligatory for the court to treat it as

mandatory. Several factors as already noticed and as could be

observed from the decisions and passages referred to above

will have to be considered before reaching a conclusion

whether strict compliance is necessary.

            80     It must be noticed that outlook of court

regarding the scope and ambit of Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.

has undergone considerable change. Initially the courts were

very reluctant to delete the rigor of the Section and it was

construed to be absolute in its terms. With the passage of

time and developments in constitutional law, the courts began

to adopt a moderate approach and invoked the inherent power

under Section 482 to save Section 306(4)(b) from the vice of

constitutional attack.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               99

            81. If one is to go by the object and purpose of

Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C., as already noticed, it is difficult to

come to the conclusion that it casts an absolute prohibition or

absolute bar on the court to release the person who has been

tendered pardon from detention merely because he has not

been fortunate enough to go on bail.

            82. There may be some doubt regarding the actual

character of the person who is tendered pardon. Of course,

the moment he is tendered pardon, he transforms into the

position of a witness.      But it is difficult to say that he

altogether sheds      the character of an accused.   It will be

appropriate to understand the position that the status of an

accused, who is tendered pardon, his position as an accused

remains under an eclipse as long as he adorns the character of

a witness and satisfies the conditions of pardon. Once he fails

to do so under Section 306 Cr.P.C., his status as an accused

person revives and subsequent events follow.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                100

            83.    Two questions then arise for consideration.

They are (i) if it is to be held that Section 306 (4)(b) Cr.P.C. is

not mandatory and is only directory, can the court concerned

grant bail? and (ii) even if it is considered to be mandatory,

has it overriding power over Section 482 Cr.P.C.?

            84. As far as the first question is concerned, grant

of bail is only under Sections 436, 437 and 439 Cr.P.C.

Section 436 Cr.P.C. relates to bailable offence. Section 437

Cr.P.C. deals with grant of bail to a person accused of, or

suspected of the commission of any non-bailable offence who

is arrested or detained without warrant. Section 439 Cr.P.C.

deals with a person accused of an offence and is in custody. A

reading of the above provisions will leave one in no doubt that

it relates to an accused person in custody. It has already been

noticed that once pardon is tendered to a person, he ceases to

be an accused and occupies the status of a witness and

Sections 437 and 439 Cr.P.C. may not be available. Therefore,

under Section 437 Cr.P.C., even though there is no such

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                 101

prohibition as contained in Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. is

available, still it may not be possible for the committing court

to release the petitioner from custody          since Section 439

Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked in such cases.

            85. This leads us to the second question whether

the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. can be invoked. True,

normally, it is stated that if there is a specific prohibition

under the Code, the inherent power cannot be invoked to

override the specific prohibition. But the object and purpose

of Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. has already been noticed.

            86.    Woodroffe in his 'Commentaries on Code of

Criminal Procedure', 3rd Edition, Vol.2 at page 1220 observed

as follows:

            "The discretionary powers of the High Court to
      grant bail to approvers cannot but be sparingly
      exercised. Approvers should, as far as possible, be kept
      out of temptation either of absconding or of being
      induced to resile from their admission.      Though by
      admission of their guilt they escape punishment it is not

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                102

      unbearable hardship on them if they are detained in
      custody pending the trial of their co-accomplices.
      Where a prisoner made a statement on a promise of
      pardon and then without fulfilling the conditions of
      promise of pardon absconded so that no pardon was
      ever granted, his statement could not be used as
      evidence against him in his subsequent capture and
      trial."

The scope of the power available under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,

has been considered in a number of decisions. Before going

into the decisions, it may be useful to refer to Section 482. It

reads as follows:



      "482.     Saving of inherent power of High Court.-
      Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect
      the inherent powers of the High Court to make such
      orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order
      this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice."

             87. It is well settled by now that Section 482 of

Cr.P.C. does not confer any new power on the court. It only

declares the power which already existed in the Code. The

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  103

declaration was necessary to dispel any doubt that apart from

the powers enumerated in the Code the courts enjoyed no

other power. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in fact only recognizes

inherent power in every court to exercise its powers to do

justice. The exercise of power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is

contemplated under three circumstances. They are,

            (i) to give effect to an order under the Code,

            (ii) to prevent abuse of process of court,

            (iii) to secure the ends of justice.

Among the above three, (ii) and (iii) work in both ways. Those

powers are exercised either to prevent injustice being done to

a party as well as ensuring that a just cause is not thrown out

unjustly and that grievance of a person does not go

unredressed.

            88.    One may now refer to the decisions in this

regard. In the decision reported in Dinesh Dutt Joshi v. State

of Rajasthan (2001) 8 SCC 570, it was held as follows:

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   104

            "4. Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
      confers upon the High Court inherent powers to make
      such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any
      order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the
      process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of
      justice. It is well established principle of law that every
      court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae - to
      do that real and substantialjustice for the administration
      of which alone it exists or to prevent abuse of the
      process of the court. The principle embodied in section
      is  based    upon    the   maxim:   quando     lex  aliquid
      alicuiconcedit, conceder videtur id quo resipsaesse non
      potest ie. When the law gives anything to anyone, it
      gives also all those things without which the thing itself
      would be unavailable. Section does not confer any new
      power, but only declares that the High Court possesses
      inherent powers for the purposes specified in the
      section. As lacunae are sometimes found in procedural
      law, the section has been embodied to cover such
      lacunae wherever they are discovered.          The use of
      extraordinary powers conferred upon the High Cxourt
      under this section are however required to be reserved,
      as far as possible for extraordinary cases."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  105

            89. In the decision reported in Jeffrey J. Diermeier

v. State of West Bengal (2010) 6 SCC 243), it was held as

follows:

            "8. Before addressing the contentions     advanced
      on behalf of the parties, it will be useful to notice the
      scope and ambit of inherent powers of the High Court
      under Section 482 of the Code.         The section itself
      envisages three circumstances under which the inherent
      jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (1) to give effect
      to an order under the Code; (ii) to prevent abuse of
      process of Court; and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends
      of justice.    Nevertheless, it is neither possible nor
      desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would
      govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction of the Court.
      Undoubtedly, the power possessed by the High Court
      under the said provision is very wide but is not
      unlimited. It has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and
      cautiously, ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial
      justice for which alone the court exists. It needs little
      emphasis that the inherent jurisdiction does not confer
      an arbitrary power on the High Court to act according to
      whim or caprice. The power exists to prevent abuse of
      authority and not to produce injustice."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  106

            90. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) K.L.T. 108), it was held as follows:

            "57. The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on   the  facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  107

      have    serious  impact   on    society.  Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
      category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                   108

      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




            91. Following the principle laid down in the above

decisions and the scope and ambit of the power available

under Section 482 Cr.P.C., it cannot be said that the so-called

prohibition under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. is a fetter on the

power of the court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to render justice

to the parties and to do such acts as are necessary to secure

the ends of justice.           The said provision is sufficient, in

appropriate cases, for the courts to grant such relief as the

situation warrants.       If that be so, when it is found by the

superior court that the continued detention of a person who

has been tendered pardon by virtue of               Section 306(4)(b)

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                  109

Cr.P.C. is unnecessary, nothing fetters            the court from

releasing such a person from detention or custody as the case

may be to ensure that his personal liberty is not affected nor

is he being detained unnecessarily and unjustifiably.

             92. It will be only appropriate to refer to the report

of the 48th Law Commission in this regard. In AIR Manual Civil

and Criminal, 6th Edition, Volume 18, Manohar and Chitaley at

page     235 reference is made to the 48th Law Commission

Report and the relevant portion is at page 238, which reads as

follows:



             "24.21. Under sub-section (3), an approver, unless
      he is already on bail, has to be detained in custody until
      the termination of the trial.   The trying Magistrate or
      Sessions Court has no power to release the approver on
      bail. Though this may seem harsh particularly when the
      trial is prolonged, we do not think the provision should
      be changed.     In extraordinary cases of hardship, the
      approver can approach the High Court whose powers as
      to bail are very wide."

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                110

            93.     The above passage gives an insight into

understanding the scope and power of Section 482 Cr.P.C..

Therefore, the contention raised by the learned Addl.D.G.P.

that in view of the bar under Section 306(4)(b) of Cr.P.C., the

powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked cannot

stand scrutiny.      If the inherent power under Section 482

Cr.P.C. could be made use of to do justice in appropriate

cases,    then     it  becomes   necessary  to   consider   the

constitutional validity of Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. and as has

been done in several decisions already referred to.

            94. Before summarizing the findings, it will be only

appropriate and infact necessary to refer to a particular aspect

projected by the Amicus Curie Shri. Sunny Mathew. Learned

counsel pointed out that the threat infact to the witness does

not cease with the giving of evidence and it continues even

thereafter. Referring to the law in various countries like USA,

Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Croatia and Thailand,

learned counsel contended that all those countries have an

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                               111

enactment for the protection of witnesses. Unfortunately in

our country, we do not have one of that sort. It is understood

that the Law Commission of India as early as in 1996 pointed

out the necessity for a comprehensive legislation in this

regard. But things remain as such. However, Section 17 of the

National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 and Section 44 of the

Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 takes note of this

aspect and provides protection to witnesses to some extent.

That is of some solace.



            The position can be summarised as follows:

      (i) Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. is an enabling provision
      which empowers the authorities concerned to detain
      a person who has been tendered pardon.



      (ii) The authorities mentioned in Section 306 Cr.P.C.
      are precluded from releasing the person who has
      been tendered pardon from custody.

B.A.7783 & 8607/2012.
                                112

      (iii)  The embargo under Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C.
      cannot be imported into Section 307 Cr.P.C.



      (iv)    In view of the fact that a person tendered
      pardon stands discharged and occupies the status of
      a witness,     Sections 437 and 439 Cr.P.C. are not
      available to release him from custody.



      (v) Section 306(4)(b) Cr.P.C. cannot be taken as an
      absolute prohibition or fetter on the inherent power
      of the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. in
      appropriate cases to release the approver from

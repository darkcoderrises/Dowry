           The petitioners were accused Nos.2 to 4 in Crime

No.353/2014 of Adhur Police Station, Kasaragod District. They

approached this Court for granting pre-arrest bail filed under

Sec.438 of Cr.P.C.    The above mentioned crime was registered

alleging the offences punishable under Secs. 323, 498(A), 403

and 506(ii) of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegations raised in the aforementioned crime are

that the 1st accused married the de facto complainant on

14-1-2010 and at the time of marriage, she was gifted with 30

sovereigns of gold ornaments and an amount of  3,00,000/-.

Thereafter, the accused used to physically and mentally harass

the de facto complainant demanding a further sum of 2,00,000/-

as dowry and thereby the accused committed the above said

offences in the above referred crime.

     3. Sri. T. Madhu, the learned counsel for the petitioners

submits that the petitioners are totally innocent of the

allegations leveled against them and they are falsely implicated

in the offences.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the

investigation is almost over and that if this court is inclined to

grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners,          the same should be

conditioned with necessary safeguards to protect the interest of

the prosecution.

      5.   Having considered the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and

taking into account the totality of the facts and circumstances

of the case, this Court is inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the

petitioners.   Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of the

arrest of the petitioners in connection with Crime No.353 of 2014

of Adhur Police Station, Kasaragod District, they shall be released

amount to the satisfaction of the investigating officer in the

aforementioned crime, and subject to the following conditions:



             i)  The petitioner shall surrender his passport, if
                 any,    before the jurisdictional Magistrate

                 execution of the bail bond before the
                 Investigating Officer and if he is not a holder
                 of passport, he shall file an affidavit to that
                 effect in the said court.    If the petitioner
                 requires his passport in connection with his

                  travel abroad, then he shall approach the
                  court concerned for the release of the same
                  and for necessary permission in that regard.
                  In case such an application is filed, the trial
                  court   or    the   jurisdictional  Magistrate
                  concerned, as the case may be, is free to
                  consider the same on merits and to pass
                  appropriate orders thereon, taking necessary
                  guidance from the principles laid down in the
                  decision of this Court in the case Asok

             iii) The petitioner shall not involve in any
                  criminal offence of similar nature.

             iv)  The   petitioner   shall  not   influence  the

                  him.



           If there is any violation of any of the aforementioned

                 ---------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C. No. 3443 OF 2013
                 ---------------------------------------
              Dated this the 16th day of August, 2013.


                              O R D E R


           The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioner,

who is an accused in Crime No.458/2011 in C.C.No 278/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -II, Kollam which is a case

instituted upon the police report [in Crime No.458/2011 of Eravipuram

Police   Station]   for  the   offences   punishable    under   Sections

341,323,324,326,294(b) and 427 read with 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to call for the records leading to Annexure-A1 Final Report in Crime

No.458/2011     of  Eravipuram    Police  Station,   pending  as   C  C

No.278/2012 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam

and to quash the same, as against the petitioner, as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.   The prosecution case is that on 23.04.2011, the accused

persons along with two other identifiable persons, due to their previous

enemity with the de facto complainant, assaulted him and the second

accused caused a fracture below the left elbow while the first accused

slapped on the face of the de facto complainant thereby committing

the offences alleged. Thus, according to the prosecution the accused

Crl.M.C. No. 3443 OF 2013
                                     2

was      committed       the  offences   punishable    under    Sections

341,323,324,326,294(b) and 427 read with 34 of I.P.C.. Now, the case

of the petitioner is that the matter is settled with the second

respondent, who is the de facto complainant who sworn into Annexure

A2 affidavit.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who on the

basis of specific instruction received   from the respondent submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioner and he has no

grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.       I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

Crl.M.C. No. 3443 OF 2013
                                             3

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 341,323,324,326,294(b) and 427 read with 34 of                    I.P.C.

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/s accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In

this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.     The position that emerges from the above

          discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the High

          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

          exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

          offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

Crl.M.C. No. 3443 OF 2013
                                            4

           process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the

           criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised

           where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating

           to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is

           basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

           resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

           of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

           of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

           prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

           quashing the criminal case despite          full and complete

           settlement and compromise with the victim........"

           According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement

arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case.           Thus, I am of the view that as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

Crl.M.C. No. 3443 OF 2013
                                       5

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the

trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C.

can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure - A1

final report and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners

in C.C.No.278/2012        of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II,

Kollam in Crime No.458/2011 of Eravipuram            Police Station and all

further proceedings thereto.

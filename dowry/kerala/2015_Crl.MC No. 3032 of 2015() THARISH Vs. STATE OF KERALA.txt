               Crl.M.C. No.3032 of 2015
           --------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 27th day of May 2015

                          O R D E R

          Petition filed under Sec.482 Cr.P.C.

          2. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the 2nd

respondent. The 2nd petitioner is his mother. The

petitioners are accused in C.C. No.117 of 2015 on the file

of the Judicial 1st Class Magistrate Court-I, Aluva. The

prosecution allegation is that they subjected the 2nd

respondent to cruelty demanding more dowry and thus

committed the offence under Secs.498A read with Sec.34

of Indian Penal Code. It is submitted that the dispute

between the parties has been settled. The request is to

quash the proceedings in the criminal case.

          3.   Heard      the    learned     counsel   for the

petitioners, the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The 2nd respondent has filed an affidavit to

the effect that the dispute has been settled and she has

no objection to the proceedings in the criminal case being

Crl.M.C. No.3032 of 2015 2

quashed. I am satisfied that the allegation is true. No

public interest is involved in this case. This is a fit case to

invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Sec.482

Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings in the criminal case.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The

proceedings in C.C. No.117 of 2015 on the file of the

Judicial 1st Class Magistrate Court, Aluva are quashed.

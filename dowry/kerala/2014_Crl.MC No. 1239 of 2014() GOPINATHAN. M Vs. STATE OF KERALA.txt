    ==============================
                   Crl.M.C.No.1239 of 2014
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 04th day of March, 2014.


                             O R D E R

      This   is  an     application  filed    by   the   accused      in

C.C.No.4215/13 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-II, Ernkalulam, to quash the proceedings under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

       2.   It is alleged in the petition that he is conducting an

establishment by name M/s. Interlinks dealing with kitchen

equipments and other items. The de facto complainant was a staff

of that establishment. On 13.09.2013, was the day of his mother's

birthday, so, he had a plan to take the mother to temple and share

more time with the mother. But, the de facto complainant reported

very late in the office and so he was little harsh with her for her late

coming and he had warned her except that nothing transpired at

that time. But, later, she filed a complaint against the petitioner on

the basis of which Annexure A1, First Information Report was

registered as Crime No.1902/13 originally alleging offences under

Sections.341, 323, 354 and 294(b) of Indian Penal Code. Later,

Section 354 of Indian Penal Code was deleted and Section 354A (i)

(iv) of Indian Penal Code was added and Annexure A2 final report

was filed which was taken on file as C.C.No.4215/2013 on the file of

Crl.M.C.No.1239 of 2014          :  2 :

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Ernkalulam. In

the meantime, the matter has been settled between the

parties. It is alleged in the First Information Statement that

de facto complainant's husband was also assaulted in the

incident. In fact, the allegations will not attract the offence

and the matter has been settled between the parties.                   No

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case and since it

is non-compoundable offence, it is not possible to file an

application for compounding before the court below.                   So,

petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this court

seeking the following relief:

            "To call for the records leading to Annexure A1, FIR and

    Annexure A2 charge sheet and may be pleased to quash

    Annexure A2 charge sheet in C.C.No.4215/2012 on the files of

    the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II, Ernakulam and allow

    this Criminal Miscellaneous Case."

       3.    Subsequently,       the    husband      of   the  de    facto

complainant was also impleaded as additional third respondent

and both the de facto complainant and her husband were

represented by the Counsel and submitted that since the

matter has been settled between the parties and they have no

grievance against the petitioner now and they have no

objection in quashing the proceedings.              The application was

opposed by the Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No.1239 of 2014     : 3 :

       4.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent, Annexure A1 crime

was registered as Crime No.1902/13 originally alleging

offences under Sections.341, 323, 354 & 294(b) of Indian

Penal Code. Only later, 354 of Indian Penal Code was deleted

and Section.354A (i) (iv) was incorporated and the final report

was filed.      Even in the First Information Statement, the

allegation was that since she came late, there was some

altercation occurred between the petitioner and the de facto

complainant and some gestures were shown and abused with

obscene language. The exact obscene words used were not

mentioned either in the First Information Statement or

statement of the witnesses or in the final report filed as well.

Now, the matter has been settled between the parties. Even

as per the allegations, it cannot be said that it was done with

any criminal intention, but, due to some provocation caused

on account of some inconvenience caused to the petitioner on

account of the late coming of the de facto complainant. Since

the matter has been settled between the parties, no purpose

will be served by allowing the prosecution to continue as well

as neither the de facto complainant or her husband or other

witnesses are going to support the case of the prosecution.

Crl.M.C.No.1239 of 2014          :   4 :

The possibility of conviction is also removed in such

circumstances.

       5.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], is held as follows:

       "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
       summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
       criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
       inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
       given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
       S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
       no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
       with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure
       the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of
       any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
       proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
       offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend
       on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category
       can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,
       the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
       gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
       depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
       be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
       and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
       not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
       Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender
       in relation to the offences under special statutes like
       Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by
       public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
       provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
       involving such offences.      But the criminal cases having
       overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
       different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
       the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
       civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences
       arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
       disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
       nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
       this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court
       must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the

Crl.M.C.No.1239 of 2014           :  5 :

       interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
       continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to
       abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise
       between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure
       the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put
       to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
       affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction
       to quash the criminal proceeding."

        6.   In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the de facto complainant, her husband and

the petitioner and there is no possibility of any conviction if

the prosecution is allowed to continue in view of the

settlement, allowing the prosecution to continue will only be a

mere wastage of judicial time, this court feels that it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

       So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.4215/13 (Crime No.1902/2013 of Central Police

Station, Ernakulam) on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-II, Ernakulam, against the petitioner is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court for necessary further action.

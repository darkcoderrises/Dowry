                             V.K.MOHANAN, J
                    ===========================
                          Crl.M.C No.5100 of 2014
                   ============================
                Dated this the 19th day of September, 2014

                                   ORDER


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners, who

are accused Nos.1 to 3 in S.C.No.475/2014 of the Sessions Court,

Kasaragod, which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.

512/2013 of Kumbla Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323 and 354 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure I final report and all further proceedings in S.C No.475/2014 of

Sessions Court, Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that on 19.08.2013 at

about 3:30 p.m while the de facto complainant was travelling in a bike

driven by her uncle, the petitioners wrongfully restrained her and attacked

her and the petitioners have attempted to outrage her modesty and thereby

committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the petitioners is

that the matter is settled out of court.

Crl.M.C No.5100 of 2014
                                       2

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the 1st

respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received    from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case, it

can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are under Sections 341,

323 and 354 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, which are more or less

Crl.M.C No.5100 of 2014
                                             3

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can
           be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
           power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of
           the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
           facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
           prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
           of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
           financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or
           the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
           nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
           its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim,
           the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

Crl.M.C No.5100 of 2014
                                         4

          criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
          and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
          criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
          with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present case,

the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I

am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I final report

and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in S.C.No. 475/2014

of the Sessions Court, Kasaragod in Crime No.512/2013 of Kumbla Police

Station.

          Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 21st day of June, 2013.


                         O R D E R

        As the parties, in the above two M.Cs. filed under

section 482 of Cr.P.C., are one and the same and the facts

and circumstances of the cases are identical and especially

the above M.Cs. are filed against the case and counter in

Crime Nos.744/13 and 745/13 of Sooranadu police station,

at the instance of the petitioner/accused in each case, are

heard together and being disposed by this common order.

     2. Crime No.744/13 is registered at the instance of

one Geevarghese, the de facto complainant who is the

accused in Crime No.744/13 of the same police station. In

Crime No.744/13, the offences alleged against are under

sections 324 and 326 of IPC.           Whereas, the offences

alleged in Crime No.745/13 are under sections 341 and 323

of IPC, in which the de facto complainant is the accused in

                                  2
Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


Crime No.744/13. The place of occurrence in both the

cases is one and the same, ie., at Punnamoodu junction in

Poruvazhi village in Sasthamcotta, and near to the house

of both the de facto complainants in the above two cases.

Now the case of the petitioner in both the cases are that

they have settled the matter mutually through an

amicable settlement. In Crl.M.C.No.2492/13, the de facto

complainant is the 2nd respondent herein and his

notarized affidavit is filed as Annexure B, whereas in

Crl.M.C.No.2493/13, the de facto complainant is the 2nd

respondent herein, who has also preferred a notarized

affidavit as Annexure B.

         3. The allegation in Crl.M.C.No.2492 of 2013 is

that on 11.5.2013 at 5 p.m., the petitioner assaulted the

de facto complainant striking him with a splinter of wood

and causing him fracture of ulna of the right hand and he

threw a brick piece at de facto complainant which hit him

on his right leg causing injury to one of the fingers.

Whereas, the allegation in Crl.M.C.No.2493 of 2013 is

that, on 11.6.2012 at 6.15 p.m. the petitioner assaulted

                                  3
Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


the de facto complainant with hands, on his left cheek

causing pain and twisted his hand thereby causing

abrasion and pain. Now, the case of the petitioner in

each case is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in

each case as well as the 2nd respondent in each case. I

have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner in each

case has submitted that during the pendency of the above

crimes, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above crimes.           Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crimes is abuse of process of

law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent in

each case, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondent submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant in each case,

does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner in each case and the 2nd respondent in each

                                   4
Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


case has no grievance against the petitioner in each case.

         6.    I   have      carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petitions. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petitions.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the cases, it can be seen that the offences

involved in Crime No.744/13, are only under sections 324

and 326 of IPC, whereas, the offences alleged in Crime

No.745/13 are under sections 341 and 323 of IPC, which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved.      It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matters. From the submission made by the counsel for

the 2nd respondent in each case, it appears to me that the

                                    5
Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner in each case in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note

the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-




                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of
         its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised     in   accord   with   the   guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any Court. In what cases power to
         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or
         F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend
         on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But    the   criminal   cases   having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising       from      commercial,     financial,
         mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

                                   6
Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
         disputes where the wrong is basically private
         or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category
         of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim,
         the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would
         put accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to him
         by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with
         the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved    in the    above    cases and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the above

cases, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable

in these cases. According to me, as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be

sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

Crl.M.C.Nos.2492 and 2493 of 2013


court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.Cs. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed,

quashing Annexure-A FIR in Crime No.744/13 of

Sooranad police station and Annexure-A FIR in Crime

No.745/13 of Sooranad police station and all further

proceedings on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate court, Sasthamcotta.

                  Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 19th day of June, 2013

                               ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in Crime No.1340 of 2012 of

Hill Palace Police Station, Thripunithura which is a crime

registered against the petitioner for the non-compliance of the

terms of agreement in Annexure-B for the offences punishable

under Sections 420 of IPC and 3(1)(v) of Scheduled Castes and

Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 with a

prayer to quash Annexue-A F.I.R. and all further proceedings

in Crime No.1340 of 2012 of Hill Palace Police Station,

Thripunithura as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The allegation against the petitioner is that, in a

transaction  between       the   petitioner     and    the de facto

complainant, who belonged to Scheduled Caste community, he

borrowed an amount of `3,00,000/- from the petitioner and he

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                              :-2-:


executed sale deed of his property having an extent of 3.5

cents with a house of 1050 square feet thereon comprised in

Survey No.514/2 of Nadama Village as security for the said

amount in favour of the accused and further allegation is that

the accused/petitioner had effected mutation on the above

property prior to 24/4/2010 using the sale deed without proper

consideration and thus the petitioner has committed the

offences.   Now the case of the petitioner is that, though

connected with the above transaction dispute arose and the

first respondent/de facto complainant herein preferred a suit

before the first Additional Sub Judge, Ernakulam with a prayer

to set aside the sale of the property referred above and during

the pendency of the above suit the matter is settled amicably.

The suit filed by the petitioner against the first respondent,

which was pending as O.S.No.91 of 2011 and the matter was

settled as per Annexure-B settlement arrived at the District

Mediation Centre, Ernakulam and therefore according to the

petitioner this Crl.M.C. can be disposed of quashing Annexure-

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                              :-3-:


A crime pending against the petitioner.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                             :-4-:


Annexure-B agreement and Annexure-C affidavit. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 420 of IPC and 3(1)

(v) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act, 1989 which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioner/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                                       :-5-:


reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                                  :-6-:


        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2013

                            :-7-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexue-A F.I.R. and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioner in Crime No.1340 of 2012 of Hill Palace Police

Station, Thripunithura.

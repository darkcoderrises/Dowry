                      Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 7th day of April, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This petition is filed by accused Nos.1 to 4 in

C.C.No.74/2009 pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Palakkad to quash the proceedings on account of the

settlement arrived at between the parties under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are accused

1 to 4 in C.C.No.74/2009 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Palakkad. The case was originally registered

on the basis of the statement given by the defacto complainant,

who is the second respondent herein, against the petitioners

alleging offences under Sections 324, 427, 341 and 326 read

with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.74/2009 and

it is pending before the Chief                  Judicial Magistrate       Court,

Palakkad. In fact, it was a matrimonial dispute between the 7th

respondent    and the         first petitioner,             that resulted in the

incident. Now due to intervention of mediators,                        the entire

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014                  2

dispute has been resolved and they are now living                  together.

The injured in the case is none other than the brother of the

7th respondent, and           in view of the subsequent developments

in order to bring harmony in the family relationship, he does not

want to prosecute the case against the petitioners and                  also

wanted to promote harmony that has been restored on account

of the settlement between the the first respondent and the 7th

respondent. So no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case. Since some of the offences are non compoundable in

nature, they could not file           application before the court below.

So the petitioners have no other option except to approach this

Court seeking the following relief:

              For these and other grounds that may be urged at

              the    time of hearing this Hon'ble Court may be

              pleased to allow this petition and quash all further

              proceedings in    C.C.No.74/2009, arising    out of

              Crime No.515/2008 of Town South Police Station,

              Palakkad, on the files of   learned Chief   Judicial

              Magistrate's Court, Palakkad, so as to secure the


              ends of justice.

        3. When the application came up for hearing, the learned

counsel for respondents            2 to 7 submitted that the matter has

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014          3

been settled between the parties and they do not want to

prosecute the petitioners in view of the settlement and they

filed Annexure A2 series affidavit stating these facts.

        4. The learned Public Prosecutor,   on instructions     as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners and it was a family dispute. Though a

counter case was registered in respect of the same incident at

the instance of one of the petitioners, after investigation it was

referred as a false case and opposed the application on the

ground that the offence under Section 326 has been committed.

        5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view

of the settlement, no purpose will be served in proceeding with

the case and he prayed for allowing the application.

        6. It is an admitted fact that the first petitioner is the

husband of the 7th respondent and at the time of the incident,

the relationship was not cordial and the petitioners as well as

respondents 2 to 7 are related by marriage of the first

petitioner with the 7th respondent. It is an admitted fact that on

the basis of the statement given by the second respondent,

Crime No.515/2008 of Town South police station, Palakkad

was registered and after investigation Anneure A1 final report

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014            4

was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.74/2009 by the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Palakkad and it is pending before

that court. Now the mater has been settled between the parties.

Respondents 2 to 7, who are the defacto complainants           and

other injured persons       filed  Annexure A2   series  affidavits

stating that the matter has been settled between the parties

due to       intervention of   family members and    relatives and

friends and now the 7th respondent is living with the first

petitioner, who is her husband, and in view of the       fact that

maritable dispute has been settled and the first petitioner and

the 7th respondent        are living together, they do not want to

prosecute the present case and         it should not a hurdle for

their happy married life as well. So considering the fact that

maritable relationship between the first petitioner and the 7th

respondent has been restored on account of the settlement and

both the parties felt that pendency of this case should not be a

hurdle for the same, they have decided to settle the claim and

does not want to prosecute the case, no purpose will be served

by allowing the case to continue as neither the defacto

complainants nor other witnesses will support the case of the

prosecution.

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014                  5

        7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite full and   complete    settlement   and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014                   6

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




        8. In view of the above decision and considering the fact

that the entire incident happened due to some matrimonial

dispute between the first petitioner and the 7th respondent

and the matter has been now                  settled and       they are living

together, no purpose will be served by proceeding with the case

in view of the settlement, this Court feels that it is a fit case

where the power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote harmony that has

been restored between the first petitioner and the 7th

respondent and this case will not be a hurdle for their happy

married live. So the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.No.74/2009 (Crime No.515/2008 of Town South Police

Station, Palakkad) pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Palakkad as against the petitioners are quashed.

        Office is directed to            communicate this order to the

Crl.M.C.No.1990 of 2014            7

concerned court immediately for necessary further action in

this regard .

                  ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
           =========================
                   Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014
         ============================
          Dated this the 14th day of October, 2014

                            ORDER



     The above Criminal Miscellaneous Case (Crl.M.C.) has been

filed with the prayer to quash Annexure I final report/charge

sheet, Annexure II final report and all further proceedings against

the petitioner, now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II, Perinthalmanna, as C.C.No. 297 of 2013.

The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.297 of 2013 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Perinthalmanna for

offences alleged under Sections 324, 341 and 354 of Indian Penal

Code. The case is registered upon a complaint filed by the 2nd

respondent before the Mankada Police and registered as Crime

No.89 of 2013 at that Police Station as per Annexure I FIR. R2 is

the injured and R3 is the eye witness.

     2. The brief of the prosecution case is that the petitioner is

a teacher and 2nd and 3rd respondents are students in Anvarul

Islam Arabic College, Tirurkkad. On 02.03.2013 between 10:15

a.m and 11 a.m, the accused had beaten the 2nd respondent with a

stick and dragged him in front of the boys and pulled out from

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014         2



class room on the reason that he was absent in the special class

conducted on 01.03.2013. Final report/charge sheet was filed in

this matter as per Annexure II and the case is pending as C.C

No.297 of 2013 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -

II, Perinthalmanna. The accused had entered appearance and

released on bail. R2 and R3 were examined as PW1 and PW2

respectively in the above case. Subsequently, the difference of

opinion between the petitioner and the contesting respondents

was resolved through mediation and two applications for

recalling the witnesses and reopening the evidence as per

Annexures III and investigation were dismissed by the learned

Magistrate. In view of the settlement, 2nd and 3rd respondents

are not in any way interested in prosecuting the case against the

petitioner and Annexures V and VI affidavits have been sworn to

by 2nd and 3rd respondents to that effect. In the said affidavit, it

is stated by the contesting respondents that the matter has been

settled and that they are not interested to go ahead with the

prosecution in any manner. It is in the background of these facts

and circumstances that the aforementioned Crl.M.C has been

filed.

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014          3



      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Smt.Liji

Kuttappan has taken notice for the 2nd and 3rd respondents and

the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      4.    Heard Sri.U.K.Devidas, the learned counsel appearing

for the petitioner, Smt.Liji Kuttappan learned counsel appearing

for 2nd and 3rd respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor

appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Kearla.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Smt.Liji Kuttappan, the learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd and 3rd respondents has submitted on the basis of the

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014          4



specific instructions furnished by the 2nd and 3rd respondents that

the 2nd and 3rd respondents have amicably settled the disputes

with the petitioner and that they have no objection in the

quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that the

complainants/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner as they have no grievance against

him and that they will not raise any dispute/compliant in future if

the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and

not much element of public interest is involved. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014                 5



by the learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it is clear

to the court that the injured/victim/defacto complainants have no

further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of

the settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Apex Court in the case

between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1)

SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108

(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                  "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.        In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
         facts and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
          offences          arising       from        commercial,
          financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014              6



         relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
         the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
         between the offender and victim, the possibility of
         conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
         criminal case would put accused to great oppression
         and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with the
         victim........"

      In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014

(8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426

(SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

                "When the High Court is convinced that the
         offences are entirely personal in nature and, therefore,
         do not affect public peace or tranquility and where it
         feels that quashing of such proceedings on account of
         compromise would bring about peace and would
         secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
         them".

      The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014          7



the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

Crl.M.C No.5611 of 2014          8



         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure II final report/charge sheet and all further proceedings

taken thereon pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.297 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II,

Perinthalmanna arising out of Crime No.89 of 2013 of Mankada

Police Station are quashed.        The petitioner shall produce

certified copies of this order before the court below concerned

as well as before the Station House Officer, Mankada Police

Station.

                      B.A.No. 4757 of 2013
                   -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 9th day of July 2013


                              ORDER


      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.724/2013 of

Sasthamcottah     Police    Station,     registered     for offences

punishable under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code. He

has filed the above application seeking pre-arrest bail under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for short "the

Code".

      2.    Crime was registered recording the statement of

defacto complainant, wife of petitioner, alleging infliction of

matrimonial cruelty by him demanding dowry.                She was

treated with utmost cruelty and harassed both physically and

mentally demanding dowry by petitioner was her case. On

21.04.2013 petitioner assaulted and inflicted injuries to her,

and, when it was prevented by her son and also one of her

relatives they too were assaulted by him, was her further case.

Crime registered on such allegations is now pending

investigation.

      3.    Learned counsel for petitioner submits that

marriage between parties took place on 09.11.1995 and in the

B.A.No. 4757 of 2013            2




wedlock spouses have a child, now aged 14 years.           He is

falsely implicated in the crime on baseless allegations is the

submission of counsel to urge for granting him pre-arrest bail.

Opposing the application learned Public Prosecutor submits

that     materials gathered by investigating agency disclose

complicity of petitioner in the offence imputed and his arrest

and custodial interrogation is essential for a fair investigation

of the crime.

       4.     Case Diary has been produced for my perusal.

After looking into the Case Diary with reference to the

submissions made by counsel on both sides I find enough

reason to suspect complicity of petitioner in the offence

imputed and when that be so, he is not entitled to pre-arrest

bail. However, having regard to the circumstances that the

crime is registered over matrimonial disputes of spouses I

find, an opportunity can be extended to him to surrender

before the investigating officer and co-operate with the

investigation while declining anticipatory bail.

       In case petitioner surrender before the     investigating

officer at 10 AM on 15.07.2013, after his interrogation and in

the event of his arrest in the crime, he shall be produced

before magistrate of competent jurisdiction without delay. On

B.A.No. 4757 of 2013           3




such production, application for bail, if any, moved by

petitioner with advance notice to Assistant Public Prosecutor

also, shall be considered and decided by the magistrate

expeditiously and disposed of on its merits in accordance with

law.

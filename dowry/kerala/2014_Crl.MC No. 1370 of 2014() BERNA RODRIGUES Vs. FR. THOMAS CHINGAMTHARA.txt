                 Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 04th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by the accused persons in

C.C.No.548/07 (Crime No.1252/06 of Central Police Station,

Ernakulam) on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-II, Ernakulam, to quash the proceedings after

recording the composition under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2.  It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners were

the accused in C.C.No.548/07 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Ernakulam.         The case was

registered as Crime No.1252/06 of Central Police Station,

Ernakulam, on the basis of the statement given by first

respondent herein as de-facto complainant alleging offences

under Sections.143, 147, 120(B), 341, 294(b) read with

Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and after investigation,

Annexure A1 final report was filed against the petitioners alone

alleging offences under Sections.448 & 294(b) read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code alone. The case was taken on

file as C.C.No.548/07 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014       :   2 :

Magistrate Court, No-II, Ernakulam, and the case is now

pending before that court. It is alleged in the petition that

there was a counter case in respect of the same incident

against the first respondent as C.C.No.179/07 on the file of the

same court and the same was quashed by this court as per

Annexure A3 order. The matter has been settled between the

parties. The first respondent has filed Annexure A2 affidavit

confirming the settlement and expressing his willingness to

quash the proceedings. No purpose will be served in allowing

the prosecution to continue in view of the settlement. Since

some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, the

petitioners could not move the lower court for compounding.

So, petitioners have no other remedy except to approach this

court seeking the following relief:

            "To allow this Criminal Miscellaneous Case and quash

    Annexure A1 Final report and other proceedings in CC

    No.548/2007 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

    Ernakulam in the interest of justice."

       3.    First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted the matter has been settled between the parties and

the first respondent has filed an affidavit to that effect.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014       : 3 :

directed to this court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case pending against the petitioners and they have no

criminal background, but, opposed the application on the

ground that they were absconding.

     5.      It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by first respondent as de facto complainant,

Crime No.1252/06 of Central Police Station was registered

originally alleging offences under Sections. 143, 147, 120(B),

341, 294(b) read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and

after investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed against

the    present      petitioners alone alleging  offences  under

Sections.294(b), 448 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code alone and that was taken on file as C.C.No.548/07 and it

is pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-

II, Ernakulam. It is also admitted in the petition itself that

since the petitioners did not appear, proceedings have been

initiated against them under Sections. 82 and 83 of Code of

Criminal Procedure and non-bailable warrants are pending

against them. It is during this period, that they have settled

the claim with first respondent. It is also an admitted fact that

on the basis of the statement given by the first petitioner,

another crime was registered against the first respondent as

Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014         :   4 :

Crime No.1241/06 of the same police station and after

investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.179/07 on the file of the same magistrate court against

the present first respondent and since the matter was settled

between the first petitioner and the accused in that case who is

the first respondent herein, the same was quashed by this

court as per Annexure A3 order. Now, the petitioners have

come before this court to quash this case as well which was

originated on the basis of the statement given by first

respondent in respect of the same incident. It is also seen

from the allegations that it was due to some misunderstanding

between two factions of the of the same community that this

incident had happened and due to the intervention of the

religious leaders and other friends of both the groups,

settlement has been arrived at and harmony has been restored

between the them.

       6.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] is held as follows:

       The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
       summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
       criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
       inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
       given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
       S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
       no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
       with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure
       the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014         :  5 :

       any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
       proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
       offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend
       on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category
       can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,
       the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
       gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
       depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
       be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
       and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
       not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
       Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender
       in relation to the offences under special statutes like
       Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by
       public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
       provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
       involving such offences.      But the criminal cases having
       overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
       different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
       offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
       partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising
       out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
       disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
       nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
       this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
       case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
       with the victim.      In other words, the High Court must
       consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest
       of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
       continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to
       abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise
       between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the
       ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
       end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
       affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction
       to quash the criminal proceeding."




       7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the decision

mentioned above and also considering the fact that the matter

has been settled between the parties and on account of the

Crl.M.C.No. 1370 of 2014     :  6 :

settlement, religious harmony has been restored between two

factions of the same community and no purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case on account of the settlement, this

court feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash

the proceedings in order to promote the religious harmony

that has been restored between two groups of the same

community on account of the settlement arrived at between

them and there is remote possibility of conviction also even if

the matter is allowed to proceed as the de facto complainant

will not support the case of the prosecution.

       So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.548/07 (Crime No.1252/06 of Central Police Station,

Ernakulam) on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-II, Ernakulam, as against the petitioners is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned magistrate court for necessary further actions in

this regard.

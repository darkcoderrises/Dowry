          CRL.M.C.No. 1201   OF 2010
          ===========================

     Dated this the 7th day of April,2010

                     ORDER


    First petitioner is the husband and fourth

petitioner the wife.   Petitioners 2 and 3 are

the parents of the first petitioner.     Fourth

petitioner is the de facto complainant and

petitioners  1  to   3  are   the  accused   in

C.P.13/2010 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate's   Court-III,    Kozhikode    taken

cognizance for the offences under sections 323,

406,498A and   313   read with section 34 of

Indian Penal Code on Annexure A1 final report.

Prosecution  case  is  that   first  petitioner

married the fourth petitioner on 30.5.1999 and

while they were living as husband and wife

first petitioner obtained the gold ornaments

given to the fourth petitioner by her parents

and sold them under the pretext       that the

Crl.M.C.1201/2010             2

amount will be utilised for purchasing property in

the name of the fourth petitioner,        but in breach

of trust, first petitioner misappropriated the same

and thereafter treated her with cruelty demanding

more dowry and       physically treated her with cruelty

and without her       consent  fourth petitioner she was

compelled        to consume medicine for abortion and

thereby       caused   miscarriage  and  committed   the

offences. Petition is filed jointly by the de facto

complainant       and  the    accused  contending   that

entire       disputes    were   settled   amicably   and

consequent to the settlement, it is not in the

interest of justice to continue the prosecution.

      2.         Fourth petitioner   filed  a   separate

affidavit stating that she has settled all the

matrimonial       disputes  with  the  petitioners   and

consequent to the settlement, it is not in the

interest of justice to continue the prosecution.

      3.         Learned  counsel  appearing   for   the

petitioners       and  learned  Public  Prosecutor  were

heard.

Crl.M.C.1201/2010            3

      4.         The  offences  alleged   against  the

petitioners are matrimonial offences.        Though an

offence under section 313 of IPC is also alleged,

it is based on the allegation that without the

consent of the fourth petitioner she was compelled

to consume medicine for abortion and thereby caused

miscarriage.        The affidavit filed by the fourth

petitioner establishes that the entire disputes

were settled and consequent to the settlement even

if    petitioners    are  to  be tried,  there  is no

likelihood of a successful prosecution.     As held by

the Apex Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of

Punjab(2008(3) KLT 19, Manoj Sharma v. State (2008

(4) KLT 417 and B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana

(2003) 4 SCC 675) when the matrimonial offences are

settled amicably and all the disputes were settled

and consequent to the settlement, there is no

chance of a successful prosecution, it is not in

the      interest    of   justice  to   continue   the

prosecution.

      Petition is allowed.     C.P.13/2010 on the file

Crl.M.C.1201/2010       4

of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-III,

Kozhikode is quashed.

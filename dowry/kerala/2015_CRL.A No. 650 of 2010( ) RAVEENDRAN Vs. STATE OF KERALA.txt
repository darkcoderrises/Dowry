                Dated this the 16th day of June, 2015


                               JUDGMENT


Sudheendra Kumar, J.


      The appellant is the accused in S.C.No.1038 of 2006 on the

files of the First Additional Sessions Court, Kollam, who in this

appeal challenges the judgment of conviction and sentence passed

by the trial court under Section 302 IPC. The trial court sentenced

the appellant to imprisonment for life and a fine of 5,000/- with a

default clause for simple imprisonment for six months under Section

302 IPC.



      2. The prosecution allegation is that on 24.8.2003 at about 12

noon, the appellant inflicted injuries on the head, neck and chest of

deceased Sheela with MO3 chopper and as a consequence, the

deceased succumbed to the injuries at or about the same time. The

                                     :: 2 ::

deceased was the wife of the appellant.          The deceased was

having 60,000/- in her account as sale proceeds of her property.

The deceased was not prepared to give the said amount to the

appellant. This is stated to be the motive for the incident.



      3. On the basis of Ext.P1 first information statement given by

PW1, Ext.P1(a) FIR was registered by PW20. The investigation was

taken over by PW22 on 24.8.2003 itself. On that day, he arrested

the appellant. On 25.8.2003, PW22 conducted the inquest on the

body of the deceased and prepared Ext.P3 inquest report. On that

day, PW22 also prepared Ext.P2 scene mahazar after visiting the

place of occurrence. On the basis of the disclosure statement given

by the appellant, MO3 chopper was recovered by PW22 on

25.8.2003. PW19, the then Circle Inspector of Police, verified the

records and filed the final report before the Court.



      4.   The learned Magistrate, after complying with the legal

formalities, committed the case to the Sessions Court, Kollam. The

Sessions Court made over the case to the trial court for trial and

disposal in accordance with law.

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                  :: 3 ::

      5.   Since the appellant did not plead guilty, the trial was

conducted. In the trial, PW1 to PW22 were examined and Exts.P1

to P16 were marked for the prosecution, besides identifying MO1 to

MO9. After the closing of the prosecution evidence, the appellant

was examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the

incriminating materials appearing in the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses. The appellant had taken the plea of alibi. Thereafter,

since there was no scope for an order of acquittal under Section 232

Cr.P.C, the court below called upon the appellant to enter on his

defence. However, the appellant did not adduce any defence

evidence.



      6.   We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant

Sri.C.Prathapachandran Pillai and the learned Public Prosecutor

Sri.Rajesh Vijayan.



      7. PW15 was the doctor who conducted autopsy on the body

of the deceased and issued Ext.P10 postmortem certificate. PW15

opined that the death of the deceased was due to the injuries

sustained to the head and neck. There is absolutely no material

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                   :: 4 ::

before the Court inconsistent with the finding of PW15 that the death

of the deceased was due to the injuries sustained on the head and

neck of the deceased. In the said circumstances, we are satisfied

that the deceased Sheela died due to the injuries sustained on her

head and neck.



      8.  PW1 is the brother of deceased Sheela.         On getting

information with regard to the death of the deceased, PW1 rushed to

the place of occurrence. He found the deceased lying on the rear

courtyard. PW1 did not witness the incident. According to PW1, the

deceased sold her property and obtained an amount of 1.5 lakhs as

sale proceeds. Out of the said amount, an amount of 60,000/- was

deposited in the Service Co-operative Bank in the account of the

deceased. The appellant wanted the said amount, for which the

deceased was not prepared. This is stated to be the motive for the

incident.  PW1 further stated that the deceased was a disabled

woman.     Therefore, there was also quarrel by the appellant with

regard to the quantum of dowry.       However, there is no material

before the Court to prove the same. It appears from the evidence

of PW13 coupled with Ext.P8 mahazar that the amount was

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                   :: 5 ::

deposited by the deceased in the joint account of the deceased and

the appellant. An amount of 72,000/- was deposited in the bank in

the joint account. Out of the said amount, an amount of 60,000/-

was withdrawn from the bank on 21.4.2003. An amount of 12,327/-

alone was there in the account as on 3.9.2003. This shows that the

evidence of PW1 with regard to the motive for the incident, cannot

be correct.



      9. PW3 and PW4 are daughters of the deceased. They were

examined by the prosecution to prove that the appellant had

committed the offence after sending PW3 and PW4 to the shop to

purchase beedi.    However, PW3 and PW4 did not support the

prosecution case. They stated that the appellant was not having the

habit of smoking beedi. They further stated that they were not in the

house of the appellant and that they were in the house of the elder

brother of the appellant on the date of incident.



      10. PW2 was another witness examined by the prosecution to

prove the incident. PW2 also did not support the prosecution case.

PW5 was cited by the prosecution to prove the conduct of the

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                  :: 6 ::

appellant after the incident. However, PW5 also turned inimical to

the prosecution. PW6, the wife of PW5, was also examined to prove

the conduct of the appellant subsequent to the incident. However,

PW6 also did not support the prosecution case.



      11. PW7 was the shop owner, from whom PW3 and PW4 had

allegedly purchased beedi for the appellant. However, PW7 did not

support the prosecution case. PW7 stated that PW3 and PW4 did

not come to his shop to purchase beedi on the fateful day.



      12. PW8 is running a tea shop near to the house of the

deceased. PW8 is the husband of PW2. PW8 was examined by

the prosecution to prove Ext.P4 inquest report and the conduct of

the appellant immediately after the incident. He admitted his

signature in Ext.P4 inquest report prepared by PW22. However,

PW8 did not support the prosecution case regarding the conduct of

the appellant.



      13. PW9 is another witness to Ext.P4 inquest report. PW9

admitted to have witnessed the inquest and signed Ext.P4 inquest

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                  :: 7 ::

report. PW10 is an attester to Ext.P5 scene mahazar. He admitted

his signature in Ext.P5 scene mahazar. PW11 is an attester to

Ext.P6 mahazar prepared by PW22 in connection with the recovery

of MO3 chopper. Even though PW11 admitted that he had put his

signature in Ext.P6 mahazar, he stated that he did not see the

appellant at the place at the time of signing Ext.P6 mahazar. He

also did not admit that he had seen the recovery of any weapon.

The further evidence of PW11 is that he signed Ext.P6 mahazar at

the police station when he went to the police station in connection

with some other matter. PW12 is an attester to Ext.P7 mahazar

prepared by PW22 in connection with the recovery of MO4 lungie

worn by the appellant at the relevant time. PW12 admitted to have

signed Ext.P7 mahazar.     However, PW12      did not support the

prosecution case that MO4 lungie was recovered as per Ext.P7

mahazar.



      14. PW13 was present when the police inspected the account

of the deceased in the Service Co-operative Bank. He admitted to

have signed Ext.P8 mahazar prepared by the police in this regard.

He further stated that the said account was a joint account of the

                                   :: 8 ::

deceased and the appellant, in which an amount of 72,000/- was

there as on 21.4.2003. However, on 21.4.2003, an amount of

60,000/- was withdrawn from the said account and the remaining

amount as on 3.9.2003 was 12,327/-.



      15. PW14 is the Scientific Expert, who examined the material

objects and issued Ext.P9 analysis report. Ext.P9 would show that

MO3 chopper was stained with human blood belonging to 'O' group.

The evidence of PW14 coupled with Ext.P9 would further show that

MO4 lungie worn by the appellant at the relevant time contained

blood. However, the blood was insufficient to find out the origin and

the group.



      16. PW16 is a police constable who was deputed to guard the

scene. PW17 is another police constable, who took the body of the

deceased for postmortem examination.        PW18 is another police

constable, who was on guard duty at the place where MO3 chopper

was found lying. PW21 was examined to prove that the appellant

had kept MO3 chopper at the bottom of a coconut sapling near to the

burial place of the mother of the appellant. However, PW21 did not

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                    :: 9 ::

support the prosecution case. In the said circumstances, Ext.P11

contradiction in the CD statement of PW21 was marked for the

prosecution.



      17. PW22 was the Circle Inspector of Police, who took over

the investigation on 24.8.2003. PW22 stated that he arrested the

appellant on 24.8.2003 and when questioned, the appellant had

given statement that he kept MO3 chopper at the bottom of the

coconut sapling near to the burial place of his mother. PW22 went to

that place on 24.8.2003 itself. The appellant was not taken along

with PW22 at that time. PW22 found out MO3 chopper at the bottom

of the coconut sapling. Thereafter, he deputed PW18 and another

police constable to guard that place. Ext.P11 contradiction would

show that the place from where MO3 was recovered was known to

others.   PW22 again went to that place on 25.8.2003 with the

appellant and recovered MO3 chopper.



      18. We have gone through the evidence of PW22 with regard

to the recovery of MO3 chopper. We find that the court below has

correctly stated its reasons to hold that the recovery of MO3 chopper

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                  :: 10 ::

will not come under the purview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act.

That apart, the evidence with regard to the recovery of MO3 chopper

is not supported by any other witness, even though PW11 had

admitted to have signed in Ext.P6 mahazar. MO3 chopper is found

to be stained with blood. However, the origin and group of the blood

could not be determined as the quantity of blood was insufficient.

Apart from the evidence of PW22 regarding the recovery of MO3

chopper, there is no other material to connect the appellant with the

commission of the offence.       Even the motive alleged by the

prosecution is not proved by the prosecution.



      19. The court below found the appellant guilty on the basis of

hearsay information furnished by PW1. It is settled law that moral

conviction is not good in law. We have meticulously gone through

the evidence and we are fully satisfied that the court below convicted

the appellant based on a fragile foundation of surmises and

conjectures.




      20. In the absence of any evidence to bring home the guilt of

the appellant, we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to

Crl. A. NO.650 OF 2010

                                   :: 11 ::

establish that the appellant committed the offence under Section 302

IPC and hence, the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence passed

by the trial court under Section 302 I.P.C. cannot be sustained and

consequently, we set aside the same.



      In the result, this appeal stands allowed, setting aside the

conviction and sentence passed by the trial court under Section 302

IPC. The appellant is on bail.  Therefore, the bail bond of the

appellant stands cancelled and the appellant is set at liberty

forthwith.

                 Crl.M.C. NO. 2546 of 2014
            ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                             ORDER


      The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C. No. 315/2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvalla,

alleging offences punishable under Section 498A of the Indian

Penal Code. First respondent, the de facto complainant is the

wife of the petitioner.    The dispute between the parties was

settled before the Mediation Centre of Family Court, Thiruvalla, as

evident from Annexure B Memorandum of Agreement and both

parties agreed to withdraw all pending cases between them

including C.C. No. 315/2011 of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Thiruvalla.     Now the first respondent has also filed

Annexure C affidavit before this Court stating the said fact. The

prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash the proceedings in C.C. No.

315/2011 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Thiruvalla.

      2. Heard, the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the first respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor

for the second respondent.

      3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108, the

Crl.M.C. NO. 2546 of 2014         2


Apex Court held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the

purpose      of   quashing, particularly offences   arising   from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating to

dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

entire dispute. In these category of cases, High Court may quash

criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise

between the offender and the victim, the possibility of a

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

criminal case despite full and complete settlement and

compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court may

consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process

of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

Crl.M.C. NO. 2546 of 2014           3


to the above question is in affirmative the High Court shall be

well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.

      4. The allegation against the petitioner is commission of

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

Now as evident from Annexure B Memorandum of Agreement and

Annexure C affidavit, the entire disputes between the parties

have been settled amicably and the first respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioner.

The said stand was also taken by the learned counsel for the first

respondent. In such circumstances, I find this is a fit case in

which the proceedings in C.C. No. 315/2011 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvalla, can be quashed

invoking the powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid down by

the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case supra.

      5.    In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in C.C. No. 315/2011 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvalla, is quashed.

                    Crl.M.C. No. 2234 of 2015
              ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015

                               ORDER

      Petitioners are accused in Crime No. 475/2012 of

Kilimanoor Police Station pending as C.C. No. 1030/2013 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- II, Attingal. The

learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Section

498(A) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, based on a

private complaint filed by the second respondent. Now, it is

submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the second respondent has already

been settled and the second respondent has also sworn to an

affidavit which is produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A3.

Therefore, the prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash Annexure-1,

FIR, Annexure 2 Final Report in Crime No. 475/2012 of

Kiliminaoor Police Station and all further proceedings in C.C. No.

1030/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

II, Attingal.

Crl.M.C. No. 2234 of 2015              2

      2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the

learned counsel for the second respondent.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power

is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

Crl.M.C. No. 2234 of 2015            3

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand

on a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out

of matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes

where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and

the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these

categories of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings,

if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender

and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is remote and

Crl.M.C. No. 2234 of 2015              4

bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to

great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair

or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have committed an offence punishable under Section 498(A)

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

     5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the second respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second

Crl.M.C. No. 2234 of 2015            5

respondent has also stated that the second respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.

The second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this

Court as Annexure A3 in this regard.

      6.   In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in        Crime No.

475/2012 of Kilimanoor Police Station pending as C.C. No.

1030/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court- II, Attingal can be quashed by this Court invoking the

powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in

the light of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian

Sing's case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in Crime No. 475/2012 of Kilimanoor Police Station

pending as C.C. No. 1030/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court- II, Attingal against the petitioners are

quashed.

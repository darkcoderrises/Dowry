               ----------------------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
               ---------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 8th April, 2014

                           O R D E R


    This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 6 in

C.P. No. 65/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II, Pathanamthitta                 to     quash the

proceedings in view of the settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

    2. It is alleged in the petition that              petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 to 6 in C.P. 65/2013 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pathanamthitta. The

case was originated on the basis of a statement given by

the 1st respondent as defacto complainant as Crime No.

746/2011     of Aranmula Police Station alleging offences

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 325, 308 and 427

read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.                    After

investigation final report was filed and it was taken on file

as C.P. 65/2013 and it is pending before the Judicial first

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                2

Class Magistrate Court, Pathanamthitta. In the meantime

the matter has been settled between the        parties. The

parties are neighbours and the settlement       was arrived

at on account of the intervention of well-wishers of both

parties. In view of the settlement, the defacto complainant

is not now interested in prosecuting the case. No purpose

will be served by proceeding with the case as well in view

of the settlement. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in          nature, they could not    file the

application for compounding before the court below. So

they have no other remedy except to approach this Court

seeking the following reliefs:

              "For these and other grounds which

              may be urged at the time of hearing,

              it is most humbly payed that     this

              Hon'ble      Court maybe pleased to

              allow the criminal miscellaneous case

              and quash Annexure A charge sheet

              and further proceedings in C.P. No.

              65/2013 of the Court of the Judicial

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                3

              first         Class        Magistrate,

              Pathanamthitta      and   allow   the

              criminal miscellaneous case, so as to

              secure the ends of justice".

      3. The first respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that due to the intervention of mediators and

well-wishers in the locality of both parties, matter has been

settled and their friendship has been restored. So he does

not want to prosecute the petitioners and he has no

grievance against them any more and he had also submitted

that he had filed Annexure B affidavit stating these facts.

Counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in view of

settlement, the possibility of conviction is remote and he

prayed for allowing the application.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court,      submitted that except this case

there is no other         criminal case pending against the

petitioners and they have no criminal background,         but

opposed the application on the ground that grave offences

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                               4

have been committed and it is not a fit case to quash at this

stage.

      5.   It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement     given    by  the 1st respondent    as  defacto

complainant, Crime No. 746/2011 was registered against

the petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143, 147,

447, 323, 324, 325, 308 and 427 read with Section 149 of

the Indian Penal Code and after investigation Annexure A

final report was filed and it     was taken on file as C.P.

65/2013       and pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pathanamthitta. In the meantime the

matter has been settled between the parties.

      6. The    defacto complainant who is shown as first

respondent appeared through counsel and submitted that

the matter has been settled as they are neighbours due to

intervention of well-wishers of both parties in the locality

and on account of settlement he does not want to prosecute

the petitioners. Annexure -B affidavit was also filed by the

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                 5

first respondent stating these facts. It is true that        grave

offences like Sections 325 and 308 of Indian Penal Code

were incorporated. But considering the fact that the matter

has been settled between the parties and               they    are

neighbours and due to the intervention of mediators and

well-wishers their relationship has been restored and they

are now       living in harmony, there is no possibility        of

defacto complainant and his witnesses giving evidence

supporting the case of the prosecution and conviction           in

such case is remote.         So even this Court allows the

prosecution to continue, no purpose will be served and it

will be only a wastage of judicial time which can be

exercised by the court to consider a better case.

      7. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a
      criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code.      Inherent power is of wide

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                   6

      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
      such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
      to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
      cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
      complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
      offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
      and no category can be prescribed. However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due
      regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
      Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be
      fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's
      family and the offender have settled the dispute.
      Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the
      offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide    for   any   basis   for    quashing   criminal
      proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
      cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
      of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
      disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court
      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim,
      the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                   7

      case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High
      Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
      of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
      end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and the victim himself has appeared before

this Court and submitted that the matter has been settled and

he does not want to proceed           against the    petitioners  as

friendship and harmony has been restored on account of the

settlement and no possibility of conviction being entered into

against the petitioners and in view of        this fact proceeding

the case will be of no use as neither the complainant nor his

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution,       this  Court

feels that this is a fit case where the power under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote harmony that has been restored

Crl.M.C No. 2023 of 2014-G
                                 8

between the defacto complainant and the petitioners.

      Hence the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.P.65/2013      (Crime No. 746/2011 of Aaranmula       Police

Station) pending before the Judicial First class Magistrate Court

- II, Pathanamthitta as against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court- II, Pathanamthitta    for necessary

further action in this regard.

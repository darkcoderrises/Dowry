                        B.A. No. 393 of 2014
                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
            Dated this the 23rd day of January, 2014.

                                   ORDER


           The petitioners are the accused in Crime No.48 of

2014 of Maradu Police Station, who are alleged to have

committed offences punishable under Sections 498A and 354

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

           2. The allegation against the petitioners is that the

victim was ill-treated and tortured by the accused demanding

more dowry and the second petitioner, who is the third

accused, tried to          outrage the modesty of the defacto

complainant.

           3. The petitioners would say that the allegations

are totally false and no such incident as alleged has happened

and there have been efforts from the side of the defacto

complainant to see that the petitioners are put behind the bars

B.A.393/2014.                   2

and proceedings have been initiated repeatedly by the defacto

complainant.

             4. Learned Public Prosecutor only pointed out that

the investigation is only just commenced.

             5.  After having heard learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and having

perused the records, there seems to be force in the contention

raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners. Even though

it may not be possible at this point of time to say that the

petitioners are totally innocent, considering the nature of the

allegations against the petitioners and also the nature of the

offences,      it is felt that this is a fit case where     the

extraordinary jurisdiction needs to be exercised in favour of

the petitioners.

             Therefore, this application is allowed    on the

following conditions:

      i)      Petitioners  shall  surrender   before  the

      Investigating Officer on or before 30.01.2014, who,

B.A.393/2014.                    3

      after interrogation, shall produce them before the

      court concerned, which court, on application for bail

      being moved by the petitioners, shall release them

      on bail on each of them executing a bond for a sum

      of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand only) with

      two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

      satisfaction of the said court.



      ii) The court concerned may ensure the identity of

      the sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts

      produced by the sureties for the purpose of

      executing the bond.



      iii) Petitioners shall report before the Investigating

      Officer on every Wednesday between 9 a.m. and 11

      a.m. until further orders.

B.A.393/2014.                   4

      iv)    Petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to

      tamper with the evidence or influence or try to

      influence the witnesses.



      v) If any of the conditions is violated, bail granted

      to the petitioners shall stand cancelled, and the

      court concerned may take such steps as are

      available in law.




                                            P. BHAVADASAN,
                                                 JUDGE

                       ----------------------------
                         Dated 18th May, 2012

                                 ORDER

            This is an application for anticipatory bail. The petitioner is

the second accused in Crime No.454 of 2012 of Mala Police Station

which is registered for offences punishable under sections 498A, 406

and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.        It was registered on a private

complaint filed as Crl.M.P.No.5610 of 2012 filed before the Judicial First

Class magistrate Court, Chalakkudy and forwarded for investigation

under section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The allegation

is that the petitioner who is the mother of the first accused along with

the first accused demanded dowry and tortured the defacto complainant

mentally and physically.     The further allegation is that they have

misappropriated gold ornaments and also cash of Rs.70,000/-.




            2. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

also the learned Public Prosecutor.




            3. The learned Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the

application.  Evidently, no injury has been sustained by the defacto

complainant.    Considering the nature of the accusation against the

petitioner and the fact that the petitioner is a lady aged 56 years I am

B.A.3136/2012                          2


inclined to dispose of this application as hereunder:-




          (a) The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

               Officer within seven days from today.


          (b) After interrogation, the petitioner shall be released on bail

              on her executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- with two solvent

              sureties for the like sum to the satisfaction of the

              Investigating Officer.


          (c) The petitioner shall report before the Investigating Officer

              between 10 a.m. and 12 a.m. on alternate Mondays for a

              period of three months commencing from 28.5.2012 and

              thereafter, as and when required by the Investigating

              Officer till the final report is filed.


          (d) The petitioner shall not interfere with the investigation or

              intimidate or influence the witnesses.        She shall not

              tamper or attempt to tamper, with the evidence.

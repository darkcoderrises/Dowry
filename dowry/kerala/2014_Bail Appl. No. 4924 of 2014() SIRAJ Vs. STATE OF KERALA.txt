                     B.A. No. 4924 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 8th day of July, 2014

                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   The petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.

578/2014 of Vadakkencherry Police Station, which has been

registered for offences under sections 341, 323, 324, 325

and 498A of IPC.

     3.    It is alleged that he, along with his mother-in-law

and sister-in-law who are 2nd and 3rd accused in the case,

subjected his wife (1st informant) to cruelty demanding more

dowry. On 2.4.2011, demanding more dowry, he assaulted

her and bit off a part of her right ear. But, because of the

intervention of certain well wishers, she rejoined him. But,

again in 2012, the accused started subjecting her to cruelty.

She left for her parents' home. But, she was compelled to

rejoin the petitioner.     But, thereafter also the accused

assaulted her even with dangerous weapons. It is then, she

approached the learned Magistrate with complaint.

B.A. No. 4924 of 2014
                                -2-



      4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   The case diary reveals that on 2.4.2011 the

petitioner was admitted to hospital with injuries. She has

lost a part of her right ear. Prima facie, the petitioner has

inflicted serious injuries to her.       The allegations in the

complaint indicate that he, along with the co-accused, have

committed all the offences alleged against them. It is not at

all proper to favour him with an order under section 438

Cr.P.C.

      In the result, this application is dismissed.

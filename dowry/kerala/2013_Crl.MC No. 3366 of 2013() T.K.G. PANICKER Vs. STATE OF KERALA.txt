                 -------------------------------
                Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 29th day of August, 2013.


                         O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in

C.C.No.106/2007 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Haripad, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No.37/CR/KLM/2008 of CBCID-

OCW-II, Kottayam Sub Unit of the CBCID] for the offences

punishable under Sections 467, 468, 471, 193, 34, 511 of

420 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-VI charge

sheet filed against the petitioners, as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2. The allegation against the petitioners who are

accused nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.106/07 is that the 1st

accused produced three forged documents as genuine, in

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                                  2

C.C.No.172/03 of the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-II, Harippad, and tried to prove with the

assistance of second accused that the forged documents

produced are genuine and thus made attempt to commit

cheating and get an illegal gain of `50,000/- and illegal loss

to the complainant, who is the plaintiff in the above

calendar case.         Thus according to the prosecution, the

accused committed the offences punishable under sections

467, 468, 471, 193, 511 and 420 r/w 34 of IPC. Now the

case of the petitioner is that the entire dispute with the 3rd

respondent is settled.

         3. It is also the case of the petitioner that when the

3rd respondent approached this Court by filing a writ

petition for an investigation by another agency in the above

crime and when the learned Single Judge of this Court

allowed      the     writ  petition ordering    crime   branch

investigation, the present petitioners, who are the

respondents therein, filed a writ appeal as W.A.No.1925/10,

which resulted in the dismissal of the appeal, vide

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                              3

Annexure-III judgment.     Again the very same appellants

preferred a review petition upon Annexure-III judgment,

which was disposed by Annexure-1 order, wherein a

Division Bench of this Court recorded that in the light of

the submission made by the counsel that the parties have

arrived into settlement. Accordingly observed that, "If that

be so, the Police also will be relieved of further

investigation in the matter. Thus the review petition was

disposed of directing the petitioner and complainants to

approach the Deputy Superintendent of Police in charge of

the investigation team, so that he could record the

settlement and close the matter in accordance with the

procedure       prescribed under the   Code     of  Criminal

Procedure".

         4. The present grievance of the petitioner is that in

spite of Annexure-I judgment, the Investigating Officer

proceeded further and filed a final report. As directed by

this Court, a statement has already been filed by the

Investigating Officer by producing Annexure R2(a) order of

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                             4

the Division Bench in I.A.No.584/11 in R.P.No.1108/10 in

W.A.No.1925/10 dated 20.3.2012, stating that the parties to

the dispute had not approached him. However, as the 3rd

respondent who is the de facto complainant sworn into an

affidavit dated 26.8.2013, stating that as the dispute is

settled between the parties, according to me, the

proceedings pending against the petitioners can be

quashed.

         5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 3rd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         6. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.         Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case/crime is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         7. The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                                5

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

         8.        I  have carefully considered   the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 467,

468, 471, 193, 34, 511 of 420 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                                    6

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 3rd respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                                   7

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

Crl.M.C.No.3366 of 2013
                               8

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - VI charge sheet and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.106/2007 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Haripad, [in Crime

No.37/CR/KLM/2008 of CBCID-OCW-II, Kottayam Sub Unit

of the CBCID].

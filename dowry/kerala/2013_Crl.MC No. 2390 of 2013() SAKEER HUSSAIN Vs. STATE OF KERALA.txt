                  Crl.M.C.No.2390 of 2013
             --------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 14th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.3 & 4 in C.C.No.55 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Sasthamkotta which is a case instituted upon the police report

in Crime No.283 of 2006 of Sasthamcotta Police Station for

the offences punishable under Sections 493, 420, 294(b) &

323 read with Section 34 of IPC with a prayer to quash

Annexure-I Charge against the petitioners in C.C.No.No.55 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Sasthamkotta as the matter is settled out of court.

    2.    The prosecution case is that, the first accused, in

furtherance of the common intention with accused Nos.2 to 5

made believe CW.1/the second respondent herein, who is the

de facto complainant that she is lawfully married to the first

Crl.M.C.No.2390/2013

                             :-2-:


petitioner and had sexual intercourse with her in that belief

with the knowledge that she is not lawfully married to him and

on 03/12/2004 the first accused with the dishonest intention to

deceive     CW1     obtained `3,46,000/-  from    the de   facto

complainant by selling landed property and also obtained four

sovereigns of gold. It is the further submission of the learned

counsel that, out of 5 accused A5 is no more, accused Nos.1

and 2 faced trial in C.C.No.1168 of 2006 and by judgment

dated 10/01/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Sasthamcotta, they are acquitted. The remaining accused i.e.,

accused Nos.3 and 4 are the petitioners herein.        It is the

further case of the petitioner that the dispute is compromised.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the

subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation

Crl.M.C.No.2390/2013

                              :-3-:


of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law

and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition which is

marked as Annexure-IV affidavit.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 493, 420, 294(b) &

323 read with Section 34 of IPC which are more or less

Crl.M.C.No.2390/2013

                                     :-4-:


personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

Crl.M.C.No.2390/2013

                                       :-5-:


         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

Crl.M.C.No.2390/2013

                             :-6-:


the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I charge and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in C.C.No.55 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamkotta.

           ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 11th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in Crime No.436/2009 of

Vatakara Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 452, 308 r/w Section 149

oof I.P.C. According to the petitioners accused Nos. A1, A2 and

A4 faced the prosecution in S.C.No.425/2011, and by

Annexure-AII judgment the learned Sessions Judge acquitted

them under Section 232 of IPC.

         2. The present case of the petitioner is that he is also

entitled to get the benefit of Annexure-AII judgment and

especially when the disputes between himself and the defacto

complainant who is the first respondent and the injured second

respondent are settled. Therefore, he preferred the above M.C

with a prayer to quash Annexure-I police charge and all

proceedings pending in L.P.No.67/2012 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vatakara.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
                               2

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4.   The case of the prosecution is that the accused

who are the activists of N.D.F shared with their common object

to commit the offence on account of enmity towards CW2 who

is an activists of A.B.V.P, formed an unlawful assembly in the

premises of his dwelling house at Kakkattil Nadakkunathozha

on 5/7/2009 around 8 p.m. armed with G.I. Pipe, wooden

reaper etc., and they trespassed into the said house and the

second accused blow CW2 with a wooden reaper and slapped

him, whereas the first accused blow CW1 the father of CW2

and they also assaulted CW3 the mother of CW2 with the

weapons carried by them. According to the prosecution all

these acts were done by the accused with the intention of

knowledge that if from their act has caused the death of CW2

all of them are guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder.

          5.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case it can be seen that though the accused

Nos. A1, A2 and A4 faced the prosecution, they were acquitted

by Annexure-A2 judgment and in the paragraph 12 of the said

Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
                                 3

judgment the learned Sessions Judge has found that after

considering the evidence of PWs 2 and 3 it appears that

neither of them has not identified that the accused as the

assailants of them, or they had a case that prior to the incident

they saw the accused in or near to the scene of crime. The

learned Sessions Judge has also found that mere presence of

A1, A2 and A4 at the place of occurrence or there participation

into the commission offence is not spoken by PWs. 1 to 3. It is

also found that by the learned Judge that it is come out from

the testimony that the grievance of the witnesses PW1 to 3

towards the accused are settled due to the intervention of

leaders and accordingly held that the prosecution evidence is

not capable to bring home the guilty of the accused punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 452, 308 r/w Section

149 of I.P.C. In view of Annexure 3 and 4 affidavit filed

respectively by the defacto complainant and the injured who

are respondents 1 and 2 in the above M.C., I am of the view

that there is no meaning in sending the petitioner to face the

prosecution and in the given circumstance no fruitful turn out

can be anticipated even if the trial is undertaken by the Court

below rather it will be resulted in sheer waste of judicial time.

                                4

          6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          7. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and they have no grievance against him.

          8. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          9.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324,

Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
                                     5

452, 308 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.            It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
                                      6

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Crl.M.C.No. 2835 of 2013
                                7

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in L.P.No. 67/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Vatakara and all further proceedings thereto.

                     ----------------------------------------
                         Crl.M.C.No. 4112 of 2014
                     ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 19th day of August, 2014

                                   O R D E R

                    The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No. 601/2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha           which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 1150/2013 of

Muvattupuzha Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

447,323,294(b),427 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

all further proceedings against the petitioners in pursuance of Annexure A

final report as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 30.6.2013 at about

3 p.m., the petitioners trespassed into the residential compound of the first

respondent and had caused damages to the windows of the residential

house which resulted in loss of `700/- and the petitioners had showered

abuses and pushed respondents 1 and 2 and thereby committed the

Crl.M.C.No. 4112 of 2014


                                     :-2-:

offences punishable Sections 447,323,294(b),427 read with Section 34 of

I.P.C. and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of

court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first and second respondents.         I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the respondents 1 and 2, who on the basis

of specific instruction received from the respondents, submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainants/injured do not intend to proceed

any further against the petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

Crl.M.C.No. 4112 of 2014


                                        :-3-:

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

447,323,294(b),427 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached

this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the respondents 2 and 3, it appears to me that the injured/the

de facto complainants have no further grievance against the petitioners/accused

in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

Crl.M.C.No. 4112 of 2014


                                           :-4-:

           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

Crl.M.C.No. 4112 of 2014


                                      :-5-:

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

proceedings against the petitioners in pursuance of Annexure A final report.

                                                                      Judge

                       Crl.M.C.No. 2273 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above Crl.M.C. is filed under Section 482 of

the Cr.P.C. at the instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in

C.C.No.18 of 2010 pending on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Thamarassery with a prayer to quash the entire

proceedings in C.C.No.18 of 2010 of the above court. The above

calendar case is instituted upon the report of the Police in Crime

No.469 of 2009 of the Thamarassery Police Station, which was

registered on the basis of the F.I.statement given by the de facto

complainant alleging that at 4 p.m. on 29.9.2009, the petitioners, who

are the accused, trespassed into the house of PW1 and physically

restrained him and assaulted the inmates of the house. Now, the case

of the petitioners is that the de facto complainant is no more, but the

case against the petitioners, who are the accused, is settled with the

Crl.M.C.No.2273 of 2013
                                :-2-:

legal heirs of the said de faco complainant and therefore, they pray

that all proceedings in C.C.No.18 of 2010 may be quashed.

         2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

counsel appearing for respondents 1 to 3 and the learned Public

Prosecutor for the State.

         3. To substantiate the above submission of learned counsel

for the petitioners, he invited my attention to Annexure A report in

C.C.No.18 of 2010, Annexure B F.I.R. In Crime No.469 of 2009 and

Annexure C death certificate issued from the Puthuppadi Grama

Panchayat with respect to the death of the de facto complainant,

Annexure D, a copy of the family membership certificate issued by

the Puthuppadi Village and Annexure E affidavit sworn by

respondents 1 to 3 and Annexure F affidavit sworn by respondents 1

to 3.

         4.     Learned counsel for respondents 1 to 3 submitted

especially in the light of the affidavit referred to above, that the

Crl.M.C.No.2273 of 2013
                                         :-3-:

respondents, who are the legal heirs of the de facto complainant, have

no objection in dropping the proceedings pending against the

petitioners. Going by the allegation against the accused, it can be seen

that the accused entered into the house of the de facto complainant

and restrained him and assaulted the inmates.                           As the dispute

between the petitioners and the legal heirs of the de facto complainant

has been settled, I am of the view that the decision reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108] is attracted in the

present case, wherein it has been held as follows:-

         "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be

         summarised thus:     the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

Crl.M.C.No.2273 of 2013
                                                :-4-:

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

             case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

             injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

             despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim........"


             In the result, following the dictum laid therein, this Crl.M.C.

is allowed quashing all proceedings pending against the petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.2273 of 2013
                             :-5-:

Court-I, Thamarassery.

              ---------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No. 973 of 2015
              ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015

                             ORDER

     Petitioners are accused in C.C. No. 476/2014 on the file of

the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod in Crime No.

989/2013 of Kasargode Police Station. The learned Magistrate

took cognizance of the offences under Sections 341,447,324,354

and 326 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, based on a

private complaint filed by the first respondent. Now, it is

submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the respondents 1 and 2 has

already been settled and the respondents 1 and 2 have sworn to

affidavits which are produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexures C

and D. Therefore, the prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash the

entire proceedings in C.C. No. 476/2014 on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod in Crime No. 989/2013 of

Kasargode Police Station.

     2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

counsel for the    respondents 1 and 2 and the learned Public

Crl.M.C. No. 973 of 2015              2

Prosecutor appearing for the third respondent.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power

is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

Crl.M.C. No. 973 of 2015           3

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand

on a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out

of matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes

where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and

the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these

categories of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings,

if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender

and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is remote and

bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to

great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

Crl.M.C. No. 973 of 2015             4

caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair

or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have committed offences under Sections 341,447,324,354 and

326 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

     5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the respondents 1 and 2 has

already been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the

respondents 1 and 2 has also stated that the respondents 1 and

2 do not want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the

Crl.M.C. No. 973 of 2015            5

petitioners. The respondents 1 and 2 have also sworn to an

affidavit before this Court as Annexures C and D in this regard.

      6.   In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C. No.

476/2014 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod in Crime No. 989/2013 of Kasargode Police Station

can be quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the

principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case

(supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C. No. 476/2014 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod in Crime No. 989/2013 of

Kasargode Police Station against the petitioners are quashed.

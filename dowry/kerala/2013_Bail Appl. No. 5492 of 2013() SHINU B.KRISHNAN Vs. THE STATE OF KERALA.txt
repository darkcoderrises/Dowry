                     -------------------------------
                    B.A.No.5492 OF 2013 ()
                     --------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                              O R D E R
                             ~~~~~~~


      Petitioner are the accused in Crime No.549 of 2013 of

Varkala Police Station registered for offences punishable under

Sections 498A, 406, 323, 324, 354, 342 and 294(b) read with 34

of Indian Penal Code. They have moved the above application

seeking pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code').

      2.    Crime was registered on a complaint filed by the wife

of first petitioner against him and his parents, second and third

petitioners, imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment both

physical and mental to her by all of them. She was subjected to

incessant torture with demand for dowry and on one occasion

even her mother was ill-treated by the husband, is her case.

Investigation of the crime is now in progress.

      3.    Notice was ordered to de facto complainant. She

entered appearance through a counsel. De facto complainant

was ordered to be impleaded as additional second respondent.

B.A.No.5492/2013                  2


      4.    I heard learned counsel for petitioners, learned

counsel for additional second respondent and also learned Public

Prosecutor.

      5.    Allegations imputed against petitioners to prosecute

them for the offences stated are totally false and the wife wanted

to live separately with her husband and child leaving his parents,

for which he was not amenable, is the submission of counsel for

petitioners.    Petitioners are prepared to co-operate with the

investigation of crime is the further submission of counsel to

urge for granting them pre-arrest bail. Opposing the application

learned counsel for second respondent submitted that de facto

complainant suffered inhuman torture and cruelty at the hands

of all the petitioners and this is not a fit case where they can be

granted pre-arrest bail invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of

this Court.     Learned Public Prosecutor also submitted that

materials gathered by investigating agency so far disclose

complicity of at least first petitioner, husband, in the cruelties

inflicted on his wife and as such he is not entitled to pre-arrest

bail.

B.A.No.5492/2013                 3


      6.    Case Diary has been produced for my perusal. After

looking into the materials covered by Case Diary with reference

to the submissions made by counsel on both sides and taking

note of the facts and circumstances presented in the case, I find

reason to suspect complicity of first petitioner, husband, in the

ill-treatment   and    harassment   alleged   against   de   facto

complainant, and as such the discretionary relief canvassed of

cannot be extended to him.       So far as the second and third

petitioners, his parents, who are shown to be pretty aged, I find,

they can be granted anticipatory bail with direction to co-operate

with the investigation of crime.

      Petition is disposed as hereunder.

      In the event of his arrest of second and third petitioners,

parents of first petitioner - husband in the crime, it is ordered

that they shall be released on executing bond for Rs.10,000/-

each with one solvent surety for the like sum. Petitioners 2 and 3

have to co-operate with the investigation and also report before

the investigating officer if their presence is demanded for

smooth completion of investigation.

B.A.No.5492/2013                 4


     Anticipatory bail is declined to first petitioner, husband,

but, with direction enabling him to appear before the

investigating officer and co-operate with the investigation. In

case first petitioner appear before investigating officer at 10.a.m.

on 19.9.2013 after his interrogation, in the event of his arrest in

the crime, he shall be produced before the magistrate without

delay. On such production, application for bail, if any, moved by

first petitioner with advance notice to Assistant public

Prosecutor also, shall be considered by the magistrate and

disposed on its merits in accordance with law.

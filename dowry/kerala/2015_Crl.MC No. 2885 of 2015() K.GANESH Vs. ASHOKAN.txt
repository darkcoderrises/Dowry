               -------------------------------------
            Dated this the 19th day of May, 2015

                             ORDER


      The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime

No.418/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station now pending as

C.C.No.3165/2013, on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod.     The above crime was

registered against the petitioners on a complaint filed by

the 1st respondent alleging offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323, 324 r/w 34 IPC. Now the grievances of

the petitioners are that the parties have settled the matter

and the 1st respondent does not want to proceed with this

prosecution against the petitioners.      Since the alleged

offences are non compoundable offences,       the petitioners

and the 1st respondent could not settle and withdraw the

matter. Thus the petitioners have no alternative other than

approaching this court invoking inherent jurisdiction under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.           The

learned counsel for the petitioners prayed for quashing the

Crl.M.C.No.2885 OF 2015          2

entire proceedings against the petitioners under Annexure

A1 final report. In support of the prayer the 1st respondent

has filed an affidavit stating that averments in the petition

are true and correct.        The learned counsel for the 1st

respondent submits that the 1st respondent does not want to

proceed with the prosecution against the petitioners. The

learned counsel for the petitioners drew my attention to the

decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108 (SC)] in support of the averments in this

Crl.M.C.

      2. I have meticulously considered the decision laid

down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT

108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the

Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question

whether the High Court has power to quash criminal

proceedings involving non-compoundable offences on the

basis of the compromise reached between the offender and

the victim and answered as given below:

            "57.   The position that emerges from the

            above discussion can be summarised thus:

Crl.M.C.No.2885 OF 2015           3

            the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

            exercise of   its inherent jurisdiction is

            distinct and different from the power given

            to a criminal court for compounding the

            offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent

            power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in

            accord with the guideline engrafted in such

            power viz;(1) to secure the ends of justice

            or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

            any Court. In what cases power to quash

            the criminal proceeding or complaint or

            F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender

            and victim have settled their dispute would

            depend on the facts and circumstances of

            each    case  and   no    category can    be

            prescribed.   However, before exercise of

            such power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of the

            crime.    Heinous and serious offences of

            mental depravity or offences like murder,

            rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

            quashed even though the victim or victim's

            family and the offender have settled the

            dispute. Such offences are not private in

            nature and have serious impact on society.

            Similarly, any compromise between the

Crl.M.C.No.2885 OF 2015            4

            victim and offender in relation to the

            offences    under    special   statutes   like

            Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences

            committed by public servants while working

            in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any

            basis for quashing criminal proceedings

            involving such offences.      But the criminal

            cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

            footing for the purposes of quashing,

            particularly   the   offences   arising  from

            commercial,     financial,  mercantile,  civil,

            partnership or such like transactions or the

            offences arising out of matrimony relating

            to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where

            the wrong is basically private or personal in

            nature and the parties have resolved their

            entire dispute. In this category of cases,

            High Court may quash criminal proceedings

            if in its view, because of the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

            and continuation of criminal case would put

            accused to great oppression and prejudice

            and extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal case

            despite full and complete settlement and

            compromise with the victim. In other

Crl.M.C.No.2885 OF 2015           5

            words, the    High   Court   must   consider

            whether it would be unfair or contrary to

            the interest of justice to continue with the

            criminal proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal proceeding would tantamount to

            abuse of process of law despite settlement

            and compromise between the victim and

            wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

            of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

            case is put to an end and if the answer to

            the above question(s) is in affirmative, the

            High   Court   shall  be   well  within   its

            jurisdiction  to     quash   the    criminal

            proceeding."

     3. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is, whether

the non-compoundable offence involved in this case can be

compounded, in the exercise of the inherent power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prima facie,

I find that the offences alleged against the petitioners will

not come under the category of non-compoundable

offences, which are specifically excluded from composition,

in the exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C.     Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.2885 OF 2015        6

complainant, it is seen that the dispute between the

accused and the victim had been amicably settled and, at

present, the de facto complainant has no subsisting

grievance at all. The de facto complainant does not want to

proceed with prosecution against the accused.      In view of

the compromise between the petitioner and the victim, I

find that the possibility of conviction is remote, bleak and

continuation of the criminal case would, put the parties to

great oppression, prejudice and also tantamount to abuse of

the process of the court.   The present criminal prosecution

against the accused must be put to an end to secure the

interest of justice.

     4. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings against

the petitioner under Annexure-A1 final report will stand

quashed.

     This Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.

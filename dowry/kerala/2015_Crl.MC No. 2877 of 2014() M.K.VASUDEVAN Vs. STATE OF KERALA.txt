                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 2877 of 2014
            =======================
           Dated this the 11th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused Nos.2 and 3 in Crime No.705 of

2012 of the Pathanamthitta Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A2 Final Report in

Crime No.705/2012 of the Pathanamthitta Police Station and all

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.204 of 2012 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Pathanamthitta, as

against these petitioners, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the first accused, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 2877 of 2014
                                  2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled through a mediation settlement agreement and

presently the defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners     and,   therefore, the   proceedings    against    the

petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     It seems that all matters in dispute between her and

the petitioners have been amicably settled through a mediation

settlement agreement and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all proceedings in the matter

referred to above, as against these petitioners, can be quashed.

She has entered appearance through her counsel.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

Crl.M.C. No. 2877 of 2014
                                3

above, as against these petitioners.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A2

Final Report in Crime No.705/2012 of the Pathanamthitta Police

Station and all proceedings based on it in C.C.No.204 of 2012

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Pathanamthitta, as against these petitioners, are hereby

quashed.

                                  B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

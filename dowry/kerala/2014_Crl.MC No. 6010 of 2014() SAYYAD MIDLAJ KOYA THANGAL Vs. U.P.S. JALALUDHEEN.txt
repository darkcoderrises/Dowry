                       ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                    ==================
                      Crl.M.C.No. 6010 of 2014
                    ==================
            Dated this the 24th day of October, 2014
                              O R D E R

      The petitioners herein are the four accused in the impugned

Crime No.730/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station, Kasargod. The

Police,   after   investigation   submitted     Annexure-A1     final

report/charge sheet in the impugned crime, which led to the

institution of C.C.No. 2279/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasargod. The gist of the prosecution

allegations is that before and after 7.3.2012, the accused had

suppressed some facts from the 1st respondent and married the 1st

respondent's daughter and obtained dowry and thereby the

petitioners committed offences punishable under Secs. 406, 417,

420 read with Sec. 34 of the IPC. It is stated that now the entire

disputes between the petitioners and the 1st respondent have been

settled out of court and that the 1st respondent and his daughter are

not interested to continue with the impugned criminal proceedings.

The 1st respondent, who is the defacto complainant, has sworn to

affidavit dated 20.10.2014 stating the above aspects and also

stating that the entire disputes between the petitioners and the 1st

CRL.M.C.6010/14                  - : 2 :-

respondent have been amicably settled due to mediation of

respectful persons and that the 1st respondent is not interested to

continue with the impugned criminal proceedings and that he has

no grievance against the petitioners and that he has no objection to

quash the impugned criminal proceedings against the accused in

the impugned Crime No.730/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station,

which has led to the institution of the Calendar Case, C.C.No.

2279/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-

I, Kasargod. It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances, that the instant Criminal Miscellaneous Case has

been filed with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-A1

final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime No.730/2012 of

Vidyanagar Police Station, which has led to the institution of C.C.No.

2279/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-

I, Kasargod, and all further proceedings arising therefrom.

      2.     The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.Siju Mathew,

Advocate has taken notice for the 1st respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 2nd respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.     Heard Sri.T.B.Shajimon, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners, Sri.Siju Mathew, learned counsel appearing for R1

CRL.M.C.6010/14                  - : 3 :-

and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 2nd respondent-

State.

      4.     The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that   during   the   pendency    of     the aforementioned   criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, which has resulted in the subject matter of the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money and would unnecessarily strain the judicial, administrative

and financial resources of the State.

      5.     The learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent has

submitted on the basis of the specific instructions furnished by the

1st respondent that the 1st respondent has amicably settled the

disputes with the petitioners and that he has no objection in the

quashment of      the impugned criminal proceedings and that the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners as he has no grievance against the

CRL.M.C.6010/14                   - : 4 :-

petitioners and that he will not raise any dispute/compliant in future

if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is allowed.

      6.     The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who also

has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this Court

may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law well

settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.     After having carefully considered the submissions of the

parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen that

the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved, the

real disputants to the controversy which has led to the impugned

criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an amicable

settlement of the matter. From the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the 1st respondent, it is clear to the court that

the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

at by them. In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 =

CRL.M.C.6010/14                          - : 5 :-

2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as

follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

        can be"61.     The position that emerges from the above discussion
                  summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing
        a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
        inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given
        to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of
        the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
        engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
        to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power
        to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
        exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
        would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
        category can be prescribed.."

It is further held as follows:-

        "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
        dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
        purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
        commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
        transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
        dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
        private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
        criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
        between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
        remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
        accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
        wouldand caused to himsettlement
                  be               by not quashing the criminal case despite
        full
        victim........"complete                  and compromise    with  the


In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others v. The

State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8) SCALE 634 = III

(2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC), the Apex Court has

held as follows:

                 "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are

CRL.M.C.6010/14                         - : 6 :-

      entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public peace
      or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such proceedings on
      account of compromise would bring about peace and would secure
      ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case involving

offences under Secs. 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w Sec. 34 Indian

Penal Code.

      8.     Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, it

is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have arisen

consequent to the personal disputes between the disputants and

the disputes have been settled amicably between the parties.

Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,

the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions of the

Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which has led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

CRL.M.C.6010/14                   - : 7 :-

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer wastage of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount to

abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger sense.

Hence, following the decisions of the Apex Court cited supra, this

Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by

granting the prayers sought for.

      9.     In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-AI final report/charge sheet in the impugned Crime No.

730/2012 of Vidyanagar Police Station, which has led to the

pendency of Calendar Case, C.C.No. 2279/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasargod and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners shall

produce certified copies of this order before the court below

concerned as well as before the Station House Officer, Vidyanagar

Police Station.

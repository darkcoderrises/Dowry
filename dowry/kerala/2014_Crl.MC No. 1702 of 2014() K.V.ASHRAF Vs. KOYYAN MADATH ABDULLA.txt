     ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014
     ==============================
         Dated this, the 25th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 3 in

C.C.No.504/12 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannur to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners were

the original accused Nos.2, 4 and 5 in Crime No.12/05 of

Pazhayangadi Police Station which was registered on the basis

of the statement given by the first respondent herein against

the petitioners and others alleging offences under Sections

143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 read with Section 149 of Indian

Penal Code. After investigation, Annexure A1 final report was

filed originally against the five accused persons including the

present petitioners before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannur and it was taken on file as C.C.No.253/05.

Since the present petitioners did not appear, the case against

first and third accused alone was proceeded with and they were

acquitted after trial and case against the present petitioners

was split up and refiled as C.C.No.504/12 and now pending

Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014       : 2 :

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur.

Now, the matter has been settled between the parties. They

are neighbours and harmony has been restored on account of

the settlement. The de facto complainant does not want to

proceed with the prosecution against the petitioners.         Since

some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they

could not file the application before the court below for

compounding.         So, they have no other option except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

            "It is humbly prayed that the Crl.M.C. may be

     allowed and Annexure I Final Report and all further

     proceedings in C.C.504/2012 on the file of Judicial First

     Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur in Crime No.12/2005

     of Pazhayangadi police station may kindly be quashed for

     the interest of justice"



      3.     First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and first respondent does not want to proceed against

the present petitioners as accused Nos.1 and 3 were already

acquitted by the court after trial. He filed an affidavit to that

effect as well. The Counsel for the petitioners submitted that

in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served in

Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014      :  3 :

proceeding with the case.     So, he prayed for allowing the

application.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioners and they have no criminal background

but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that in respect of the incident

happened on 09.01.2005, a crime was registered as Crime

No.12/2005 of Pazhayangadi Police Station on the basis of the

statement given by the first respondent herein as de facto

complainant against five accused persons including the present

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148,

341, 323, 324 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed and the

same was originally taken as file as C.C.No.253/05 against all

the accused persons including the petitioners.          Since the

petitioners did not appear before the court below, the original

case was proceeded against accused Nos.1 and 3 alone and

after trial, they were acquitted by that court and the case

against the present petitioners was split up and refiled as

C.C.No.504/12 and that is pending before that court now.

Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014          :  4 :

Now, the case has been settled between the de facto

complainant and the petitioners. They are neighbours and the

matter has been settled due to the intervention of local people

and well wishers of both parties.           Further, the case against

accused Nos.1 and 3 was already ended in acquittal as well.

In view of the settlement, there is no possibility for the de

facto complainant and others supporting the case of the

prosecution and possibility of conviction against the petitioners

is remote. Allowing the prosecution to continue in such

circumstances will only amount to wastage of judicial time.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

           "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
    be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
    criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
    inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
    given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
    S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
    statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
    guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
    justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
    what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
    or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
    settled  their    dispute  would   depend    on  the   facts  and
    circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
    However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
    have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
    Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
    like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
    even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
    settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
    have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014          :   5 :

    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
    offences committed by public servants while working in that
    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
    proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
    having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
    on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
    the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
    partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
    of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
    where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
    the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
    of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
    view, because of the compromise between the offender and
    victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
    continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
    oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
    caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
    complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
    words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
    or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
    and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
    whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
    criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
    question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
    its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




         7.      In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the petitioners and

the first respondent were neighbours and persons belonging to

the same locality and the matter has been settled due to the

intervention of mediators and there is no possibility of

conviction and the case against other accused persons has

already been ended acquittal, this court feels that no purpose

will be served in proceeding with the case and it is a fit case

Crl.M.C.No.1702 of 2014     :   6 :

where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to

promote the settlement arrived at between the parties which

restored their relationship.

       So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.504/12 (Crime No.12/05 of Pazhayangadi Police

Station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannur as against the petitioners is quashed. Office

is directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

for necessary further action in this regard.

                  Crl.M.C. No. 1601 of 2014
                ---------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 19th March, 2014

                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.

No. 86/2011 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court

No- I, Kannur to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are accused

Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No. 289/2010 of Kannapuram police station

which was registered on the basis of the statement given by the

first respondent as de facto complainant alleging offences under

Sections 341, 323, 324 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code evidenced by Annexure I.                  After investigation final report

has been filed and that was taken on file as C.C.No.86/2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Kannur and

it is pending before that Court. The matter                       has been settled

between      the petitioners, de facto                complainant      and other

injured persons, who are shown as respondents 1 to 3 and they

have filed Annexure         II to IV affidavits in support of the same.

Crl.M.C. No. 1601 of 2014
                                     2

There is no possibility of any conviction in view of the settlement

and no purpose will be served by allowing the case to continue

as well. Since some of the offences are        non-compoundable in

nature, they could file application for compounding before the

court below.      So they have no option except to approach this

Court seeking the following reliefs:

                "Therefore it is humbly prayed that the

                Crl.M.C. may be allowed and Annexure I FIR &

                police charge and all further proceedings in

                C.C. 86/2011     on the file of JFCM-I Court,

                Kannur in Crime No.289/2010 of Kannapuram

                police station may kindly be quashed for the

                interest of justice".

      3.    Respondents 1 to       3  appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and they have no intention to prosecute the case in view of the

settlement arrived at due to intervention of well-wishers of both

parties and they have filed affidavits to that effect as well. The

counsel for the petitioners submits that in view of the settlement,

no purpose will be served in proceeding with the case.

      4.    The learned Public Prosecutor,      on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

Crl.M.C. No. 1601 of 2014
                                  3

against the petitioners and they have no criminal antecedents as

well    but opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the first respondent herein as de facto complainant,

Annexure 1 crime was registered as         Crime No 289/2010 of

Kannapuram Police Station and after investigation final report

was filed and is pending as C.C.No.86/2011 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur. The matter has

been     settled      between the parties,  which is evident from

Annexure II to IV affidavits filed by respondents 1 to 3, who are

the de facto complainant and other injured persons in the case. It

is mentioned in affidavits that the matter has been settled due

to the intervention of mediators and adequate compensation

has been paid as well. So they do not want to proceed with the

case. Since the matter has been settled between the parties

due to the intervention of mediators and well wishers of both

parties, there is no possibility of any conviction being entered in

the matter as         they are not going to support the case of

prosecution.

Crl.M.C. No. 1601 of 2014
                                        4

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
      be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
      criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
      guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
      justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
      what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
      or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
      settled   their   dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
      However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
      have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
      Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
      like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
      even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
      settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
      proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
      having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
      the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
      of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
      the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
      words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair

Crl.M.C. No. 1601 of 2014
                                        5

      or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
      criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
      its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of mediators and

good relationship has been restored             between the parties and

possibility of conviction is remote in view of the settlement, this

Court feels that no purpose will be served in proceeding with

the case as it will amount to wastage of judicial time alone and it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the Code

can be invoked to quash the proceeding.

      8. So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No. 86/2011 (Crime No. 289/10 of Kannapuram Police Station)

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Kannur

as against the petitioners is quashed.

        Office is     directed to communicate  this order to the

concerned court for further action immediately.

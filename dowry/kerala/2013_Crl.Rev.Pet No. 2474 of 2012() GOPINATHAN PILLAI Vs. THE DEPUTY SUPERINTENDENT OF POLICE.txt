                              ORDER


      Revision Petitioner is the Petitioner in C.M.P.No.3383/2012

in C.P.104/2011 in Crime No.128/2006 of Kurathikadu Police

Station pending before the Court of Judicial Magistrate of First

Class-I, Mavelikara. The above application was filed by the

father of one deceased Girijakumary, who is alleged to have

been murdered by poisoning at the hands of her husband and

relatives. The application was filed seeking further investigation

of the case Under Section 173 (8) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2. According to the averments in the petition, a proper

investigation was not conducted by the investigating officer. It is

alleged that no investigation was made regarding the gold

ornaments given by him to the deceased Girijakumary at the

time of her marriage. According to the petitioner, those gold

ornaments were misappropriated by the accused persons. The

first accused had misappropriated the said gold ornaments and

CRRP 2474/2012                  2

he handed over some gold ornaments to the 4th accused, who in

turn pledged those ornaments for his personal purposes. These

ornaments were not recovered        by the investigating officer

during the course of investigation. Further, it is averred that

the investigating officer has not conducted any investigation

regarding the allegation that the 4th accused has made an active

role for murdering the deceased Girijakumary. On the above

premise,    the Revision    Petitioner  sought   for  a   further

investigation, which is absolutely necessary in the above said

crime.

     3. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor has produced a

report received by him from the Dy.S.P.CBCID, Kollam and also

produced the entire C.D.file for perusal of the court below. In

this Revision Petition, the Deputy Superintendent of Police,

C.B.C.I.D.HHW-1, Kollam has filed a statement. In addition to

this as per the specific direction of this court, the said officer

has filed an additional statement explaining details of the gold

ornaments seized during the course of investigation.

     4. Going by the impugned order under challenge, it could

be seen that the learned Magistrate has perused the report

received from Deputy Superintendent of Police,C.B.CID, Kollam

CRRP 2474/2012                 3

and voluminous of C.D.file.  The learned Magistrate found that

there are no sufficient grounds warranting an order for further

investigation. In the report, the Dy.S.P. has stated that seven

sovereigns of gold ornaments were seized during the course of

investigation and handed over to the petitioner herein. The main

grievance projected in this petition is that the remaining gold

ornaments could not be recovered during the investigation. A

sum of Rs.1,00,000/- allegedly given by the petitioner herein to

the accused could not be found. As per the report, ultimately the

investigating officer came to the conclusion that the deceased

Girijakumary    was was murdered      by the first accused and

accused 2 to 4 subjected       her to cruelty and all accused

committed criminal acts in furtherance of their common

intention to do away the deceased Girijakumary.

     5. The learned Magistrate after considering the report and

case diary arrived on a finding that the investigation in this

crime was essentially for finding out whether the petitioner's

daughter Girijakumary was murdered by the accused and also

whether she was subjected to cruelty punishable under section

498-A. The return of gold ornaments and dowry amount said to

have been given at the time of marriage is, in fact, not the duty

CRRP 2474/2012                   4

of the investigating officer in this crime at this stage. Similarly,

the complaint that some more gold ornaments are yet to be

recovered is not a ground to order further investigation in a

murder case. I am of the opinion that the findings of the learned

Magistrate is correct and not liable to be interfered invoking

revisional jurisdiction of this court under Sections 397 and 401

of Cr.P.C.

      6.   Going by Section 173(8)of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, further investigation is permissible only when the

Investigating   Officer   obtains    further   evidence   oral   or

documentary. Needless to say that u/s 216 of Cr.P.C. during the

course of trial, the trial court has ample power to alter the

charge at any time before Judgment is pronounced and to make

more persons as accused invoking power under Section 319 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the Crl. Revision

Petition is devoid of merit.

      In the result, this Criminal Revision petition is dismissed

accordingly.

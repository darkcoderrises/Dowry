           Dated this the 30th day of October, 2014.

                             O R D E R



      The four petitioners herein are the accused Nos.1 to 4 in

Crime No.184/2012 of Kunnamkulam Police Station, Thrissur

District registered for offences alleged under Section 341, 324,

308, 506(1), 294(b) r/w 34 Indian Penal Code. The gist of the

prosecution allegation is that on 6.2.2012 at about 12:00 noon

due to the continued love affair that existed between the

defacto complainant (2nd respondent herein) and the daughter

of Accused No.2 (who is also the sister of A1), the 2nd

respondent was asked to come to Keattol Centre by the

petitioners over mobile phone and that when the 2nd

respondent-defacto complainant reached the Keattol Centre,

the petitioners came in motor cycles and attacked the defacto

complainant and they inflicted injuries to the defacto

complainant.    Annexure-A1 is the copy of the FIR in Crime

No.184/2012 of Kunnmkulam Police Station registered on

7.2.2012.      The police after investigation submitted the

impugned Annexure-A2 Final Report in the impugned Crime

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

No.184/2012 of Kunnamkulam Police Station on 30.7.2012

which led to the institution of committal proceedings,

C.P.No.41/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Kunnamkulam.       It is stated that all the disputes

between the petitioners and the 2nd respondent (defacto

complainant) have been amicably resolved and thereafter

accused No.2 (father of the girl) took steps to conduct the

marriage of his daughter with the defacto complainant and the

said couple are living together as husband and wife. The 2nd

respondent-defacto complainant has sworn to affidavit dated

31.8.2014 produced as Annexure-A3 in this Crl.M.C stating the

above aspects and particularly stating that on account of the

intervention of well wishers, the entire disputes between the

parties have been amicably settled and that the parties are

residing nearby and in view of the settlement, there is no need

to continue the impugned criminal proceedings any further and

that he has no surviving grievance in the matter and has no

objection in the quashment of the proceedings etc. It is in the

light of the facts and circumstances, that the aforementioned

Crl.M.C has been filed with the prayer to quash the impugned

                                ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

Annexure-A2 Final Report/Charge Sheet in the impugned

Crime No.184/2012 of Kunnamkulam Police Station which has

led to the pendency of C.P.No.41/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam etc.

      2.    The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.P.A.Girish

Kumar, Advocate, has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and

the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.    Heard Sri.Yash Thomas Mannully, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.P.A.Girish Kumar, learned

counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent and the learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

      4.    The learned     counsel   for  the petitioners has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

                                ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.P.A.Girish Kumar, learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the

petitioners and that he has no objection in the quashment of

the    impugned     criminal     proceedings   and     that   the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners as he has no grievance against

them and that they will not raise any dispute/complaint in

future if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is

allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

                                   ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for the 2nd

respondent,      it    is   clear     to    the     Court     that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

            "61.    The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may     quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
       public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
       such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
       about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
       hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

                               ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.5513 Of 2014

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and in the interest of

justice, it is ordered that the impugned Annexure-A2 Final

Report/Charge Sheet       filed  in in the impugned Crime

No.184/2012 of Kunnamkulam Police Station which has led to

the pendency of C.P.No.41/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam and all proceedings

arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioner shall forward

certified copies of this order to the Station House Officer

concerned as well as to the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned.

                   B.A. No. 8101 of 2014
         ---------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 20th day of December 2014


                           O R D E R


           Accused in Crime No.1713 of 2014 of Vaikom

Police Station was filed this application for anticipatory bail

under Section 438        of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter referred to as 'the Code' for short).

     2.    The case of the prosecution in nut shell was that

the petitioner married the de facto complainant on 08.07.2001

and thereafter, she was subjected to cruelty demanding more

dowry and thereby, he had committed the offence puishable

under Section 498(A) of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Heard both sides and perused the records.

     4.    It is seen from the records that the above case was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the de facto

complainant alleging commission of the above said offence. It

is also seen from the statement of facts that earlier on the

basis of similar allegations, a case was registered and after

investigation, it was taken on file as C.C No. 216 of 2008 and

the matter was settled between the parties and they are

started residing together and it is thereafter, that the present

complaint has been filed after five years of that incident.

B.A. No. 8101 of 2014
                                 2

However, I am not at this stage going to the genuineness of

the allegation made. Being a matrimonial dispute and also

considering the allegations made, the custodial interrogation

of the petitioner is not required and putting the spouse behind

the bar is likely to affect the possibility of settlement in future

as well. So considering the circumstances, this Court feels

that anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner in the

above case with some conditions. So the petition is allowed

with following conditions:

           1.  Petitioner if arrested in connection with

           Crime No. 1713 of 2014 of Vaikom Police

           Station, is directed to be released on bail on

           executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees

           Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent

           sureties each for the like sum to the

           satisfaction       of      the        arresting

           officer/investigating officer/Station House

           Officer of the concerned Police Station as

           the case may be.

           2.    Petitioner shall appear before the

           Investigating Officer for the purpose of

           interrogation for three consecutive days

           between     9.00   a.m    and    12.00    noon

           immediately after such arrest and release

           and thereafter, as and when required by him

           in writing to do so, till the final report is

B.A. No. 8101 of 2014
                                 3

           filed.

           3.    Petitioner shall not leave the State of

           Kerala without getting prior permission from

           the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Vaikom, till the disposal of the case and he

           shall surrender his passport either before

           the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Vaikom or before the Investigating Officer at

           the time of his arrest and move for regular

           bail.

           4.    If the petitioner surrenders before the

           Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Vaikom, and moves for regular bail, then

           the learned Magistrate is directed to release

           the petitioner on bail on the same conditions

           as stated above.

            With the above conditions, the anticipatory bail

application is allowed.

                  CRL. M.C. No.6547 of 2014
           ...............................................................
           Dated this the 8th day of December, 2014

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A5 in Crime No.227/2014 of the

Ollur Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A3 final report in

Crime No.227/2014 of Ollur Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.1426/2014 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-III, Thrissur,

quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.6547 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     3rd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.6547 of 2014
                               -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 3rd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A3

final report in Crime No.227/2014 of the Ollur Police Station

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.1426/2014

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-III,

Thrissur, are hereby quashed.

                       B.A No.7634 of 2012
                ---------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 17th day of October, 2012

                             O R D E R

      The petitioners are the accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime

No.1494/2012 of Adoor Police Station, for having committed

offence punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 IPC.

      2.   The marriage between the 1st petitioner and the

defacto complainant took place on 5.1.2012 and according to the

allegation soon after the marriage the 1st petitioner harassed the

defacto complainant demanding more dowry and treated her

very cruelly. The further allegation is that she was sent to her

matrimonial house by the 1st petitioner.

      3.   A copy of the complaint produced along with the

petition, in which several serious allegations made against the 1st

petitioner.

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out

that the allegations are totally false. The petitioners are totally

innocent. Therefore they seek pre-arrest bail.

      5.   The learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the 2nd

petitioner who was initially arrayed as an accused, was deleted

B.A No.7634 of 2012              : 2:

from the party array.

     6.    Going by the allegations in the complaint it is difficult

to accept the claim of the petitioners that they are innocent and

false allegations are made against them. In fact very serious

allegations made against them. A probe into the question of

veracity does not arise for consideration. Suffice to say that it is

not a fit case, where extraordinary jurisdiction needs to be

exercised in favour of the 1st petitioner.

     The petition is accordingly dismissed.

        --------------------------------------------------
               Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
        --------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 19th day of August, 2013


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused nos. 1 to 3 in

C.C.No.518/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Kolenchery, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No. 316 of 2011 of Chottanikkara

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

120(B), 403, 417, 418, 420, 471, 465, 468 & 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash all further proceedings against the

petitioners as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The gist of the allegation is that the petitioners

herein had forged the deed of partnership and a letter of

City Electricals, Market Road, Piravom, a proprietary

concern of the 1st respondent herein and had received an

amount of  1,36,512/- from Chottanikkara Grama

Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
                              ..2..

Panchayath, which is due to the 1st respondent herein and

now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court.

       3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the learned counsel for the 1st respondent. I have

also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

       4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute,

which is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore,

the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

       5. According to the prosecution, the accused have

committed the offences punishable under Sections 120

(B), 403, 417, 418, 420, 471, 465, 468 & 34 of I.P.C. The

case of the petitioners is that the entire dispute is settled

between the petitioners and the 1st respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, who had sworn into Annexure C

affidavit.

          6.    The learned counsel for the 1st respondent,

Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
                                ..3..

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

       7.     I   have    carefully  considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

       8.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 120

(B), 403, 417, 418, 420, 471, 465, 468 & 34 of I.P.C.,

which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
                                     ..4..

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57.  The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:             the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the    power    given  to    a  criminal     court   for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

          Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

          statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

          accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

          viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases

          power     to quash the criminal proceeding            or

          complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the

          offender and victim have settled their dispute would

          depend on the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
                                    ..5..

          ".........  But   the    criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its

          view, because of the compromise between the

          offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

          remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

          would put accused to great oppression and

          prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

          and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"


          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances           involved    in    the    present      case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

Crl. M.C. No. 3456 of 2013
                               ..6..

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event

of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.

518 of 2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kolenchery and all further proceedings thereto.

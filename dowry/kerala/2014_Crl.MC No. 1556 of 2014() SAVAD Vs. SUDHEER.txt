                     --------------------------
                      Crl.M.C 1556 of 2014
                      --------------------------
             Dated this the 17th day of March, 2014

                            O R D E R

      This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1 to 6 in

CC 2000/2013 (Crime No.187/2013 of Mannanchery Police

Station) to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

private complaint filed by the first respondent before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Alappuzha, which was

forwarded to the Police, Annexure 1 crime was registered as

Crime No.187/2013 of Mannanchery Police alleging offences

under Section 347. 384, 386, 464, 465, 468, 471 r/w Section

34 of Indian Penal Code against the petitioners.            After

investigation, Annexure II final report was filed which was

taken on file as CC 2000/2013 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha and which is pending before that

court.   It is alleged in the petition that there was some

matrimonial dispute between the first respondent and the

sister of the first petitioner and on account of the same, the

present case has been registered.

Crl.M.C 1556 of 2014
                                 2

      3.    In the meantime, the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of family members

and friends. The first respondent does not want to proceed

with the case any longer. Since some of the offences alleged

are non-compoundable in nature, the same cannot be

compounded before the court below. The petitioners have no

other remedy except to approach this court seeking the

following reliefs:

    "     to quash Annexure II-Final Charge Sheet, and

    further proceedings on the basis of Annexure - II in

    Mannacherry Police Crime No.187/2013 against the

    petitioners before the JFCM(1) Court, Alappuzha as CC

    No.200/2013"

      3.    The first respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

he does not want to proceed with the case and he had filed

Annexure IV affidavit stating all these facts.

      4.    The counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of

the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case.

      5.    The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other cases

Crl.M.C 1556 of 2014
                                 3

between the parties and it is really a family dispute, but opposed

the application.

      6.    It is an admitted fact that, the parties are relatives and

on the basis of a private complaint filed by the first respondent,

which was forwarded to the Police for investigation by the learned

Magistrate under Section 156 (3) of Code of Criminal Procedure,

Annexure 1 crime was registered and after investigation Annexure

II final report was filed and it was taken on file as CC 2000/2013

which is pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Alappuzha.

      7.    The matter has been settled between parties due to the

intervention of mediators and family members. The first respondent

filed Annexure IV affidavit stating that, in view of the settlement

arrived at between the parties due to the intervention of mediators

and family members, he does not want to proceed with the case.

      8.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) it has been held as follows:

  "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be

  summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in

  criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its

  inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

  given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under

  S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

Crl.M.C 1556 of 2014
                                 4

 no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

 the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

 ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any

 Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding

 or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and

 victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

 and circumstances of each case and no category can be

 prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

 Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

 crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

 offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

 quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

 offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not

 private in nature and have serious impact on society.

 Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

 relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention

 of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants

 while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any

 basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such

 offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

 pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

 purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

 commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,   partnership or such

 like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

 relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong

 is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

 resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

 Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

 of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C 1556 of 2014
                                5

 possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

 of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

 prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

 quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

 settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

 the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

 contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

 proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would

 tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

 compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether

 to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

 case is put to end and if the answer to the above question(s)

 is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

 jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      9.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that, it is a family dispute, which

resulted in the registration of crime on the basis of a private

complaint, which was settled due to the intervention of the

mediators and family members and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with case as, chance of conviction is remote and it will

only amount to wastage of Judicial time to proceed with the case, so

this Court feels that it is a fit case to invoke the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the proceedings

to promote the harmony that has been restored in the family. So

the application is allowed and further proceedings in CC 2000/2013

                                6

(Crime No.187/2013 of Mannancherry Police Station ) pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Alappuzha as

against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court immediately.

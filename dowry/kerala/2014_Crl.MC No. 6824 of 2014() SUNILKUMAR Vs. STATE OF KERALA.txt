                    CRL. M.C. No.6824 of 2014
            ...............................................................
            Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                   O R D E R


      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.684/13 of the

Anchalumoodu Police Station, Kollam registered for the

offence punishable under Sections 406, 323 and 498A read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I FIR in Crime No

No.684/13 of the Anchalumoodu Police Station, Kollam and

all further proceedings based on it, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.Nos.6824 of 2014
                               -: 2 :-



more    dowry,      after  misappropriating her   entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The      defacto complainant,  who    is  the     3rd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaint

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.Nos.6824 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed and

Annexure-I      FIR     in Crime     No  No.684/13    of   the

Anchalumoodu Police Station, Kollam and all further

proceedings based on it, are hereby quashed.

            ...............................................................
             Dated this the 27th day of January, 2015

      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.1109/2013 of the

Valapattanam Police Station, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting quashed Annexure I Final

Report and all further proceedings in C.C.1291/2014 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur

in Crime No.1109/2013 of Valapattanam Police Station.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.No.1 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaint against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaint

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.No.1 of 2015
                              -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure I

Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C.1291/2014

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,

Kannur in Crime No.1109/2013 of Valapattanam Police

Station, are hereby quashed.

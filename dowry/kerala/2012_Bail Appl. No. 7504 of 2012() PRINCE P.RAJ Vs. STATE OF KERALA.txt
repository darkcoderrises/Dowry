                          B.A No.7504 of 2012
                 ---------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 12th day of October, 2012

                              O R D E R

      The petitioners are the accused Nos. 2 to 4 in Crime

No.1381/2012 of Adoor Police Station for having committed

offence punishable under Section 498(A) r/w 34 IPC and Section

4 and 5 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

      2.   The marriage between the 1st petitioner and the

defacto complainant was solemnized on 30.5.2009.                     The

allegation against the petitioners is that they are demanded

more dowry and mentally harassed the defacto complainant,

which ultimately lead to filing of the complaint. The petitioners

would say that they are totally innocent and have been falsely

implicated with ulterior motive.

      3.   After having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor, it is felt that it is

just and proper for this Court to exercise its extraordinary

jurisdiction in favour of the petitioners. Accordingly, the petition

is allowed as follows:


          i)    The petitioners shall surrender before the

B.A No.7504 of 2012              : 2:

    Investigating    Officer   on     18.10.2012,   who    after
    interrogation shall produce them before the JFCM
    concerned      and on applications for bail moved by the
    petitioners, the learned Magistrate shall release the
    petitioners on bail on each of them executing a bond for a
    sum of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) with
    two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the
    satisfaction of the said Court.

          ii)    The learned Magistrate shall ensure the
    identity of the sureties and also the veracity of the tax
    receipts before granting bail.

          Iii)   The petitioners shall appear before the
    Investigating Officer concerned for interrogation as and
    when required by him until further orders.

          iv)    The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to
    tamper with the evidence or influence or try to influence
    the witness.

          v)     If any of the condition is violated, the bail
    granted shall stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned,
    on being satisfied of the said fact, may take such
    proceedings as are available to him in law.

                    O.P(Crl) No.3632 Of 2013
                        ----------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of October, 2013.

                          J U D G M E N T


      Judgment dated 23.10.2013 is recalled.

      2.   The O.P(Crl) is filed seeking a direction to the court

below to give a readable copy of the deposition of the witnesses

in C.C.No.977/2008 which is pending before the Judicial first

Class Magistrate Court, Varkala.

      3.   Petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.525/2008 of

Varkala Police Station. The 2nd respondent herein, who is the

wife of the petitioner, filed a complaint against the petitioner

alleging harassment by demanding dowry.             The petitioner

engaged a lawyer, he relinquished his vakalath and a new lawyer

was appointed. The new counsel appeared before the court and

he took copies of the relevant documents including depositions of

all the witnesses. It is submitted that the depositions are not

readable. Hence the counsel requested the court to give readable

copies of the same.

      4.   It is pointed out that the deposition taken down by the

learned Magistrate in C.C.No.977/2008 on the file of the Judicial

                                ::2::

O.P(Crl).No.3632 of 2013


First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala is not readable and hence

the counsel prayed that readable copies of the same may be

provided to the petitioner.

      5.    In Circular No.27/70, D1-25751/70 dated 6.8.1970,

the High Court specified that if the handwriting of any presiding

officer is not easily readable he will arrange for the preparation of

clear legible copies of depositions and statements as soon as

practicable after they are recorded.      The presiding officer will

carefully scrutinise the copies and certify their correctness. But,

although these copies may be referred to, if necessary, certified

copies, must, of course, be prepared only from the original.

      Accordingly, Crl.M.C is disposed of directing court below to

issue readable copies of the depositions of the witnesses in

C.C.No.977/2008 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Varkala on usual terms.


                                               HARUN-UL-RASHID,
                                                       Judge.

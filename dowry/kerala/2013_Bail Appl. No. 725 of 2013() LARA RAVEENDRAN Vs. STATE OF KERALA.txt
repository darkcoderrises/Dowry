                       P. BHAVADASAN, J.
                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                       B.A. No. 725 of 2013
                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
           Dated this the 8th day of February, 2013.

                                  ORDER


          Applicant is the first accused in Crime No.1067 of

2012 of Varkala Police Station, who is alleged to have

committed offences punishable under Sections 498A and

377 I.P.C. Subsequently offence under Section 420 I.P.C.

and Section 66(A) and 66(E) of the Information Technology

Act have also been incorporated.

          2.    The applicant would point out that the

allegations have been made with ulterior motive and

without any basis. It is true that the petitioner had married

the victim, but the allegation of demanding more dowry and

other allegations are unfounded and have been made made

up only for the purpose of implicating him and his parents

in the case.

          3.  Learned Public Prosecutor very vehemently

opposed the petition and pointed out that the offence

B.A.725/2013.                  2

attributed to the petitioner are of grave nature and it may

not be proper for this court to grant anticipatory bail to the

petitioner as it may affect the investigation.

             4. CD was made available for perusal.

             5. The crime was registered about two months

back. On going through the first information statement, it

is difficult to understand how the offences now alleged are

made out.       There seems to be some substance in the

grievance voiced by the petitioner that the allegations are

made only for the purpose of        implicating him and his

parents. A further probe or further analysis of the materials

is not warranted at this point of time. Suffice is to say,

considering the nature of the allegations, it is felt that this

is a fit case where the extraordinary jurisdiction needs to be

exercised in favour of the petitioner.

             Therefore, this application is allowed    on the

following conditions:

      i)      Petitioner shall   surrender   before   the

      Investigating Officer on or before 15.02.2013,

B.A.725/2013.                    3

      who, after interrogation, shall produce him before

      the JFCM court concerned, which court, on

      application for bail being moved by the petitioner,

      shall release him on bail on his executing a bond

      for a sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five

      Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the

      like sum each to the satisfaction of the said court.

      ii)    The learned Magistrate may ensure the

      identity of the sureties and the veracity of the tax

      receipts produced by the sureties for the purpose

      of executing the bond.

      iii)      Petitioner    shall appear   before   the

      Investigating Officer as and when required by him

      and shall report before the Investigating Officer

      on every Wednesday between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.

      till final report is laid.

      iv) Petitioner shall surrender his passport before

      the JFCM court concerned, and if he does not

B.A.725/2013.                   4

      possess a passport, an affidavit to that effect shall

      be filed before the court concerned.

      v) Petitioner shall not leave the State of Kerala

      without    the   permission  of   the    Magistrate

      concerned.

        vi)  Petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to

      tamper with the evidence or influence or try to

      influence the witnesses.

      vii)   If any  of the conditions is violated, bail

      granted to the petitioner shall stand cancelled,

      and the JFCM concerned may take such steps as

      are available to him in law.

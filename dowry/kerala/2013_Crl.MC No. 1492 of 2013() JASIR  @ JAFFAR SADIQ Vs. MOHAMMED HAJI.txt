                  Crl.M.C.No.1492 of 2013
               ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 17th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 8 in C.C.No.1911 of

2012 on the file of the court of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod which is a case instituted upon

the police report in Crime No.234 of 2012 of Kumbala Police

Station for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,

447, 323, 294(b) & 506(i) read with Section 149 of I.P.C. with

a prayer to quash Annexure A1 Final Report and all further

proceedings in C.C.No.1911 of 2012 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of

court.

     2.   The prosecution case is that on 15/04/2012 at 10'o

clock in the night, the petitioners called the de facto

complainant to come outside his house and when he came out,

Crl.M.C.No.1492/2013

                              :-2-:


he was brutally attacked by the petitioners by hitting him with

hand and leg and also abused him with flithy words and

threatened him to kill, thus committed the above offences.

Now the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out

of court with the de facto complainant, who is the first

respondent.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st respondent.      I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who, on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.1492/2013

                              :-3-:


complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure A2 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 447, 323,

294(b) & 506(i) read with Section 149 of I.P.C. which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de

Crl.M.C.No.1492/2013

                                       :-4-:


facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

Crl.M.C.No.1492/2013

                                    :-5-:


         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.No.1492/2013

                             :-6-:


the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A-1 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.1911 of 2012 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod.

                Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013

                         O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is accused in C.C.No.283

of 2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1,

Pathanamthitta, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.38 of 2009 of Aranmula Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 406,

468, 471 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings in C.C.No.283 of 2010 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-1, Pathanamthitta as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that, the

accused was the accountant for the de facto complainant/the

second respondent herein when he was the candidate for

Legislative  Assembly    election  in   Thiruvalla assembly

constituency and during the election, the cheque leaves were

entrusted with the accused for meeting the expenses for the

campaign. According to the prosecution the accused had

Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013           2

forged the signature of the de facto complainant/the second

respondent in the cheque in the account maintained in South

Indian Bank, Kozhencherry Branch and when presented for

encashment the de facto complainant had given stop memo.

On coming to know the fact that it is not the signature of the

de facto complainant, he filed a complaint alleging the offences

punishable under Sections 406, 468, 471 of IPC and now, the

case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

               3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent.           I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

               4.       The learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that during the pendency of the above case,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

               5. The learned counsel for the second respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013             3

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against him.

               6.       I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

               7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 406,

468, 471 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013                 4

me that the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioner accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them.                     In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-




                        "57. The position that emerges from the
              above discussion can be summarised thus: the
              power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
              proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
              inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
              from the power given to a criminal court for
              compounding the offences under S.320 of the
              Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
              no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
              in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
              power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
              to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
              In what cases power to quash the criminal
              proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
              exercised where the offender and victim have
              settled their dispute would depend on the facts
              and circumstances of each case and no category
              can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

               ".........   But  the   criminal  cases   having
               overwhelmingly     and    pre-dominatingly  civil
               flavour stand on different footing for the
               purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
               arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,

Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013                5

               civil, partnership or such like transactions or
               the offences arising out of matrimony relating
               to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
               wrong is basically private or personal in nature
               and the parties have resolved their entire
               dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
               may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
               because of the compromise between the
               offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
               is remote and bleak and continuation of
               criminal case would put accused to great
               oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
               would be caused to him by not quashing the
               criminal case despite       full and complete
               settlement     and   compromise       with    the
               victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances              involved   in   the     present      case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

Crl.M.C.No. 2640 of 2013              6

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.                Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

               In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.283 of 2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Pathanamthitta and all further proceedings

thereto.

              Bail Appl. No. 4517 of 2013
           --------------------------------------------
     Dated this the 26th day of September 2013

                          O R D E R

          Petitioner is the 4th accused, in Crime No.528 of

2013 of the Hosdurg Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC and

Section 15(3) of the Indian Medical Counsel Act.

          2. Case is that the 1st accused who is the

brother of the petitioner married daughter of the defacto

complainant claiming that he has acquired M.D.( in

Medicine). About 300 sovereigns of gold ornaments, an

Endeavor car etc. were given as dowry on the strength of

the said representation made by the 1st accused. It is

alleged that the petitioner who is the sister of the 1st

accused shared the common intention along with the 1st

accused to cheat the defacto complainant and his

daughter. It is further alleged that the ornaments thus

given to the 1st accused was misappropriated among by

the petitioner as well.

          3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submit

that there is no specific allegation against the petitioner

Bail Appl. No. 4517 of 2013   2

in any record. It is submitted that the petitioner got

married even before the marriage of the 1st accused and

is staying with her husband at Kothamangalam.

           4. Learned counsel for the defacto complainant

has submitted that the petitioner was actively with the 1st

accused in making the defacto complainant and his

daughter believe that the 1st accused is an M.D.

           5. Learned Public Prosecutor has submitted

that investigation revealed that 118 gms of gold

ornaments (from out of the gold ornaments the defacto

complainant had allegedly given to her daughter) was

pledged by the petitioner with the Muthoot Fin Corp .

           6. It is seen from the report given by the

investigating officer to the learned Public Prosecutor that

the investigating officer had issued notice to the Muthoot

Fin Corp. to produce the said gold ornaments, they

preferred a writ petition in this Court and this Court

directed the Muthoot Fin Corp. to produce those gold

ornaments before the Court (obviously, the Court which is

trying the offence in the case).

           7. Having heard the learned counsel on both

sides and gone through the report submitted by the

Bail Appl. No. 4517 of 2013    3

investigating officer I am not inclined think that this is a

fit case for granting anticipatory bail. But, I am inclined

to grant some relief to the petitioner.

           Resultantly, this petition is disposed of as

under.

                1. Petitioner is granted three weeks

     time    to   appear    before   the  Jurisdictional

     Magistrate and seek regular bail.

                2. If during the said period of three

     weeks the petitioner is arrested in Crime No.528

     of 2013 of Horsdurg Police Station, she shall be

     released during the said three weeks on

     executing bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees fifteen

     thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum

     each before the arresting officer and subject to

     following conditions.

              (a)   Petitioner shall co-operate with

        the investigation of the case.

              (b) The petitioner shall report to the

        officer    investigating    the   case   for

        interrogation as and when directed and at

        all reasonable times and places.

Bail Appl. No. 4517 of 2013      4

              (c ) It is open to the petitioner to move

       application for bail before the Judicial

       Magistrate with a copy of the application

       given to the Assistant Public Prosecutor at

       least two working days before filing the

       application.

              (d) If custodial interrogation of the

       petitioner is required, it is open to the

       investigating officer to move application

       before the learned Judicial Magistrate at

       the relevant time.

              (e) The application(s) if any preferred

       as    above      shall  be   disposed    of  the

       Jurisdictional Magistrate as expeditiously

       as possible.

                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013.


                         O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.3 and 5 in

C.C.No.1716/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Vatakara, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.729/2009 of Vatakara Police Station]

for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,

341, 323, 324 r/w 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure I FIR and all further proceedings in the above

calendar case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2. The allegation in the above case is that on

4.10.2009 at 20.30 hours, at Thodannur, all the accused, in

prosecution of their common object, after forming into an

unlawful assembly, committed rioting armed with deadly

Crl.M.C.No.3913 of 2013
                             2

weapons, wrongfully restrained CW1, and A1 beat up him

with iron rod. When CW2 attempted to resist the attack of

the accused, A2 to A5 beat up Cws.1 and 2 with their

hands. Both Cws.1 and 2 sustained hurt. Hence all the

accused committed offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 r/w 149 of I.P.C. Now, the

case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of

court with the de facto complainant and consequently,

though the trial in C.C.No.154/2010 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Vatakara, was proceeded against

A1 to A4, all the witnesses turned hostile including DW1,

who launched Ext.P1 FIS and PW2-the injured and other

occurrence witnesses also turned hostile, as evident by

Annexure II judgment.      It is the further case of the

petitioners that the matter is settled with the 1st

respondent/de facto complainant and he had sworn into

Annexure III affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Crl.M.C.No.3913 of 2013
                                3

Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received     from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

         6.        I  have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.3913 of 2013
                             4

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 143,

147, 148, 341, 323, 324 r/w 149 of I.P.C. which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.

It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.3913 of 2013
                                    5

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly       and   pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

Crl.M.C.No.3913 of 2013
                              6

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I FIR and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in C.C.No.1716/2012 of the Judicial First

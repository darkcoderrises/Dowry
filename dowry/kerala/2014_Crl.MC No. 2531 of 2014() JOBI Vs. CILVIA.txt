                   Crl.M.C.No.2531 of 2014
                ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                               ORDER

     The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.4643 of 2013 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur in

which the first respondent is the defacto complainant. The

offence alleged against the petitioner is punishable under

Section 498-A of IPC which is initiated on the basis of a private

complaint filed by the first respondent before the Magistrate

Court. According to the petitioner, the dispute with the first

respondent has already been settled amicably and they

decided to live separately. They have also filed a petition for

divorce on mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu

Marriage Act before the Family Court, Palakkad, which is still

pending.     The first respondent has also filed Annexure-A2

affidavit stating that the entire dispute with the petitioner has

already been settled and she does not want to prosecute the

criminal case filed against the petitioner.

      2.   Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the

petitioner, the learned counsel appearing for the first

respondent and also the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3.   In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108], the Apex Court held that criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a

different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising

out of matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family

disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in

nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

these category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise between

the offender and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is

remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

case despite full and complete settlement and compromise

Crl.M.C.No.2531 of 2014
                              3


with the victim. In other words, the High Court may consider

whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice

to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of

criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the

answer to the above question is in affirmative the High Court

shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

proceedings.

      4.   The allegation against the petitioner is regarding the

commission of offence punishable under Section 498-A of IPC.

Now it is submitted by the learned counsel for the first

respondent that the entire dispute with the petitioner/accused

has been settled and the first respondent does not want to

prosecute the complaint filed before the Magistrate Court. In

such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the proceedings

in Annexure-A1 charge can be quashed by invoking the powers

of this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. in the light of the

Crl.M.C.No.2531 of 2014
                              4


principle laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Singh's case

(supra).

      In  the    result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed quashing

Annexure-A1 charge sheet and all further proceedings in

C.C.No.4643 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Alatur.

                            B.A. No.6137 of 2015
                         --------------------------------------
                Dated this the 12th day of October, 2015

                                      ORDER

            Application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2.    Petitioner is the husband of the defacto complainant. He is

involved in offences punishable under Sections 498A, 324 and 323 of the

Indian Penal Code and Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and

Protection of Children) Act, 2000. Adimali Police registered Crime No.900

of 2015 against the petitioner.

      3.    Prosecution case is that the petitioner married the defacto

complainant in 1997. Shortly after the marriage, he started harassing her

demanding more dowry. On 31.5.2015 at about 11.30 hours in the night,

the accused physically assaulted the defacto complainant and their child

and thereby committed the said offences. Petitioner used a sickle to attack

the defacto complainant.

      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

      5.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is

contradiction in the version of the defacto complainant. In the first

BA No.6137/2015                         2

information statement, it is mentioned that a sickle was used and in the

statement given to the Doctor revealed from the wound certificate, it was

shown that a chopper was used.              Fact remains that the defacto

complainant sustained a wound on scalp.

               Considering the nature of allegations, I deem it fit to pass

appropriate directions. Hence the following order:

               Petitioner shall surrender before the investigating officer within

a period of one week and submit himself for interrogation. Thereafter, the

investigating officer shall produce him before the Magistrate having

jurisdiction on the date of surrender itself. In that event, he is free to move

for bail and the learned Magistrate shall consider the application on merits

as expeditiously as possible, if possible on the date of production itself. If

petitioner does not surrender before the investigating officer within the said

time, the investigating officer is free to arrest him, as if no order is passed

in this case.

               Application is disposed of.




                                              A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

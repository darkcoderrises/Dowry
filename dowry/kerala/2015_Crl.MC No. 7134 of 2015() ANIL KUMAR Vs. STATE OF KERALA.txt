                   Crl.M.C.No.7134 of 2015
                ==============================
            Dated this the 9th day of November, 2015

                              ORDER

            Petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.1120

of 2015 of Palode Police Station for offence punishable under

Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    The allegation of the prosecution is that the petitioner

herein had married the second respondent on 08.09.2011 as per

the religious rites and thereafter, living together. A child was

born in the matrimonial relationship. Thereafter, the matrimonial

relationship got strained and there were alleged instances of

physical and mental harassment in connection with demand for

dowry.      A complaint was lodged, whereupon, crime was

registered. Investigation is proceeding.

      3.    Alleging that the complaint is incorrect and that the

continuance of the proceeding would amount to miscarriage of

justice, this Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the FIR in crime No.1120 of

2015 of Palode Police Station. When the matter came up for

admission, Mr.Rajesh Kannan took notice for the second

Crl.M.C.7134/15
                                    2


respondent and has filed the vakkalath.             Learned Assistant

Solicitor General of India took notice on behalf of the third

respondent, Passport Officer.

       4.      It was submitted by the learned counsel for the

petitioner as well as by the second respondent that the parties

have amicably and voluntarily settled all their disputes. They are

living together now. It was further submitted by both the counsel

that all attempts would be taken by both of them to ensure that

the matrimonial relationship is maintained in future.

       5.      Learned   Public   Prosecutor    on   instruction also

submitted that instructions have been received that the husband

and wife are now living together under the same roof. An affidavit

has been filed by the second respondent supporting the claim of

the husband that the matter has been amicably settled and that

they are living together as husband and wife.

       6.      In the light of the above statement, nothing further

survives. In the interest of maintaining the matrimonial

relationship, it is essential that continuance of the further

proceedings in Crime No.1120 of 2015 is quashed.             No public

interest is involved since it is essentially a private dispute.

                                  3


               In the result, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further

proceedings pursuant to crime No.1120 of 2015 of Palode Police

Station stands quashed.

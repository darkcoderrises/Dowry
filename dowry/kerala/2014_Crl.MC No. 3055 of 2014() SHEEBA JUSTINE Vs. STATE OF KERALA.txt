                   =================
                  CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014
               =====================
               Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER

                              --------

      This is an application filed by the second accused in

CC.No.428      of 2014 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pala to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner has

been    arrayed as second accused       in CC.No.428 of 2014 of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala which was originated

on the basis of Crime No.57 of 2013 of Pala police station, was

registered on the basis of complaint given by the second

respondent as the defacto complainant against the petitioner

and her husband alleging offences under sections 406, 420,

417, 468, 471 and 120B of Indian Penal Code.                After

investigation, Annexure-3 final report was filed and it was taken

on file as CC.No.428 of 2014 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Pala.      There were civil disputes also

between the parties in respect of the same property and due to

the intervention of     mediators and well wishers, the entire

disputes between the parties have been settled. The crime itself

was registered on account of the property disputes raised by

the both the parties. In view of the settlement, no purpose will

CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014               2

be served by proceeding with the case. Since some of the offences

are non compoundable in nature, they could not file the application

before the concerned Court            for record compounding. So the

petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this Court

seeking the following reliefs:-

      to call for the records in CC.No.428 of 2014 in the file of the

      Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala and to quash Annexure

      A3-Charge in so far as it is against the petitioner/2nd accused,

      by allowing the defacto complainant and the petitioner to

      compound the offence alleged against the petitioner and allow

      the above Criminal Miscellaneous Case.

      2.     The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

in the civil appeal RFA.No.504 of 2011 pending before this Court,

the petitioner had executed documents transferring the title of the

properties in his name and he had withdrawn the civil appeal on the

basis of that settlement. Further the petitioner is the sister-in-law of

the second respondent and in view of the settlement, he does not

want to prosecute the petitioner any longer. Further according to

the second respondent the first accused is absconding and his

whereabouts are not known and so they could not implead him in

this petition as well. He had filed Annexure-2 affidavit stating these

facts.

CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014           3

      3.    Counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of the

settlement no purpose will be served in proceedings with the case

and the first accused is none other than the husband of the

petitioner and he is now living with some other lady and his

whereabouts are not known. So he prayed for allowing the

application.

      4.    The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case against

the petitioner and the matter is between relatives and the first

accused is now not available in station and his whereabouts are not

known as well but opposed the application.

      5.    It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was arrayed as

second accused in Crime No.57 of 2013 of Pala police station which

was registered on the basis of Ext.P1 written complaint given by

the defacto complainant to the Station House Officer against the

present petitioner and her husband and after investigation,

Annexure-3 final report was filed which was taken on file as

CC.No.428 of 2014 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Pala and it is pending before that Court now. It is also an

admitted fact that there were some civil disputes pending before the

Civil Court which reached this Court as RFA.No.504 of 2011 which

was filed by the defacto complainant against the decree and

judgment passed by the Court below and since the matter has been

CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014              4

settled between the parties and the petitioner had executed

documents in respect of the disputed property in favour of the

second respondent, they have decided to withdraw all the litigations

including the prosecution against the petitioner and her husband

and RFA No.504 of 2011 was with drawn which is evident from

Annexure-2 affidavit filed by the second respondent. It is also seen

from the affidavit that the petitioner is none other than the sister-

in-law of the second respondent and the entire disputes arose due

to some property dispute and that was settled due to the

intervention of the mediators and well wishers and their relationship

has been restored now.

      6. Further, in view of the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties, no purpose will be served by proceeding the

case against the petitioner as they will not support the case of the

prosecution and conviction    in     such    cases     will   be     remote.

Considering the fact that the first accused is not available to join the

petition as his whereabouts are not known, taking this an

exceptional circumstance, this Court feels that the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to

entertain the application as against the present petitioner alone.

      7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:-

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be

      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in criminal

CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014                   5

      proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent

      jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal

      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

      has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

      the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the

      offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the

      facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be

      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court

      must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.

      Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like

      murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though

      the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have serious

      impact on society.      Similarly, any compromise between the victim

      and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like

      Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any

      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But

      the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

      flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing,

      particularly   the   offences    arising  from   commercial,   financial,

      mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences

      arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

      disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of

      case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

      because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

      and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

      criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise

      with the victim.      In other words, the High Court must consider

      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

CRL.M.C.NO.3055 OF 2014                 6

       proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

       settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and

       whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

       case is put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

       affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

       quash the criminal proceeding."

       8.    In view of the dictum laid on in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the parties are relatives and due to

some property disputes crimes as well as civil litigations have been

initiated and all these litigations were settled due to the intervention

of the mediators and no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case and conviction in such cases will be remote, this Court

feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of

Criminal Procedure Code can be invoked to quash the proceedings

as against the petitioner in order to promote settlement and

harmony in the family.

       So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.428 of 2014 now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pala as against the petitioner is quashed.

       Office is directed to communicate this order to the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Pala immediately.

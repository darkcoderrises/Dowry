                    Bail Application No.5226 of 2010
             .....................................................
                           Dated: 13.09.2010

                                   ORDER

      Petitioner who is the accused in Crime No.459/2010 of Kumbla

Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 498 A and 304B

seeks his enlargement on bail.           The occurrence took place on

08.08.2010. The petitioner was arrested on 17.8.2010.

      2.    The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application

contending, inter alia, that the marriage was on 21.01.2010 and the

dead body of the petitioner's wife Geetha was found on 08.08.2010 in

a well near her home, that she was hospitalised for dehydration due to

denial of food from the matrimonial home where she was locked up

in a room pursuant to the demand for dowry.

      3.    Having regard to the nature of the allegations levelled

against the petitioner, the relative conduct of the parties, the nature

of the injury sustained, the sentiments of the near relatives of the

victim  and the other facts and circumstances of the case, if the

petitioner is released on bail, he will definitely influence and

intimidate the prosecution witnesses. There is also the likelihood of

the petitioner making himself scarce and fleeing from justice. I am,

therefore, not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage.

      This petition is accordingly dismissed.



                                             V. RAMKUMAR, (JUDGE)

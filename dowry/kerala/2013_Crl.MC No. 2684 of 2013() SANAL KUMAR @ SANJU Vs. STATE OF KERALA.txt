                   Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 2nd day of July, 2013.


                             O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 3 in

C.C.No.48/09 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Thiruvananthapuram, which is a case instituted upon

the    police     report      [in    Crime       No.    473/08 of

Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 341, 323, 324,

506(ii), 34 of I.P.C. r/w section 27 of Arms Act, with a prayer

to quash all further proceedings as against the petitioners in

Annexure A final report, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that the

accused persons due to enemity that the motor bike driven

by the de facto complainant hit him at his chest and

Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                              :-2-:

abdomen and other other accused criminally intimidated the

de facto complainant with a sword and thereby committed

the offences. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court, as evident from Annexure B

affidavit signed by the 2nd respondent/de facto complainant.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.         Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                              :-3-:

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against

them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 294(b),

341, 323, 324, 506(ii), 34 of I.P.C. r/w section 27 of Arms

Act, which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                                  :-4-:

2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant         has   no  further      grievance     against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding     or complaint    or  F.I.R.  may    be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                                 :-5-:

         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,      financial,   mercandile,    civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused
         to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

Crl.M.C.No.2684 of 2013
                              :-6-:

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.        Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A final report and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No. 48 of 2009 of the

Additional          Chief   Judicial   Magistrate    Court,

Thiruvananthapuram.

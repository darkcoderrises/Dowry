                    ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 5th day of November 2008

                               O R D E R

     The petitioner faces indictment in two prosecutions one

under Sections 498A & 494 I.P.C and the other under the

provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act.                     In both cases,

cognizance have already been taken. In the prosecution under

Section 498A I.P.C, the petitioner had entered appearance and

was enlarged on bail.         In the other, the petitioner has not

appeared so far. Coercive processes have been issued by the

learned Magistrate against the petitioner in both cases. The

former case - the one under Section 498A I.P.C has now been

transferred to the list of long pending cases. Coercive processes

issued by the learned Magistrate are chasing the petitioner now.

The petitioner apprehends imminent arrest. He has now come to

this court with the prayer that directions under Section 482

Cr.P.C may be issued to the learned Magistrate to comply with

the directions in Alice George vs.Deputy Superintendent of

Police [2003(1)KLT 339] and to consider his application for

bail to be filed by him when he surrenders before the learned

Crl.M.C.Nos.4192 & 4202 of 2008   2




Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously -

on the date of surrender itself.

      2.      Sufficient general directions have already been

issued in Alice George (Supra). It is not necessary for this

court in every subsequent case to issue directions to the

Magistracy to follow the dictum in Alice George (Supra). Every

court is bound to do the same. I have no reason to assume that

the same shall not be done. If the directions are not complied

with the avenues of challenge/complaint are available for the

petitioner.

      3.    In the result, this petition is dismissed subject to the

above specific observations.

      4.    Hand over copy of this order to the learned counsel

for the petitioner for production before the learned Magistrate.



                                              (R.BASANT, JUDGE)

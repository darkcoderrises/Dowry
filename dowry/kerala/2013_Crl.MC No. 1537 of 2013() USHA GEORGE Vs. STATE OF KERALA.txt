                       Crl.M.C.No. 1537 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 4th day of July, 2013

                                O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the de facto complainant in C.C.No.885 of 2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Cass Magistrate Court-I, Vaikom for the

offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash all proceedings in C.C.No.885 of 2011 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Vaikom as the

matter is settled out of court.

         2.   According to the petitioner/the de facto complainant, she

was married by the second respondent on 15.5.2008 at St.Sebastian

Church, Santhipuram as per the rites and customs prevailing in the

Christian community and a child was born in the wedlock and during

the stay along with the accused, they have harassed the petitioner

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

mentally and physically. Now, the case of the de facto complainant as

well as the accused is that the matter is settled out of court. Therefore,

the de facto complainant came forwarded by filing the above Crl.M.C.

with a prayer to quash all proceedings in C.C.No.885/2011 on the file

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Vaikom.

         3.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the   respondents 2 to 4.      I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioner/de facto

complainant submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of

the proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent/accused,

who on the basis of specific instruction received               from the

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

respondents, submitted that the matter is settled out of court and

pleaded for dropping the proceedings pending against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     Annexure A2 is the photostat copy of the

agreement arrived into between the parties to the dispute and

Annexure A3 is the affidavit of the de facto complainant.         I have

verified the documents and materials produced along with the above

petition.    In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Section 498A read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.         It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                            :-4-:

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

petitioner/de facto complainant, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the second respondent/

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture,

it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision

reported     in    Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as

follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

          considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

          also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

          matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

          home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

          the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

          the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

          Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                             :-5-:

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                            :-6-:

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in

         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort

         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their

         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice

         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power

         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A

of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated

Crl.M.C.No.1537 of 2013

                                 :-7-:

from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the

parties want a quietus to the criminal case as well.

         8.     According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision will be squarely applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of the trial proceeded,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

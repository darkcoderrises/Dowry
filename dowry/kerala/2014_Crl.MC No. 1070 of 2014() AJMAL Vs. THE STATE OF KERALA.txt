                          Crl.M.C. No.1070 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 7th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R



           This criminal miscellaneous case is field by

accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.38/2014 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam, to quash further

proceedings in the above crime, recording the composition

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called the `Code').

           2.     It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 3 in the above

crime. The crime was registered on the basis of a statement

given by the 2nd respondent against the petitioners, alleging

offences under Section 452, 294(b), 506(i) and 427 read

with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The matter has been

settled between the parties now. The 2nd respondent does

not want to proceed with the prosecution of the case. Since

it is in the crime stage and some of the offences are non-

compoundable          in      nature,          police         cannot           close the

Crl.M.C. No.1070 of 2014
                               2

investigation without the intervention of this court, so the

above petition has been filed by the petitioner, seeking the

above relief.

            3.    The   2nd respondent   appeared     through

counsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled

between the parties and there is no necessity to proceed

with the investigation of the case, as he has no grievance

against the petitioners. I have called for the report from the

learned public prosecutor, as to whether the petitioners

have any previous criminal background or any criminal

cases have been pending against them of this nature. The

learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, this is the only

crime registered against the petitioners and there is no

other criminal cases registered against the petitioners and

they have no criminal background. But the learned Public

Prosecutor opposed the application on the ground that, the

quashing of the first information report cannot be

entertained at the initial stage.

Crl.M.C. No.1070 of 2014
                                 3

            4.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, a case was

registered as crime No.38/2014 of Kayamkulam, Police

Station, alleging offences under Section 448, 294(b), 323,

506(1), and 427 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

Later they filed a report to delete the section 448 of the

Indian penal code and add to Section 452 of the Indian

Penal Code. The matter has been now settled between the

parties. The defacto-complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has field Annexure-2 affidavit stating that the matter

has been settled due to the intervention of mediators and he

has no grievance against the present petitioners now and he

does not want to prosecute them.

            5.    The counsel for the 2nd respondent also

submitted that, he had no objection in allowing the

application. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

observed as follows:

Crl.M.C. No.1070 of 2014
                                    4

            "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
      for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
      arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences
      arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
      family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
      quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
      compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation    of  the    criminal    proceedings   would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
      that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."



Considering the fact that, the matter has been amicably

settled between the parties, due to the intervention of

mediators and the petitioners have no criminal background

and they have realised their mistakes and settled their

claims with the defacto-complainant, I feel that it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of the 'Code' has

Crl.M.C. No.1070 of 2014
                                   5

to be invoked to quash Annexure-A1 first information report

and further proceedings thereon as no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case, since the defacto-

complainant is not likely to support the prosecution and co-

operate with the investigation. So the application is allowed

and    Annexure-A1      first   information    report   in    Crime

No.38/2014 of Kayamkulam Police Station and further

proceedings on the same are quashed. Office is directed to

communicate this order to the concerned court to be

informed to the concerned police station for necessary

further action in this regard.

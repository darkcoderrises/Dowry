    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 12th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the accused persons in

Crime No.1889/13 of Pathanamthitta Police Station to quash

the proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at

between the de facto complainant and themselves under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

the accused in Crime No.1889/13 of Pathanamthitta Police

Station, alleging offences under Sections.419, 420, 465, 468,

471 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The allegation

was that, accused Nos.1 and 2 in furtherance of common

intention had managed to forge a Power of Attorney in the year

2004 as document No.266/04, dated 22.12.2004 of Sub

Registrar Office, Pathanamthitta of the de facto complainant

and using that power of attorney, transferred the properties

belonging to the de facto complainant to accused Nos.3 and 4

as sale deed No.105/05 of Perunad Sub Registrar Office and

thereby they have committed the aforesaid offences. The

matter has been settled between the parties due to the

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014      : 2 :

intervention of family members and well wishers and it was on

the basis of a misconception that the de facto complainant had

filed a complaint.      In view of the settlement, there is no

possibility of any conviction being entered into against the

accused persons. Since it is in the crime stage and some of

the offences are non-compoundable in nature, neither the

police nor the court will not drop the case at this stage. So,

they have no other option, but to approach this seeking the

following relief:

           "To quash the annexure 1 proceedings in Crime

    No.1889/2013 of Pathanamthitta Police Station on the file of the

    C.J.M, Pathanamthitta."

       3.    First   respondent  entered      appearance        through

Counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parties and in fact, it was due to misconception of

first respondent that a case has been registered. Now, he

realized that he executed a power of attorney in favour of

accused Nos. 1 and 2 and it was on that basis, the documents

have been executed and he has no grievance regarding the

same. The civil suit filed in respect of the same issue was also

settled and it was not pressed and he had filed an affidavit to

that effect as well. The Counsel for the petitioners also

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014      : 3 :

submitted in support of their case in the petition.

       4.    The    learned  Public Prosecutor   submitted the

statement of the investigating officer stating that crime has

been registered in respect of the incident on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant and though

notice has been issued to the de facto complainant and the

accused persons under Section 41A of Code of Criminal

Procedure, they have not produced the documents. So, they

could not proceed with the investigation in the matter and

they requires six months time for completing the investigation

in filing the final report. The learned Public Prosecutor under

the circumstances, opposed the application.

       5.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

complaint filed by the de facto complainant before the Director

General of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, which was forwarded

to the Station House Officer, Pathanamthitta, through proper

channel, the above crime was registered as crime No.1889/13

of    Pathanamthitta     Police Station  against   the  present

petitioners alleging offences under Sections.419, 420, 465,

468, 471 and Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.              The

investigation is being conducted by the investigating officer in

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014     :  4 :

this regard. In the meantime, it appears that the matter has

been settled between the parities. It is also seen from the

affidavit field by the first respondent that he had filed a suit

O.S.No.131/13 before the Munsiff Court, Pathanamthitta, to

set aside the documents executed by petitioners 1 and 2 on

the basis of the power of attorney and for recovery of

possession etc., and when he came to understand that he had

really executed a power of attorney in favour of them, it was

on that basis the sale deeds were executed and it was

convinced to him at the mediation held at the instance of the

family members and well wishers and on that basis, he had

decided to withdraw the suit filed by him and also the

complaint filed against the petitioners and on that basis the

suit field by him was dismissed as not pressed. So, it is clear

from the averments in the affidavit that, though he availed the

civil remedy of setting aside documents alleged to have been

executed based on an alleged forged power of attorney, he

had later not pressed that suit. Further, it is also seen from

the affidavit filed that he had given the complaint under the

misconception that he had not executed any no power of

attorney. But, later, he realized that the power of attorney

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014        :   5 :

was executed by him and he had now ratified the acts done on

the basis of the power of attorney.                 So, considering the

circumstances that a pure civil dispute has been converted in

to a criminal offence on the basis of misconception on the part

of the de facto complainant which has now been settled due to

the intervention of mediators, no purpose will be served by

allowing the prosecution to investigation to continue as neither

the de facto complainant nor any of the witnesses cited by him

are going to support the investigating agency to file a final

report     implicating   the    petitioners      as    accused     alleging

commission of those offences.

      6.     Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
      the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
      wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard
      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014           :  6 :

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society.         Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or
      the offences committed by public servants while working in
      that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the
      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,       partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is
      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal   proceeding    or    continuation  of  the  criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law
      despite settlement and compromise between the victim and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer
      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."



      7.      So, considering the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and the de facto complainant had

now ratified the acts of the accused persons and withdrawn the

civil suit filed by him due to the settlement arrived at between

Crl.M.C.No.1350 of 2014     :  7 :

them on account of the intervention of family members and

others and no purpose will be served in allowing the

investigation to continue in this regard, this court feels that it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

to save the judicial time in such matters.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.1889/13 of Pathanamthitta Police Station as against

the petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate

this order to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta, to

inform the same to the concerned police station for taking

further necessary action in this regard.

                      K.RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                      -----------------------
                      Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                      --------------------------
             Dated this the 11th day of March, 2014

                            O R D E R

     This is an application filed by the petitioner, who is the

sole accused in Crime No.610/2012 of Peringome Police Station

of Kannur District to quash the proceedings under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner has

purchased an extent of 15 cents of land as per Annexure A6

sale deed in the year 2009. The property was an excess land

taken over by the Government and as per Annexure 2, it was

assigned to one Kuzhithatta Krishnan. The said Krishnan had

transfered the property to one Gangadharan as per A4 sale

deed and as per Annexure A5 sale deed the Sri.Gangadharan

transfered the property to Sri.P.V.Saji and from the said Saji

the petitioner purchased the same as per Ext.A6 sale deed. He

has sold the property as per Annexure A7 in the year 2011.

Mutation has been effected in the name of the second

respondent and basic tax was also paid by the second

respondent. Later when the second respondent applied for site

plan, the Village Officer declined to issue the same stating that

the proceedings under Section 85(8) of Kerala Land Reforms

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                           2

Act is pending regarding this property and so site plan cannot

be granted. On enquiry, the petitioner came to understand

that, some persons claiming interest over the total area

extending 201 acres filed applications under Section 85(8) of

Kerala Land Reforms Act after about 20 years and that

application was dismissed by the Taluk Land Board and that

was challenged before this Court and this Court also did not

entertain the same and they moved the Honourable Supreme

Court and that was pending before the Honourable Supreme

Court and this was intimated to the Village Officer and non-

issuance of site plan was on the basis of such intimation

received by the Village Officer.       The Village Officer has

committed illegality by not issuing site plan on flimsy grounds.

The remedy of the the second respondent complainant is to

approach the higher authorities against the illegal act of the

Village Officer, instead, he filed a complaint before the Police

and the Police had registered a crime against the petitioner as

Crime No. 610/2012 alleging offences under Section 406 and

420 of Indian Penal Code. There is no criminal offence made

out and even if the entire allegation are admitted, it is only a

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                            3

civil dispute and no criminal offence is committed.      So the

petitioner has no other options except to approach this court

seeking the following reliefs:

        "To quash the Annexure A1 FIR in Crime No.610 of

  2012 of Peringom Police Station"

      3.   Notice    on   admission     was   issued to  second

respondent. The second respondent appeared through counsel

and now the second respondent has filed an affidavit stating

that the matter has been settled between the parties and he

does not want to proceed with the prosecution and he want to

withdraw the same.

      4.   The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the

investigation is in the primitive stage.

      5.   The counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view

of the settlement arrived at between the defacto complainant

and the petitioner, no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the investigation and the possibility of conviction in this

case even if the final report filed is remote.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, since

the investigation is in the primitive stage cannot be quashed.

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                            4

      7.   It is an admitted fact that Annexure A1 crime was

registered on the basis of the compliant filed by the second

respondent before the Circle Inspector of Police Payyannur,

which was forwarded to the Peringom Police Station within

whose jurisdiction, the offence was alleged to have been

committed and on that basis, the present crime was

registered. The documents produced by the petitioner show

that he has obtained the property from a person in whose

favour the excess land taken over by the Government under

the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act was assigned as

per Annexure A2 document by the change of hands, and he

sold this property to the second respondent. When the second

respondent applied for site plan of the property in view of the

pendency of the proceedings under Section 85(8) of the Kerala

Land Reforms Act before the Honourable Supreme Court, the

Village Officer did not issue the site plan, which prompted the

second respondent to file the complaint, which resulted in

registration of crime.

      8.   Now the matter has been settled between the

parties and the second respondent had filed Annexure A10

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                              5

affidavit, wherein he had categorically stated that the matter

has been settled between the petitioner and himself and he

has no grievance against the petitioner and he does not want

to proceed with the prosecution and he has no objection in

quashing further proceedings in the above matter.

           9.     In the decision reported Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) it has been held as

follows:

 "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
 summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
 criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
 inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
 given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
 S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
 statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
 guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
 justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
 what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
 complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and
 victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and
 circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
 However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
 have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
 Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
 like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
 even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
 settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
 have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
 between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
 under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
 offences committed by public servants while working in that
 capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
 proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
 having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                               6

  on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
  the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
  civil,  partnership or such like transactions or the offences
  arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
  disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
  nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
  this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
  proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between
  the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
  and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused
  to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
  be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
  and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
  other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be
  unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
  criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
  would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
  and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
  whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
  criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
  question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
  its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

       10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, it is a matter of

civil nature, the parties have come to a settlement in respect

of their civil dispute and the defacto complainant does not

want to further proceed with the prosecution matter, there will

not be any possibility of any conviction being entered into

against the petitioner even if ultimately, the final report is filed

and the case was allowed to proceed with trial by the trial

court and it will only amount to wastage of judicial time, this

Crl.M.C 2752 of 2012
                              7

court feels that it is a fit case where, the power under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash

further proceedings. So the application is allowed and further

proceedings in Crime No.610/2012 of Peringom Police Station

against the petitioner is quashed.         Office is directed to

communicate this order to the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court Payyannur to inform the Police Station for further

necessary action in this regard.

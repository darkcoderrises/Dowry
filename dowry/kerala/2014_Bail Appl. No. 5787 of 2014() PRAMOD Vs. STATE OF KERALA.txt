                          O R D E R

        The petitioners are accused in Crime No.354/14 of

Rajakkadu Police Station and apprehending arrest in the

above crime, they preferred the present application under

section 438 of Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail.

     2. The prosecution allegation against the petitioners

is that the 1st petitioner married the de facto complainant

on 2.7.2006 and thereafter they were living as husband and

wife. Two children were born in their relationship. At the

time of marriage, the de facto complainant was given 30

sovereigns of gold and Rs.1.25 lakhs as dowry. The further

allegation is that the petitioners demanded more dowry

and 1st petitioner assaulted the de facto complainant on

13.1.2014 by slapping on her cheeks and kicking on her

abdomen, which was done on the basis of the instigation of

the petitioner nos.2 and 3, who are the parents of the 1st

                              2

petitioner, and forced the de facto complainant and

children to leave the matrimonial house and thereby the

accused      have committed    offences  punishable   under

sections 498A, 323, 324 r/w 34 of IPC.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently

submitted that the above criminal case was registered as

part of the matrimonial dispute and the present crime was

registered on the basis of the private complaint made by

the de facto complainant. It is also the submission of the

learned counsel that petitioner nos.2 and 3 who are aged

persons are the parents of the 1st petitioner, who is the

husband of the de facto complainant. The learned Public

Prosecutor also submitted that no specific overtact is

alleged against the petitioners except a general allegation.

      5.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, especially when the de facto

complainant did not approach the Police directly on any

occasion prior to the filing of the complaint in the court of

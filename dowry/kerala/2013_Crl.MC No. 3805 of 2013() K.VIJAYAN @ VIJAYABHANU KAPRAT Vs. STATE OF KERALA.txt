                Crl.M.C.No.3805 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 9th day of September, 2013

                           ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in Crime No.468/2010 of

Tirurangadi Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 447, 341, 323, and 324 IPC and Section 3(1)(X) of

Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)

Act, 1980 with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR and Charge

in CrimeNo.468/2010 of Tirurangadi Police Station and

S.C.No.384/2011 pending before SC/ST Court Manjeri as the

matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above crime is that the

petitioner after committing criminal trespass into the property

of the defacto complainant, stopped the defacto complainant

and caused simple hurt and insulted him with an intention to

humiliate the defacto complainant. Thus, according to the

prosecution the petitioner accused has committed the offences

punishable under Sections 447, 341, 323, and 324 IPC and

Section 3(1)(X) of Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1980, Now, the case of the

Crl.M.C.No.3805 of 2013
                               2

petitioner is that during the pendency of the above case the

entire dispute is settled with the defacto complainant, the

second respondent herein, who sworn into Annexure A2

affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

Crl.M.C.No.3805 of 2013
                                 3

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 447, 341, 323, and 324

IPC and Section 3(1)(X) of Schedule Castes and Schedule

Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1980, which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:     the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

Crl.M.C.No.3805 of 2013
                                      4

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But     the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

Crl.M.C.No.3805 of 2013
                                5

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No.468/2010 of Tirurangadi Police Station

and all further proceedings thereto.

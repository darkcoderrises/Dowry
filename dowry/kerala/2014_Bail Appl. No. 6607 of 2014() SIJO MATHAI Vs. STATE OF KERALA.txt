     This is an application filed by the petitioners, who are accused in

Crime No.224/2014 of Kanjikuzhy Police Station, for anticipatory bail

     2. The Prosecution allegation is that the marriage between the first

accused, who is the first petitioner herein and the de facto complainant

was solemnized on 02.07.2013 and thereafter while the de facto

complainant was residing in her matrimonial home, she was subjected to

harassment demanding more dowry and thus, according to the

prosecution, the accused, four in numbers, have committed the offence

punishable under Section 498(A) r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor.

allegation against the petitioners are false and the petitioners are

implicated in the above crime connected with some matrimonial disputes.

there is no specific allegation against the petitioners and the allegations

are general in nature.

       6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, I am of the view that this petition can be allowed however, subject to

stringent conditions.

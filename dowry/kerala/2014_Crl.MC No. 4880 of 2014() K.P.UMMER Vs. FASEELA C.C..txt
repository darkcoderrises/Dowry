                ===========================
                      Crl.M.C No.4880 of 2014
               ============================
               Dated this the 26th day of August, 2014

                                ORDER


     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners,

who are accused Nos.1 to 5 respectively in C.C.No.3255/2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Mattannur for the offences

punishable under Section 498A r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure A1 and all further proceedings thereon in C.C

No.3255/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

mattannur as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.    The allegation in the above case is that the 2nd petitioner

married the de facto complainant on 20.02.2011 and thereafter lived

together as husband and wife at the matrimonial home. While so, the

accused persons started to harass the de facto complainant both

                                       2



mentally and physically for more dowry and now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

          6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties

Crl.M.C No.4880 of 2014
                                              3



to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case are under

Section 498A r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, which is more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offence is involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the

decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been
          on considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of
          complaints under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against
          the husband but also against the relatives of the husband.      The
          question is when such matters are resolved either by the wife
          agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of
          other pending disputes for which both the sides approached the High
          Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal proceedings or

Crl.M.C No.4880 of 2014
                                                4



          the FIR or complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406 of
          I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the sole ground that
          since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the
          Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash the criminal
          proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                   8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to
          the filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of
          IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with
          the help and intervention of family members, friends and well-
          wishers, the parties concerned have amicably settled their
          differences and executed a compromise/settlement.             Pursuant
          thereto, the appellants filed the said compromise before the Trial
          Court with a request to place the same on record and to drop the
          criminal proceedings against the appellants herein. It is also not in
          dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the
          parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she
          did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against the
          appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It
          is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court
          rejected such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe
          exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the
          ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the offences
          punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
          compoundable in nature."
                   "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage
          genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the
          same are on considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
          compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court
          is satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and
          without any pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends
          of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise
          of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal
          proceedings.
                       13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes
          in recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important
          place and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore,
          every effort should be made in the interest of the individuals in order
          to enable them to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the
          parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes
          amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of
          law, in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial matters, the
          Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary
          jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power under Section 482
          should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when

Crl.M.C No.4880 of 2014
                                            5



           the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that
           allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the
           process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that the
           proceedings ought to be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A of

I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated from the

matrimonial issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a

quietus to the criminal case as well.

          According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement

arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be

squarely applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties to

the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.

It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the

event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer wastage of judicial time and abuse of process of the court

and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure - A1

and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.

                  B.A. No.6313 of 2014
           --------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 11th day of August 2015

                          O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

          2. Petitioner is accused in Crime No.1009 of

2014 of Guruvayoor Police station registered for the

offences under Secs.306 and 498A of the Indian Penal

Code. The prosecution case is that he subjected his wife

to cruelty demanding more dowry, as a result of which,

she committed suicide.

          3. Heard both sides.

          4. It is doubtful whether Sec.306 IPC will be

attracted. The petitioner and the victim had been married

for 20 years. The incident happened in June 2014. The

victim did not leave behind any suicide note. It appears

that detention of the petitioner is not necessary for

effective investigation. So I am inclined to grant the

prayer of the petitioner.

          In the result, the bail application is allowed.

          1) The petitioner shall be released on bail

B.A. No.6313 of 2014       2

     after interrogation on his executing a bond for

     Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees one lakh only) with two

     solvent sureties each for the like sum if he is

     arrested by the Police in connection with this

     case.

          2) The petitioner shall appear before the

     Investigating Officer between 10.00 a.m. and

     11.00 a.m. every alternate Wednesdays for

     two months or till the final report is filed,

     whichever is earlier.

          3) He shall surrender his passport before

     the lower court concerned or if he does not

     have the one, file an affidavit to that effect.

          4) He shall not leave India without the

     previous permission of the court of enquiry or

     the trial court concerned as the case may be.

          5) He shall not destroy or tamper with

     evidence nor shall he get himself involved in

     any other criminal case.

          6) He shall not intimidate or attempt to

B.A. No.6313 of 2014       3

     influence the witnesses.

           7) He shall co-operate with investigation

     of the case.

            In case of violation of any of the above

conditions, the learned Magistrate is empowered to

cancel the bail in accordance with the law.

          If   the  petitioner  surrenders     before  the

Magistrate, this order is not applicable and the learned

Magistrate may pass appropriate orders.

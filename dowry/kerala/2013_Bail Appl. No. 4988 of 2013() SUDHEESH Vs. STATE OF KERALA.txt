                   -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 17th day of July, 2013

                              ORDER

      Petitioner is the sole accused in crime No.1004/2013 of

Ottappalam Police Station, registered for offences punishable

under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code. He has filed

the above application seeking pre-arrest bail under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for short "the Code".

      2.    The above crime was registered on a complaint

filed by wife of petitioner before the magistrate and that being

forwarded to police for investigation and report under Section

156(3) of the Code. The wife, defacto complainant, is living

separately from him with a child, born out of the wedlock of

spouses, for the last more than 1 = years and the crime has

been registered imputing harassment and ill-treatment against

her, demanding dowry on false allegations, is the submission

of counsel. Petitioner is prepared to abide by any condition

and also willing to co-operate with the investigation of crime

is the further submission of counsel to urge for granting him

anticipatory bail.

      3.    After hearing learned Public Prosecutor also and

perusing the Case Diary produced and taking note that the

crime has arisen out of matrimonial disputes of spouses, I find,

B.A.No.4988 of 2013                   2




arrest and custodial interrogation of petitioner as such may

not be essential for a fair investigation of the crime. Petitioner

in the given facts of the case can be extended pre-arrest bail.

        1.    In the event of arrest of petitioner in

              connection with the above crime he is

              directed to be released on bail on his

              execution of a bond for Rs.10,000/- with one

              solvent surety for the like sum.

        2.    He shall report before the investigating

              officer at 10:00 a.m on 22.07.2013 for his

              interrogation      and    also    to facilitate

              investigation of crime.

        3.    He shall report before the investigating

              officer later also, if so demanded for smooth

              completion of investigation of crime.

       In default of petitioner to appear on 22.07.2013 at the

time fixed, this order shall cease to have any effect.

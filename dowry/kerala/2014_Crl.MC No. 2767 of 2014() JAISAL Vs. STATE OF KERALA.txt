               ---------------------------
              Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014
             -------------------------------
       Dated this the 4th day of June, 2014

                        ORDER


     This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1

to 3 in C.C.No.578/2013 pending before the Judicial

First class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement

under Section 482 of the code o Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called as the 'Code')

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners

were arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime

No.254/2013 of Thamarassery Police station which

was registered on the basis of the statement given by

the second respondent as de facto complainant

alleging commission of offence under Sections 341,

323, 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3. It was a clash between the sympathizers of

S.S.F.party and Indian Union Muslim League. Both

belong to same community. After investigation final

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014             2

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C. No.

578/2013 and it is now pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery.             Between the

same faction, some other incidents also happened and

C.C.No.402/2013 and 403/2013 were also pending before

the same court in respect of those incidents happened

between the same two groups. Since it happened

between the two factions of the same community on

account of their political ideology, due to the intervention

of well wishers and community leaders, the matter has

been settled between the parties and they have decided

to withdraw all the criminal cases in connection with this

factional difference. Since some of the offences are non

compoundable in nature, they could not file an application

before the concerned Magistrate Court. On account of

the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case as well.         So they have no other remedy

except to approach this Court seeking the following relief:

            to   quash   the    proceedings   against   the

     petitioners/accused 1 to 3 pursuant to Annexure A final

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014             3

     report in Crime No.254/2013 registered by Thamarassery

     Police Station now pending befroe the Judicial First Class

     Magistrate Court-I, Thamarassery as C.C.No.578/2013 in

     the interest of justice.


      4. Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties due to the intervention of community leaders and

on account of the settlement, he does not want to

prosecute the case and he filed Annexure B affidavit

stating these facts.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that

in view of the settlement, there is no possibility of any

conviction and so he prayed for allowing the application.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that except these cases

there is no other case between these parties and it was a

clash between two groups of same community and in such

cases the power under Section 482 of the Code need not

be invoked to quash the proceedings.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014        4

statement given by the second respondent, Thamarassery

police has registered Crime No. 254/2013 of that police

station     against    the  petitioners alleging  offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      8. After investigation, Annexure A final report was

filed and the case was taken on file as C.C.No.578/2013

and now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Thamarassery. Now the matter has been settled

between the parties.      It is an admitted fact that both

these accused as well as the de fcto complainant belong

to same community namely muslim community.         Due to

some political ideological difference, there was some split

in the community and they showed the allegiance to the

Indian Muslim League party and SSF party respectively

and then difference of opinion arose and clashes occurred

and some other cases have been registered in respect of

these incidents.       Now the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of mediators

and well wishers and the party leaders and community

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014        5

leaders so as to bring harmony among the members of

the community. It is true that the people are now

forgetting the fact the religion is intended for the welfare

of the people and they should not be over governed by

the religion. They are only expected to follow the

preachings of the religion to lead a perfect life. But that

principle is being violated and this is being misused for

their personal purposes which resulted in clashes like this

causing difference of opinion among the same community

as well.    It   is true that such fanatic vandalism in the

name of religion should not be encouraged as submitted

by the learned Public Prosecutor. But considering the fact

that settlement has been arrived at due to the

intervention of all the persons concerned in the same

community to bring harmony among the members of the

community and on account of the settlement, there is no

possibility of any conviction as well as none of the

prosecution witnesses will support the case of the

prosecution and conviction of such cases will be remote,

there is no purpose in proceeding with the case as it will

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014             6

amount to wastage of judicial time alone.

      9. Further the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above

       discussion can be summarised thus: the power of

       the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding

       or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent

       jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

       given to a criminal court for compounding the

       offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power

       is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

       it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

       engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends

       of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

       any Court.     In what cases power to quash the

       criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

       exercised where the offender and victim have

       settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

       circumstances of each case and no category can be

       prescribed.     However, before exercise of such

       power, the High Court must have due regard to the

       nature and gravity of the crime.         Heinous and

       serious offences of mental depravity or offences

       like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

       quashed even though the victim or victim's family

       and the offender have settled the dispute. Such

       offences are not private in nature and have serious

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014             7

       impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise

       between the victim and offender in relation to the

       offences under special statutes like Prevention of

       Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

       servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot

       provide for any basis for quashing criminal

       proceedings involving such offences.        But the

       criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

       dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

       for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

       offences    arising  from    commercial,   financial,

       mercantile,   civil,    partnership   or  such   like

       transactions   or   the   offences  arising  out   of

       matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

       disputes where the wrong is basically private or

       personal in nature and the parties have resolved

       their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

       Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its

       view, because of the compromise between the

       offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

       remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

       would put accused to great oppression and

       prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to

       him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

       and complete settlement and compromise with the

       victim.   In other words, the High Court must

       consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to

       the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

       proceeding     or   continuation   of  the   criminal

       proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process

       of law despite settlement and compromise between

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014             8

       the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure

       the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

       case is put to end and if the answer to the above

       question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

       be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

       proceeding."




      10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a clash

between the same community people and on account of

the settlement, harmony has been brought in among the

community people hoping that this will lead a better

future and avoid unnecessary tension in the locality and in

view of the settlement conviction will be remote, this

Court feels that the power under Section 482 of the Code

can be invoked to quash the proceedings in order to

promote the settlement which this Court, hope and

believe, has brought harmony among the people belong

to the same community and further clashes in the locality

will be avoided in future on account of this settlement and

they will try to live on the belief that religion is for their

benefit and it should not be used as a weapon to promote

Crl.M.C.No.2767 of 2014         9

fanaticism and bring hatredness among the same

community people and others as well.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.578/2013 (Crime No.254/2013 of Thamarassery

Police Station pending before the Judicial First class

Magistrate's Court - I, Thamarassery        as against the

petitioners is hereby quashed.

         Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary action.

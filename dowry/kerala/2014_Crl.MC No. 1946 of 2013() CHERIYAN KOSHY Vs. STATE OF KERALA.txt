                          P.D. RAJAN, J.
              ========================
                    Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013
              --------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 27th day of May, 2014

                              ORDER

       This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash

Annexure D charge framed by the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Thiruvalla against the petitioner in C.C. 484/2009 pending

before the above Court. The petitioner is the first accused in the

above case which was filed under Section 498 A read with section

34 of IPC by the second respondent. The petitioner appeared

before the Court on 4.4.2013 as per summons and was enlarged

on bail. On the same day itself, the learned Magistrate framed

Annexure D charge without considering the mandatory provisions

under Section 273 of the Cr.P.C., which is the right of the

petitioner to take all evidence in his presence.            Without

complying such procedural formalities, Annexure D charge was

framed. If the trial is proceeded based upon Annexure D, much

prejudice will be caused to him and it is contended that trial will

be vitiated by non compliance of the above provisions.         The

petitioner also contended that there is violation of the direction

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013      -2-

issued by this Court in Crl. M.C. No. 3336/2009 dated 19.1.2010

and hence he prays to invoke the inherent jurisdiction by

quashing Annexure D.

       2.   The second respondent's allegation in the aforesaid

complaint was that the petitioner married the second respondent

as per the Christian religious rites and that the petitioner ill-

treated her both physically and mentally, demanding more

amount as dowry. In the circumstances she filed the aforesaid

compliant before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Thiruvalla. This was sent for investigation under Section 156(3)

of Cr.P.C which was registered as Crime No. 307/2004 of

Thiruvalla Police Station.    On completing investigation, final

report was filed only against the second accused as per C.C. No.

312/2005 before the JFCM, Thiruvalla. In the circumstances R2

filed this complaint against other accused including A2 and A3

which is under trial in that Court.      The learned Magistrate

examined PW1 and PW2 on 18.1.2013 and 1.2.2013 and

petitioner received summons only on 4.4.2013. On the same day

itself Annexure D charge was framed. This matter was brought

to the notice of the Court on 17.4.2013. In the circumstances

petitioner approached this Court.

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013          -3-

       3.   Before considering the arguments advanced by both

counsel, it is relevant to extract Section 244 of Cr.P.C.

                 "244. Evidence for prosecution. - (1) When, in any

          warrant-case instituted otherwise than on a police report,

          the accused appears or is brought before a Magistrate, the

          Magistrate shall proceed to hear the prosecution and take

          all such evidence as may be produced in support of the

          prosecution.

                 (2) The Magistrate may, on the application of the

          prosecution, issue a summons to any of its witnesses

          directing him to attend or to produce any document or

          other thing."

According to the above Section, in a case instituted otherwise

than on a police report, when the accused is brought before the

Magistrate, the Magistrate shall proceed to hear the prosecution

and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the

prosecution.       The Magistrate may, on application of the

prosecution or de-facto complainant issue summons to other

witnesses directing to attend or to produce any document or

other things as demanded.            It is the power of the judicial

Magistrate to record evidence after appearance of the accused

brought before him.

       4. In this case, after getting summons, the third accused

appeared and took bail.         The petitioner appeared before the

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013       -4-

Magistrate only on 4.4.2013 and on the same day itself learned

Magistrate framed a charge.        The recording of evidence was

started before appearance of the petitioner. According to Section

244 of the Cr.P.C, when accused appears or brought before the

Magistrate, he is required to hear the prosecution and to take

such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution.

The word 'hear' in this matter clearly indicates that the Court

shall have to give right of audience to the prosecution regarding

the evidence that it wants to produce.       The words "may be

produced" clearly say about the liberty of determining the order

of evidence which is the choice of the prosecution. Therefore, the

Magistrate is required to take all evidence that may be produced

by the prosecution in the presence of the accused or his pleader

and he cannot pass any order of discharge or frame charge

without hearing the accused. At this stage, the Magistrate need

only consider the prima facie evidence with regard to the

allegation.     Only after considering that aspect and taking all

evidence under Section 244, the Magistrate has power to

discharge him, if no case is made out against him.    When such

evidence has been taken at the previous stage of the case and if

the Magistrate is of the opinion that there is ground for

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013          -5-

presuming that the accused has committed any offence triable in

a case instituted otherwise than on police report, he shall frame

in writing a charge against the accused. Here the petitioner has

a right to hear under Section 244 which was not done by the

learned Magistrate. According to Section 273 of the Cr.P.C, all

evidence taken in the course shall be taken in the presence of

accused or in the presence of his pleader if his personal

attendance is dispensed with. Here on the date of appearance

itself, without hearing the petitioner Annexure D charge was

framed which is in violation of Section 244 and 245 of Cr.P.C.

Therefore the petitioner is to be heard before framing the charge.

       5. There is also another direction by this Court in Crl.M.C

No.3336/2009.         Paragraph '6' of the said Crl.M.C reads as

follows:

                  "6.  Though learned counsel challenged the

            materials, based on which the cognizance was

            taken, it is for the petitioner to raise these

            contentions before the Magistrate at the time of

            hearing under Section 245 of Code of Criminal

            Procedure, after recording the evidence of the

            complainant and his witnesses, as provided under

            Section 244 of Code of Criminal Procedure."

The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013                -6-

violation of the above aspects are clear from Annexure B and C

documents which are the extract of the proceedings before the

JFCM, Thiruvalla. The learned counsel appearing for the

respondents has also no dispute with regard to the above

procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate. Hence this is a fit

case to invoke inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the

Cr.P.C.

       6. According to Section 482 of the Cr.P.C, the inherent

jurisdiction can be invoked to prevent abuse of process of Court

to make such orders as may be necessary or to give effect to any

order or to secure ends of justice. In State of Haryana v.

Bhajanlal (1992 SCC Crl. 426) Apex Court held as follows:

                      "(1) Where the allegations in the FIR/complaint,

              even if they are taken at their face value do not prima facie

              constitute any offence against the accused.         (2)

              Where the allegations in the FIR of other materials do not

              constitute a cognizable offence justifying an investigation

              by the police under Section 156(1) of the code except

              under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section

              155(2). (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations in the

              FIR/complaint and the evidence collected thereon do not

              disclose the commission of any offence.       (4) Where the

              allegations in the FIR/complaint do not constitute any

              cognizable offence but constitute only non-cognizable

              offence to which no investigation is permitted by the police

              without the order of Magistrate under Section 155(2).

Crl. M.C. No. 1946 of 2013                 -7-

              (5) Where the allegations are so absurd and inherently

              improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can

              ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground

              for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an

              express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the

              Code    or   the  Statute   concerned     (under  which  the

              proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance

              of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific

              provision in the code or in the statute concerned, providing

              efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.

              (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with

              mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously

              instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on

              the accuse with a view to spite him due to private and

              personal vengeance."

  Therefore, the facts and circumstances of this case shows that

Annexure D charge framed by the learned Magistrate is to be

quashed.

       7.   Hence I quash Annexure D and direct the learned

Magistrate to hear the petitioner and to give him an opportunity

to take all contentions under Section 244 and 245 as per law. If

petitioner wishes to cross examine the witnesses at that stage,

the Magistrate is at liberty to consider that also.

       This petition is allowed.


                                                                P.D. RAJAN,
                                                                   JUDGE.

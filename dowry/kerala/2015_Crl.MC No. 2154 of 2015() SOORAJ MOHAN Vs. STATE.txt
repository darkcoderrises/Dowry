                    Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015
               ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015

                              ORDER

      Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 3 in Crime No. 617/2009

of Kayamkulam Police Station in C.C. No. 811/2009 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam pending in

Crl. A. No. 394/2012 and Crl. A. No. 431/2012 on the file of the

Additional Sessions Court-I, Mavelikkara. The learned Magistrate

took cognizance of the offences under Sections 341, 323 and 498

(A) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, based on a private

complaint filed by the second respondent. Now, it is submitted on

behalf of the petitioners that the entire dispute between the

petitioners and the second respondent has already been settled

and the second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit which is

produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A5. Therefore, the

prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash Annexure-A1 and A2 FIR and

Final Report in Crime No. 617/2009 of Kayamkulam Police

Station and the conviction in Annexure A3 judgment in

C.C. No. 811/2009 on the file of the Judicial First         Class

Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam pending in Crl. A. No. 394/2012

Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015             2

and Crl. A. No. 431/2012 on the file of the Additional Sessions

Court-I, Mavelikkara as against the Petitioners in the light of

Annexure-A5 Compromise entered into between the parties.

      2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the

learned counsel for the second respondent.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is

of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015            3

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in

nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in that

capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal

proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a

different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly offences

arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or

such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial

relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is

basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of cases, High

Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015              4

Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of

the compromise between the offender and the victim, the

possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

criminal   case    despite   full and   complete   settlement   and

compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court may

consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

to the above question is in affirmative the High Court shall be well

within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 498A

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015            5

     5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the second respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second

respondent has also stated that the second respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.

The second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this

Court as Annexure A5 in this regard.

     6.    In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime No.

617/2009 of Kayamkulam Police Station in C.C. No. 811/2009 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- Kayamkulam

pending in Crl. A. No. 394/2012 and Crl. A. No. 431/2012 on the

file of the Additional Sessions Court-I, Mavelikkara can be

quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid

down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in Crime No. 617/2009 of Kayamkulam Police Station

and in C.C. No. 811/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Crl.M.C. No. 2154 of 2015            6

Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam pending in Crl. A. No. 394/2012

and Crl. A. No. 431/2012 on the file of the Additional Sessions

Court-I, Mavelikkara against the petitioners are quashed.

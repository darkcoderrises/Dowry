                 C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012
             ===========================
            Dated this the 19th day of June 2012

                         O R D E R


           This revision petition is nothing but a last ditch

effort of the defacto complainant to save her matrimonial

tie. The circumstances beckon a brief narration of the facts.

The revision petitioner/the defacto complainant is married to

the son of the 1st respondent/1st accused. Alleging malefic

manners on the part of the father-in-law viz; the first

respondent herein the revision petitioner lodged a complaint

against him alleging commission of offences punishable

under sections 324 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code.

Accordingly, Crime No. 478/11 was registered in Payyoli

Police Station containing damnation under Sections 324

and 308 of IPC. During the course of its investigation itself

interference by their kinsmen brought about a compromise

between     the  parties.   Soon,    the   petitioner herein

approached this court by filing Criminal M.C.No. 5533/2011

for quashing the First Information Report. Essentially, the

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012        -2-



contention was that since the disputes were settled between

the parties and that was duly intimated to the police further

investigation based on the FIR would only be a futile

exercise and no useful purpose could be served by allowing

the FIR to remain.       An affidavit to that effect was also filed

in the said Criminal M.C. Having found that investigation is

the province of the police and at that stage, this court could

not take cognizance of such an affidavit and to quash the

further proceedings which are pending investigation the said

case was disposed of as per Annexure-I order with a

direction to the investigating officer to complete the

investigation and to file a final report within six weeks from

the date of receipt of copy of that order. The petitioner was

also directed to furnish a copy of the order to the

investigating officer.

            2.     The investigating officer went on with the

investigation and laid Annexure-II        final report before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyoli charge

sheeting the 1st respondent herein for commission of

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012        -3-



offences under Sections 324 and 308 IPC. Thereupon, the

learned Magistrate considered the final report and the

materials sent along with and took cognizance of offences

punishable      under    Sections  324   and   308  IPC    and

commenced committal proceedings as C.P.No. 14 of 2012.

During its course the learned Magistrate issued a non-

bailable warrant to the first respondent/first accused.    This

revision petition has been filed in the above circumstances

with the prayer to call for the records and to set aside the

order in C.P.No. 14/2012 taking cognizance of the offences

under Sections 324 and 308 by the learned Magistrate.

            3. The facts expatiated above would reveal that

the defacto complainant herself now, seeks for an abrupt

termination of the proceedings after setting the law in motion

all by herself. Now, Criminal M.A. No. 4178 of 2012 has

been filed by the revision petitioner under Section 482

Cr.P.C. with the prayer to stay all further proceedings in C.P.

No. 14/2012 on the file of the Munsiff Magistrate Court,

Perambra.       The affidavit accompanying the said petition

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012      -4-



succinctly explains all the developments and circumstances

since the lodging of the complaint. As noticed hereinbefore,

the revision petitioner     had   earlier filed an affidavit in

Crl.M.C. No. 3388/2011 regarding the settlement of the

dispute     between      the parties.      All the    attending

circumstances are narrated in detail by the petitioner to

contend that non-interference by this court at this stage,

would ultimately result in miscarriage of justice. It is evident

that the learned Magistrate took cognizance of offences

under Section 324 & 308 Indian Penal Code against the 1st

accused.       The said offences are non- compoundable in

terms of the provisions under Section 320 Cr.P.C.

Therefore, there is no question of granting permission to

compound such non compoundable offences as any such

order would violate the statutory provision.      The question

therefore, is whether the proceedings could be terminated,

in the circumstances, invoking the inherent jurisdiction of

this court under Section 482, Cr.P.C.

            4. Now, I may consider the question regarding the

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012      -5-



scope of exercise of the inherent power under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure in circumstances like the

one on hand. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana reported in 2003 (2) KLT

1062 (SC) assumes relevance in this context. In that case

the husband was one of the appellants and the wife was the

second respondent and their marriage was solemnized on

21-7-1999.      They were living separately since, 15-7-2000

and the F.I.R. was registered at wife's instance on 2-1-2002

under Sections 498 A, 323 and 406, I.P.C. During pendency

of the criminal case the dispute between the husband and

wife and their family members were settled. Then, the wife

filed an affidavit stating that her dispute with the husband

and the other members of his family had been finally settled

and she and her husband had agreed for mutual divorce.

Thereupon both the parties approached the High Court and

jointly sought for quashing the criminal proceedings

launched against the husband and his family members

based on the aforesaid F.I.R. The High Court dismissed the

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012       -6-



petition holding the view that as offences under Section 498

A and 406, I.P.C. being non-compoundable the inherent

powers under Section 482 of the Code could not be invoked

to by-pass Section 320 Cr.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court

held that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers

could quash criminal proceedings or F.I.R. or complaint and

Section 320, Cr.P.C. would not and could not limit or affect

the powers under Section 482 of the Code. Paragraphs 14

and 15 of the said decision read thus:-

       "14. There is no doubt that the object of introducing

Chapter XX-A containing S. 498 A in the Indian Penal Code was to

prevent the torture to a woman by her husband or by relatives of

her husband. S. 498 A was added with a view to punishing a

husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to

coerce her or her relative to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry.

The hyper-technical view would be counter productive and would

act against interests of women and against the object for which

this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-

exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the

ends of justice would prevent women from setting earlier. That is

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012         -7-



no the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal Code.

      15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that in the

High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal

proceedings or FIR or complaint and S. 320 of the Code does not

limit or affect the powers under S. 482 of the Code".      In the

decision in Pankajkumar v. State of Maharashtra reported

in 2008 Crl.L.J. 3944 while considering the scope and ambit

of powers of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C; or

Article 227 of the Constitution of India the Hon'ble Supreme

Court held that powers possessed by the High Courts under

the said provisions are very wide but these should be

exercised only in appropriate cases; ex debitio justitiae to do

real and substantial justice for the administration of which

alone courts exist.

            5.     In the context of this case, the decision of a

Division Bench of this Court in Thankamma Vs. State of

Kerala reported in         2006 KLT 846 also assumes much

relevance. That was a case wherein at the instance of the

wife,   offences punishable under Sections 498 A, 506 (1),

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012     -8-



342, 323 & 324 r/w. Sec. 34 of Indian Penal Code were

charged against the relatives of the husband and the trial

court found them guilty under Section 498 A, 506 (1), 342,

323 r/w. Sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.    The conviction

entered and sentence imposed on them by the trial Court

were confirmed by the Appellate Court. Later, Criminal

Revision Petition No. 2367/2005 was filed by the defacto

complainant viz; the wife against the judgment of the

appellate court and she filed an application for permission

for compounding the offences.     After considering the legal

bar in Sub Section (9) of Section 320, this court found that a

non-compoundable offence could not be compounded.          At

the same time, the Division Bench considered          another

application filed as Crl. M.A. No. 7103/2006 under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal

proceedings. The Division Bench found that the husband

and wife had re-united and are living peacefully with their

daughter and their family members. It was submitted that in

the said circumstances, giving effect to the sentences

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012         -9-



imposed against her mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-

in-law to undergo simple imprisonment for one year might

again result in astringency in the matrimonial tie.                In

paragraph 12 & 13 of the said judgment the Division Bench

held thus :

             " 12. The courts have generally taken a liberal attitude

for compounding the offences committed by spouse as well as

their relations in matrimonial disputes. The legislative mandate of

reconciliation by courts is reflected in 23 (2) of the Hindu Marriage

Act, 1955 and various other legislations dealing with personnel

laws. The apex court in V.K. Gupta v. Smt. Nirmala Gupta ((1979)

4 SCC 258) reminded the courts that it is fundamental that

reconciliation of a ruptured marriage is the first essay of the

Judge, aided by counsel in their noble adventure. Court alerted

that the sanctity of marriage is in essence, the foundation of

civilization and, therefore, court and counsel owe a duty to

society to strain to the utmost to repair the snapped relation

between the parties. When the parties are seeking to compound

the offence under S. 498-A of the IPC the approach of the court

would be to save the institution of marriage since the sanctity of

marriage is a cornerstone of civilisation and to bring peace and

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012       -10-



happiness in the society.



            13. Courts have however, to be guarded that S. 482 is

not misused so as to compound the offence under S. 498-A

which is otherwise non-compoundable.           The court should

examine whether request is bona fide and not intended to get out

of the clutches of law. Each case has to be decided on the facts

and circumstances of that case. Courts must see that the power

of the court under S. 482 is not misused. We are therefore of the

view that this court cannot exercise the powers under S.397

Cr.P.C. so as to compound a non-compoundable offence under S.

320 Cr.P.C. and in appropriate cases the courts could exercise its

inherent powers under S. 482 to save the institution of marriage. "

            6.    It is thus obvious that after considering the

over all situation, the Division Bench found therein that the

courts would have to save the institution of marriage as the

sanctity of marriage is a corner stone of civilization and to

bring peace and happiness in the society.         In the case on

hand, petitioner who set the law in motion by lodging a

complaint that ultimately resulted in laying of a charge

against her father-in-law later, re-united with her estranged

husband      and      now,  seeks  for  quashing      the   entire

proceedings against her father-in-law to preserve and protect

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012       -11-



the institution of marriage. Indubitably, marriage as a social

institution is considered solemn and sacred all over the

civilized word and therefore, courts have and owe a duty to

redeem the parties from volatile and vulnerable situations

like the one on hand.      There is yet another aspect as well.

The invaluable time of the court has to be saved whenever

and wherever it is possible and compelling parties to

continue to prosecute the case, the continuation of which

has become unnecessary would certainly end in futility. In a

case of this nature, in view of the reconciliation there is not

even a       remote possibility of the defacto complainant

deposing against the accused with a view to fetch him a

conviction.      I have no hesitation to say, in the totality

circumstances, that allowing continuance of the proceedings

based on Crime No. 478/2011 of Payyoli Police Station any

further would result in miscarriage of justice and also would

result in abuse of process of Court. In this case, it is to be

noted,     earlier,    even in Crl. M.C. No. 4453/2011, the

revision petitioner herein/defacto complainant,       filed an

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012       -12-



affidavit stating that the issue between the petitioner and the

1st respondent herein that led to the registration of Crime No.

478/2011 of Payyoli Police Station was settled. That fact

was also duly intimated to the investigating officer as well.

Even, in this revision petition essentially the prayer of the

petitioner is to terminate the proceedings before the Munsiff

Court, Payyoli which is pending before that court as C.P.No.

14 of 2012 to save the institution of marriage. True that in

view of Annexure II and the materials available before the

court along with the report under Section 173 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, the learned Magistrate is          perfectly

justified in taking cognizance of offences under Section 324

& 308 against the accused. Therefore, the prayer of the

petitioner to set aside the action culminated in taking

cognizance of the offences under Section 324 and 308

against the 1st respondent/accused cannot be upheld. The

learned Magistrate and also the Court to which case is to be

committed, if continuation of the committal proceedings is

allowed,    cannot consider the prayer now, made by the

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012      -13-



petitioner herein. As noticed earlier, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in B.S. Joshi's case (Supra) took note of the intent in

the introduction of Chapter XX-A containing Section 498-A,

in the Indian Penal Code and held non-exercise of inherent

powers involving allegation of commission of offence under

Section 498-A on settlement of dispute by the wife would

prevent the wife from settling in life and in such

circumstances, it would defeat the very purpose of its

introduction. In view of the position of law obtained from the

decisions referred (Supra) and the position of fact obtained

from the specific averments of the petitioner, the defacto

complainant I have no doubt that non-exercise of inherent

power under Section 482 Cr.P.C would prevent the petitioner

in settling safely with her husband. Therefore, I am of the

considered view that this is an eminently fit case wherein

this court should invoke the inherent power to do real and

substantial justice and the fact that it is the de facto

complainant who seeks such a relief is no ground for

declining its exercise.

C RL. R.P. NO. 1220/2012        -14-



            7.      In the said circumstances, to save the

institution of marriage and to secure ends of justice, I am

inclined to exercise the inherent power under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure and accordingly the F.I.R. in

Crime No. 478/2011 of Payyoli Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it before the Munsiff Magistrate Court,

Payyoli are quashed.

            This Revision Petition is accordingly, allowed.

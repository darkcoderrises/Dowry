               Dated this the 21st day of March, 2014

                            O R D E R




      This is an application filed by accused Nos.    1 to 4 in C.P.

No. 7/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court

- I, Kochi to quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that Annexure A2 First

Information Report was registered as Crime No. 1648/2011 of

Narakkal    Police Station on the basis of Annexure A1           first

information statement given by first respondent as de facto

complainant while he was aged only 16 years alleging offences

under Sections 294(b), 341, 323 read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code and after investigation, Annexure A3         final report

was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Kochi

where it was originally taken on file as C.C.No. 19/2013.

Thereafter in view of notification issued by the State Government

constituting Principal Sessions Court       as a Special Court for

trying offences relating to children and their rights under Section

Crl.M.C. No. 1676 of 2014
                                         2

25 of the Commission for Protection of Child Right Act, 2005,

the case was converted to C.P. No. 7/2014 by the learned

Magistrate.

         3. Now the matter has been settled between the parties,

the injured has become              a major and he has no      grievance

against the petitioners now. Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature,              they could not file the application

before         the court below and the Magistrate         Court will not

consider the application as now it has become an offence trial by

Sessions Court. So petitioners have no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following reliefs:

                  "Hence     it   is humbly prayed that this

                  Honourable Court may be pleased to quash

                  the FIR   and Charge sheet and all further

                  proceedings in C.P.. No.7/2014 on the file of

                  the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -I,

                  Kochi for which act of kindness           the

                  petitioner shall as in duty bound every pray".

         4.       The 1st respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the             matter has been settled between the

parties and there is no existing dispute between them and he

does not want to prosecute the case in view of the settlement

Crl.M.C. No. 1676 of 2014
                                        3

arrived at due to the intervention of friends,             relatives and

mediators.

         5.     The learned counsel for the petitioners  also submitted

that no purpose will be served in proceeding with the case in

view of the settlement.

         6. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor on

instructions, as directed by this Court submitted that except this

case there is no other case against the petitioners and being a

case involving child's right the case should not be quashed.

         7. It is an admitted fact that           the above crime was

registered           on the basis of the   statement  given by the    1st

respondent herein while he was a child, aged 16 years, when

he was alleged to be attacked by the petitioners               and after

investigation final report was filed and it was originally taken on

file as C.C.No. 19/2013 on the file of           the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - I, Kochi.

         8. After the establishment of the Special Courts under

Section 25 of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights

Act, 2005, it has become a case triable by principal sessions

court and so             the learned Magistrate converted the same as

Crl.M.C. No. 1676 of 2014
                                          4

C.P.No.7/2014            and it is pending before that Court. It is at that

time that the matter has been settled between the parties. Now

the injured has become a major. The matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of friends.

         9. Further it is alleged in the affidavit that on account of the

settlement,            their relationship has been restored and there is no

enmity between them now and they have become friends.

         10. Though for the purpose of trial of offences against

child and child rights, taking note of the fact that children are

being exploited and abused on account of their tender age and

their       rights are not being protected by the society,         Special

Courts were constituted to try such offences                and Principal

Sessions Court has been designated for that purpose. But at

the same time, if the child has become major and if he had

compounded the case with                  the accused persons in order to

promote harmony between them, then that cannot be curtailed

by the Courts merely because               this has become a case triable

by Sessions Court. Further in view of the settlement, there is no

possibility          of any conviction being entered into     against the

accused persons as well as the de facto complainant or his

Crl.M.C. No. 1676 of 2014
                                           5

witnesses are not going to support the case of the prosecution.

         11.       In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

                  "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
         be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
         criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
         given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
         justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled      their dispute  would  depend    on   the  facts  and
         circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
         However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
         have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
         Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
         like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
         even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
         settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
         have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
         between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
         under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
         offences committed by public servants while working in that
         capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
         proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
         having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
         on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
         the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
         of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
         where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
         the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
         of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
         view, because of the compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

Crl.M.C. No. 1676 of 2014
                                           6

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
         complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
         words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
         or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
         criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
         would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
         and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
         whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
         criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
         question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
         its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

         12. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and               that has,       in fact, restored    their

companionship and now they are living happily in cordial terms,

pendency of this case should not be a hurdle to continue such

relationship.            Since the   matter has been settled between the

parties, the possibility          of conviction is also remote as neither

the de facto complainant                 or his witnesses will support the

case of the prosecution as well and allowing the case to continue

will only be a wastage of judicial time.

         13. So considering the circumstances, this Court feel

that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has                to be       invoked     to     quash the

proceedings to promote the settlement and harmony that has

been restored between the parties. So the application is allowed

Njarakkal Police Station pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - I, Kochi as against the petitioners is quashed.

         Office is directed to communicate this order          to the court

concerned               immediately for     necessary further action in this

regard.

                 Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 17th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is an accused in Crime No.187

of 2000 of Perunad Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 323, 324 & 427 r/w

Section 149 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash all proceedings in

Annexure 1 L.P. No.44/2006 before the JFCM, Ranni, as the

matter is settled out of court.

        2.      The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner, who was a member of the unlawful assembly

trespassed in to the house of the defacto complainant and

slapped, kicked and hit with bricks on him and pelted stones on

the house of the CW 1 to 3. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.  The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
                                 2

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, who are the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 323,

324 & 427 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.     It is

Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
                                   3

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from

          the above discussion can be summarised

          thus:      the power of the High Court in

          quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

          power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of

          the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

          has to be exercised in accord with the

Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
                                 4

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases      power   to quash   the    criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes      of quashing,  particularly the

          offences      arising  from      commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
                                  5

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its   view,    because  of   the compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

Crl.M.C.No. 2418 of 2013
                                6

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -1 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No. 187/2000 of Perunad Police Station

and all further proceedings thereto.

                         Crl. M.C. No.5055 of 2013
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 14th day of March, 2014


                                      O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is field by the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime No.781/2013 of

Kalady Police Station, registered on the basis of the

statement given by the additional 3rd respondent, alleging

offence under Section 506(i) of Indian Penal Code. After

investigation, final report has been filed. The petitioner filed

the petition originally for quashing the first information

report registered in respect of this incident. Later it is seen

from the statement of the investigating officer that,

investigation was completed and final report was field. On

that basis a report was called for and the petitioner filed

this criminal miscellaneous case, seeking the following

relief:

Crl. M.C. No.5055 of 2013
                                    2




             "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court
      may be pleased to quash the entire proceedings in Crime
      No.781/2013, pursuant to Annexure-A FIR of the Kalady
      Police Station, in the interests of justice."

            2.     Later the additional 3rd respondent was

impleaded, who is the defacto-complainant as per order in

Crl.M.A.No.2471/2014. He entered appearance through

counsel and also field affidavit, as Annexure-B, stating that,

the matter has been settled and he has no objection in

quashing the proceedings.

            3.     The learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that, except this case, there is no other case against the

petitioner.

            4.     It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the defacto-complainant/additional 3rd

respondent, Crime No.781/2013 of Kalady Police Station

was registered against the petitioner, alleging offence

under Section 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code. It was at that

Crl. M.C. No.5055 of 2013
                                3

time, the petitioner filed this petition to quash the further

proceedings on the basis of that first information report.

When the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, final

report has already been field and a report has called for

from      the   Judicial  First   Class    Magistrate    Court-I,

Perumbavoor, and a report has been received, in which it

has stated that, final report has been filed in the case and it

was taken on file as C.C.No.2316/2013 and summons has

been issued to the accused to appear on 17.07.2014. It is at

that time, the matter has been settled between the parties

and the defacto-complainant entered appearance through

counsel, on his impleadment as additional respondent and

field Annexure-B affidavit.

            5.    In the decision reported Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it reads as

follows:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in

Crl. M.C. No.5055 of 2013
                                    4

      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and
      different from the power given to a criminal court for
      compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
      limitation but has to be exercised in accord with the
      guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of
      any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal
      proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where
      the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an
      no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise
      of such power, the High Court must have due regard to
      the nature and gravity of the crime.         Heinous and
      serious   offences of mental depravity or offences like
      murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
      even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
      offender in relation to the offences under special statutes
      like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
      committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the
      criminal    cases   having    overwhelmingly    and    pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
      the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
      arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences
      arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
      family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
      quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
      compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

Crl. M.C. No.5055 of 2013
                                    5

      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation     of the    criminal    proceedings   would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
      that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."

            6.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the matter has

been settled between the parties and no purpose will be

served by allowing the prosecution to continue, in view of

the settlement and it will only amount to wastage of judicial

time, so, this court feels that, it is a fit case, where the

power under Section 482 of the Code has to be invoked to

quash further proceedings to promote the settlement

entered into between the parties, due to the intervention of

mediators. So, the application is allowed and further

proceedings in C.C.No.2316/2013 (Crime No.781/2013 of

Kalady Police Station) on the file of the Judicial First Class

                                  6

Magistrate Court No-I, Perumbavoor, as against the

petitioner is quashed. Office is directed to communicate

this order to the concerned court for necessary further

action in this regard.

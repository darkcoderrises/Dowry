                    Crl.M.C. No.1807 of 2015
                   -------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of April 2015


                              O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 10 in C.C. No.238 of 2008

on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal and

accused Nos.1, 2, 4 and 6 to 12 in Crime No.174 of 2005 of

Kilimanoor Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram.            The learned

Magistrate took cognizance of the offences under Sections 143,

147, 148, 451, 506(i), 427 and 294(b) r/w 149 of Indian Penal

Code, based on a private complaint filed by the second

respondent. The petitioners have also impleaded other victims as

additional respondents 4 to 6 in this petition.            Now, it is

submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the entire disputes

between the petitioners and respondents 2 and 3 and additional

respondents 4 to 6 have already been settled and respondents 2

and 3 and additional respondents 4 to 6 have also sworn affidavits

to that effect, which are produced along with Crl.M.C. as

Annexures B, C, D, E and F.            Therefore, the prayer in this

Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in C.C. No.238 of

2008 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Crl.M.C. No.1807 of 2015

                                -: 2 :-

Attingal and in Crime No.174 of 2005 of Kilimanoor Police

Station, Thiruvananthapuram as against the petitioners.

      2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the

learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 and 3 and additional

respondents 4 to 6.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is

of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accordance with the guidelines engrafted in such

power viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse

of the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

Crl.M.C. No.1807 of 2015

                               -: 3 :-

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in

nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on

a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where

the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of

cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,

because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,

the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

Crl.M.C. No.1807 of 2015

                                -: 4 :-

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,

451, 506(i), 427 and 294(b) r/w 149 of Indian Penal Code.

      5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and respondents 2 and 3 and additional

respondents 4 to 6 has already been settled amicably and the

learned counsel appearing for the private respondents has also

stated that the private respondents did not want to prosecute the

criminal case against the petitioners.      They have also sworn

Crl.M.C. No.1807 of 2015

                                -: 5 :-

Annexures B, C, D, E and F affidavits before this Court in this

regard.

      6.    In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C. No.238 of

2008 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Attingal and in Crime No.174 of 2005 of Kilimanoor Police

Station, Thiruvananthapuram can be quashed by this Court

invoking the powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, in the light of the principles laid down by the Apex

Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

            In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C. No.238 of 2008 on the file of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal and in Crime No.174 of 2005

of Kilimanoor Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, as against the

petitioners is quashed.

                  B.A.No.5432 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 25th day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

    Apprehending arrest in Crime No.910/14 of Chavara

Police  Station,  the    accused      therein   preferred  this

application under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

     2. The prosecution allegation is that the 1st petitioner

married the de facto complainant on 5.2.2005 and during

the wedlock, two children were born and while the de facto

complainant was residing in her matrimonial home, she

was subjected to cruelty, demanding more dowry. Thus

according to the prosecution, the accused 3 in numbers

have committed the offences punishable under           sections

498A, 323 r/w 34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

B.A.No.5432 of 2014
                                2

that the present crime is registered only to harass the

petitioners, since a very serious matrimonial dispute is

pending between the de facto complainant and the 1st

petitioner. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted

that, against the petitioners, there is only general

allegations. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it appears to me that custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is not necessary when the

prosecution has no case that the petitioners had used any

weapon against the de facto complainant. If that be so,

according to me, this petition can be allowed, but on

stringent conditions to safeguard the interest of the

prosecution.

      In the result, this petition is allowed and there will be

a direction that in the event of arrest of the petitioners

connected with Crime No.910/14 of Chavara Police Station,

they shall be released on bail on each of them executing a

bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the

B.A.No.5432 of 2014
                                  3

like amount to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer

in the above crime and on the following other conditions :

             1. The 1st petitioner is directed to report before the
             Investigating Officer in the above Crime between 10
             and 11 a.m. on every Sundays once in a fortnight.
             The 2nd and 3rd petitioners shall report before the
             Investigating Officer as and when required.

            2.    The  petitioners  shall   co-operate   with   the
            investigation and they shall not interfere with the
            same or attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper
            the evidence.

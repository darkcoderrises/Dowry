                     Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014
                   ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014.

                              O R D E R


      The petitioners herein are the accused in the impugned

Annexure-A1 FIR in Crime No.561/2012 of Valiyamala Police

Station, Thiruvananthapuram District alleging offences under

Secs. 294(b), 324, 341 r/w 34 IPC.                 The police after

investigation    filed   the     impugned      Annexure-A2    Final

Report/Charge Sheet in the impugned Annexure-A1 Crime

No.561/2012 of Valiyamala Police Station which has led to

pendency of calendar case, C.C.No.63/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Nedumangad. The brief

of the prosecution case is that the petitioners assaulted

respondents 3 & 4 herein with a knife and inflicted minor

injuries at about 8:30 p.m. on 17.11.2012 and thereby

committed the offences under Secs. 294(b), 324, 341 r/w 34

IPC.    It is stated that the entire disputes between the

petitioners and the contesting respondents have been settled.

The contesting respondents 3 & 4 have filed separate affidavits

dated 3.12.2014, produced as Annexures A3 & A4 respectively

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

in this Crl.M.C., stating that the incident which led to the

registration  of   the  impugned    Crime      No.561/2012     of

Valiayamala Police Station occurred due to misunderstanding

between the petitioners herein and the contesting respondents

3 & 4 have settled the disputes between the petitioners and

that respondents 3 & 4 have no objection in the termination of

the impugned criminal proceedings pending against the

petitioners and that they have not sustained any serious

injuries in the crime and that they are not interested to

continue the criminal proceedings against the petitioners any

further.    It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances that the petitioners have filed the instant

Crl.M.C invoking the inherent powers conferred on this Court

under Sec. 482 Cr.P.C with the prayer to quash the impugned

Annexure-A2 Final Report/Charge Sheet filed in the impugned

Annexure-A1 Crime No.561/2012 of Valiyamala Police Station

which    has  led   to  the   pendency     of    calendar  case,

C.C.No.63/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Nedumangad and all further proceedings arising

therefrom.

                                ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.R.Arun,

Advocate, has taken notice for respondents 3 & 4 and the

learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for respondents 1 &

2.

      3.   Heard Sri.Latheesh Sebastian, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.R.Arun, learned counsel

appearing for respondents 3 & 4 and the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for respondents 1 & 2.

      4.   The   learned    counsel   for  the   petitioners  has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.R.Arun,    learned     counsel    appearing    for

respondents 3 & 4 has submitted on the basis of the specific

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

instructions furnished by respondents 3 & 4 that respondents 3

& 4 have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and

that they have no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners

as they have no grievance against them and that they will not

raise any dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing

the impugned final report is allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondents

3 & 4, it is clear to the Court that the injured/victim/defacto

complainant         has    no     further   grievance      against   the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived at by

them.

       8.      In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes

                                   ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
      category    of cases,    High  Court   may     quash   criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
      is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
      put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
      criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

             "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".



The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.     Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

                               ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.7254 Of 2014

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-A2 Final Report/Charge Sheet filed in impugned

Annexure-A1 Crime No.561/2012 of Valiyamala Police Station

which has led to the pendency of C.C.No.63/2013 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Nedumangad and all

further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed.       The

petitioners shall produce certified copies of this order before

the Station House Officer concerned as well as before the court

below concerned.

               ============================
                        B.A.No.1253 of 2015
               ============================
                 Dated this the 25th day of March, 2015


                              O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.280 of

2015 of the Tanur Police Station, registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 406 and 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

      3. The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is his

wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, by demanding more

dowry, after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and

money.

      4.  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

B.A.No.1253/2015                 2

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5. The contents of the CD speaks volumes against the

petitioner. It seems that a child is born in the wedlock and the

child is suffering from down syndrome. It is the case of the

defacto complainant that she along with child are not being

maintained by the petitioner and no amount is being paid for

maintenance. When it was made known to the petitioner that

the child is suffering from down syndrome, he has virtually

abandoned the child and the defacto complainant. Whatever

it is, when the case relates to a matrimonial offence, the

possibility   of   settlement    cannot    be    brushed    aside.

Considering the said possibility, this Court is inclined to grant

anticipatory bail to the petitioner, only on that ground.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his executing

a bond for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with

two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of

the officer conducting arrest, and       subject to the following

B.A.No.1253/2015                  3

terms and conditions:-

            (i)   Petitioner   shall    report    before   the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and 11.00

     a.m. on all Wednesdays and Saturdays commencing

     from 01.04.2015 for a period of three months or till the

     filing of the final report in this case, whichever is

     earlier.

            (ii)  Petitioner  shall  not    tamper   with  the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) Petitioner shall make himself available for

     interrogation     as   and    when     required  by   the

     investigating officer.

            (iv) Petitioner shall not involve in any offence

     while on bail.



      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

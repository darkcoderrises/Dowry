                  Crl.M.C.No.3086 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 24th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.

291 of 2013 of Chandera Police Station, Kasaragod district]for

the offences punishable under Sections 415, 418, 468, 405

read with 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-AII

F.I.R in Crime No. 291 of 2013 of Chandera Police Station,

Kasaragod district as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that accused

numbers 1 to 3 who are the petitioners herein with an

intention to grab the property, which is under the ownership of

the de facto complainant and lying in R.S.No.458/1 of

Cheruvathur village, created false document and thereby

committed the offences punishable under Sections 415, 418,

468, 405 r/w Section 34 of IPC.          Now according to the

petitioners the matter is settled between themselves and the

de facto complainant who is the first respondent herein as per

Annexure-AIII agreement.        Annexure-AIV is the affidavit

sworn into by the de facto complainant.

Crl.M.C.No.3086 of 2013         2

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.3086 of 2013           3

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 415, 418, 468, 405

r/w Section 34 of IPC. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the first respondent, it appears to me thatthe de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-




                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:      the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

Crl.M.C.No.3086 of 2013          4

         has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases      power   to  quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend on
         the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having
          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes     of  quashing, particularly the
          offences arising from commercial, financial,
          mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of
          matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
          family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the
          parties have resolved their entire dispute.
          In this category of cases, High Court may
          quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because of the compromise between the
          offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
          continuation of criminal case would put
          accused to great oppression and prejudice
          and extreme injustice would be caused to
          him by not quashing the criminal case
          despite    full and complete settlement and
          compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

Crl.M.C.No.3086 of 2013          5

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - AIII F.I.R in Crime No.291 of 2013 of Chandera

Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

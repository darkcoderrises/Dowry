           ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 17th day of June, 2013

                         O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No.

275/2013 of Pariyaram Medical College Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 408 r/w 34 of I.P.C., with a

prayer to quash Annexure-AII F.I.R Crime No. 275 of 2013 of

Pariyaram Medical College Police Station, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.      The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioners were elected as the committee members of the

Udayapuram Kshethra Shashana Committee on 26/12/2011

and they committed criminal breach of trust by depositing the

amount of the committee, which ought to have deposited in

the account of the committee, in their personal account against

the bye law of the committee and there by committed the

offences punishable under Sections 408 r/w 34 of I.P.C and

now, the case of the petitioners are that the matter is settled

out of court.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
                                2

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
                                   3

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 408 r/w 34 of I.P.C . which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me

that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from

          the above discussion can be summarised

          thus:      the power of the High Court in

          quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

          power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of

Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
                                  4

          the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

          has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases      power   to quash   the    criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes      of quashing,  particularly the

          offences      arising   from     commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
                                  5

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its   view,    because  of   the compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

Crl.M.C.No. 2448 of 2013
                                6

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -AII and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No. 275 of 2013 of Pariyaram Medical

College Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

                     ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
             =========================
                       B.A.No.7401 of 2014
          ============================
           Dated this the 20th day of October, 2014

                              ORDER



            Petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in Crime No.643

of 2014 of Challissery Police Station, Palakkad district registered

for offence under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, has preferred

this application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure. The first petitioner is the son of the second

and third petitioners and the de facto complainant herein is the

wife of first petitioner.

      2.   The prosecution allegation is that the petitioners had

mentally and physically harassed the de facto complainant and

demanded more dowry.

      3. Smt.Mereena J.Joseph, learned counsel for the petitioner,

would submit that the allegations are totally false and that the wife

of the first petitioner is from Kalpeni Island, Lakshadweep and the

entire relationship started with a missed call by the de facto

complainant to the first petitioner and ended up in marriage on

02.11.2011.

B.A No.7401 of 2014               2



     4. The allegations and counter allegations appears to have

been made by the rival parties. Mediation attempts have also

failed and the first petitioner         pronounced Talaq as per

Mohammedan law.          Certain other alleged incidents are also

referred to in the petition.

     5. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that

all the allegations raised against the petitioners are false and

baseless and that the petitioner apprehends arrest in this case

and therefore, anticipatory bail may be granted.

     6. The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the

investigation is almost complete and in case this Court is inclined

to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners, the same may be with

necessary safeguards so as to protect the interest of the

prosecution.

     7.     Having considered the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor and

evaluating the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case,

this Court is inclined to order anticipatory bail to the petitioner,

but, with sufficient safeguards so as to protect the interest of the

prosecution.

B.A No.7401 of 2014                      3



        Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of the arrest of

the petitioners in connection with Crime No.643 of 2014 of

aforementioned crime, and subject to the following conditions:



               i)   The petitioners shall surrender their passport,

                    execution of the bail bond before the
                    Investigating Officer and if either of them are
                    not holders of passport, they shall file an
                    affidavit to that effect in the said court. If the
                    petitioners    requires    their   passport     in
                    connection with their travel abroad, then they
                    shall approach the court concerned for the
                    release of the same and for necessary
                    permission in that regard. In case such an
                    application is filed, the trial court or the
                    jurisdictional Magistrate concerned, as the
                    case may be, is free to consider the same on
                    merits    and   to   pass   appropriate    orders
                    thereon, taking necessary guidance from the
                    principles laid down in the decision of this
                    Court in the case Asok Kumar v State of
                    Kerala, (2009(2) KLT 712), notwithstanding
                    the aforementioned conditions imposed by
                    this Court.

               ii)  The petitioners shall not involve in any
                    criminal offence of similar nature.

               iii) The    petitioners   shall   not  influence    the
                    witnesses or shall not tamper or attempt to
                    tamper evidence in any manner whatsoever.

               iv) The petitioners shall fully co-operate with the
                   investigation   and     report   before     the
                   Investigating Officer as and when required by
                   him.



     If there is any violation of any of the aforementioned

conditions, the bails granted to the petitioners shall stand

cancelled.

                           Crl.M.C. No.1282 of 2013
                           --------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 18th day of August, 2014.

                                        ORDER

             Petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (in short, "Cr.P.C.").

       2.    Petitioners are accused 2 to 7 in C.C.No.369 of 2011 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam. Ottappalam

Police registered Crime No.339 of 2011 under Section 498A of the Indian

Penal Code (in short, "IPC") on the allegation that the 1st accused, who is

the husband of the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant and other accused

persons, who are family members of the 1st accused, meted out cruelty to

her while she was residing in the matrimonial home after their marriage on

15.06.2008. Annexure-II is the final report. Petitioners seek quashment of

the entire proceedings in C.C.No.369 of 2011 of the above said court.

       3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

counsel for the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant.

       4.    The defacto complainant is present in person today. At the

outset, there was a suggestion that the entire dispute existing between the

parties can be settled in a mediation. Learned counsel for the defacto

complainant submitted that the defacto complainant is not prepared to go

Crl.MC No.1282/2013                    2

for a mediation. Therefore, I heard the learned counsel elaborately.

       5.       Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that this is a

case wherein the defacto complainant has roped in all the accused

persons without any valid reason or sufficient pleadings.         Per contra,

learned counsel for the defacto complainant submitted that there are

specific allegations against the petitioners alleging that they also indulged

in physical and mental harassment of the defacto complainant. Learned

Public Prosecutor submitted the case diary for perusal. The complaint

forwarded by the learned Magistrate to Police for investigation shows that

there are allegations against the petitioners as well in regard to the offence

under Section 498A IPC., However, I do not wish to enter into the arena of

facts. Learned counsel for the petitioners relying on Preeti Gupta and

another v. State of Jharkhand and another ((2010) 7 SCC 667)

contended that the allegations in the complaint are exaggerated versions

of small incidents and the complaint was filed with a view to harass the

relatives of her husband. The following observations in the judgment are

strongly relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

                   "32. It is a matter of common experience that

            most of these complaints under section 498-A IPC are

            filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues

            without proper deliberations. We come across a large

Crl.MC No.1282/2013                      3

            number of such complaints which are not even bona

            fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time,

            rapid increase in the number of genuine cases of dowry

            harassment are also a matter of serious concern.

                   33. The learned members of the Bar have

            enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure

            that the social fiber of family life is not ruined or

            demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated

            versions of small incidents should not be reflected in the

            criminal complaints. Majority of the complaints are filed

            either on their advice or with their concurrence. The

            learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble

            profession must maintain its noble traditions and should

            treat every complaint under section 498-A as a basic

            human problem and must make serious endeavour to

            help the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of

            that human problem. They must discharge their duties

            to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber,

            peace and tranquillity of the society remains intact. The

            members of the Bar should also ensure that one

            complaint should not lead to multiple cases.

                   xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

                   35. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the

            truth and punish the guilty and protect the innocent. To

            find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these

            complaints. The tendency of implicating husband and

            all his immediate relations is also not uncommon. At

Crl.MC No.1282/2013                       4

            times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is

            difficult to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be

            extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these

            complaints and must take pragmatic realities into

            consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The

            allegations of harassment of husband's close relations

            who had been living in different cities and never visited

            or rarely visited the place where the complainant

            resided would have an entirely different complexion.

            The allegations of the complaint are required to be

            scrutinized    with   great   care     and  circumspection.

            Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal

            trials lead to rancour, acrimony and bitterness in the

            relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of

            common knowledge that in cases filed by the

            complainant if the husband or the husband's relations

            had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin

            the chances of amicable settlement altogether. The

            process of suffering is extremely long and painful."

       6.       Considering the fact that there are allegations in the complaint,

I am of the view that this Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 482

Cr.P.C. may not be justified in embarking on vexed facts to decide the

issues.      However, the petitioners are free to approach the learned

Magistrate with a petition for discharge and raise all points for claiming a

discharge. It is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that petitioners 2 and

Crl.MC No.1282/2013                       5

3 are aged parents of the 1st accused and some other petitioners are

ladies. It is made clear that the petitioners are free to seek exemption from

personal appearance while claiming a discharge and the learned

Magistrate shall, in the event the petitioners make a request, permit them

to plead discharge in their absence.

                The Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the above observations.

                All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.




                                                A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

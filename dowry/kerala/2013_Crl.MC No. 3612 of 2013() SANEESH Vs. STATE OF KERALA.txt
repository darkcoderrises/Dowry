                Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                  -------------------------------
        Dated this the 27th day of August, 2013.


                          O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in

S.C.No.152/2012 of the Additional Assistant Sessions

Court, Thrissur, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.91/2011 of Pavaratty Police Station]

for the offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 308

r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 final

report and all further proceedings in the above sessions

case, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

20.2.2011 at about 7.30 p.m. when the 2nd respondent

talking with his friend Santhosh in the road on the western

side of the Kanjiramkutty Temple, the petitioners came in a

Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                              2

motor cycle and the 1st petitioner pushed him asking as to

why he was blocking the road and assaulted him using his

hand and the 2nd petitioner beaten him with a stone in his

head and the 3rd petitioner assaulted the 2nd respondent

using his hand and thereafter the 2nd petitioner attempted to

attack the 2nd respondent with stone and he averted the

attack on twisting his head.      If the said attack was not

averted, it would have been danger to his life.          When

persons in the locality assembled and taken the 2nd

respondent to the hospital, the petitioners attacked

respondents 2 to 5 again and in that attack, respondent

nos.3 to 5 sustained injuries.        Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court with the

2nd respondent/de facto complainant and the injured who

sworn into an affidavit dated 26.8.2013.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents.     I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                                3

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who are

the de facto complainant and the injured do not intends to

proceed any further against the petitioners and they have

no grievance against them.

         6.        I  have carefully considered    the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                                    4

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 323, 324,

308 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties

to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.        From the submission made by the

counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant and the injured have no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In

Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                                    5

         what      cases power   to   quash   the  criminal
         proceeding or complaint or         F.I.R. may    be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal    cases   having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,      financial,    mercandile,    civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire dispute.
         In this category of cases, High Court may quash
         criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused
         to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite       full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

Crl.M.C.No.3612 of 2013
                               6

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.           Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A1 final report and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in S.C.No.152/2012 of the

Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Thrissur, [in Crime

No.91/2011 of Pavaratty Police Station].

                                   ORDER


          This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to have the

proceedings in C.C.505 of 2009 on the file of the Judicial

Magistrate of the First Class-II, Kochi quashed and to

drop all further proceedings pursuant thereto against the

petitioners.

          2. Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 in Crime

No.634 of 2009 of Palluruthy Police Station for having

committed offences punishable under Sections 498A,

323, 406, 506(1) and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. The

crime originated on a private complaint, which was

forwarded for investigation under Section 156(3) of the

Cr.P.C.. Allegation is that the petitioners subjected the

defacto complainant to cruelty demanding that more

dowry should be brought by her. After investigation final

Crl.M.C.277/2010.                 2

report was filed, which is marked as Annexure A2. It is

pointed out that the parties have settled the disputes and

there is no further difference of opinions exist between

them. They also filed a petition to that effect before court.

Learned Public Prosecutor submits that his instructions are

to the effect that the matter has been settled.

             3.  Even though some of the offences are not

strictly compoundable, in the light of the fact that the parties

have settled the differences and to give a quietus to the

whole issue, as no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the trial of the case,     in the light of the decisions reported

in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [2008(3) KLT

19(SC)] and Manoj Sharma v. State [2008 (4)KLT 417

(SC)], this petition is allowed, further proceedings in C.C. 505

of 2009 on the file of JFCM-II, Kochi shall stand quashed and

all further proceedings shall stand dropped.




                                              P. BHAVADASAN,
                                                  JUDGE

          ---------------------------------------
                Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 24th day of July, 2013

                             ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No.236/2012 of

Vidyanagar Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 324 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C.,

with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 Final Report and all

proceedings proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.236/2012

of Vidyanagar Police Station, which is now pending as

C.C.No.354/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.  The allegations leveled against the petitioners in

Annexure-A1 final report is that on 16/4/2012 at 7.30 p.m.,

the accused persons, because of their previous enmity towards

the defacto complainant, formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly with deadly weapons such as stick and iron rode and

assaulted the defacto complainant by wrongfully restraining

him, thereby the accused committed the above offences. Now,

the case of the petitioners is that the entire disputes between

Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
                               2

the parties are settled and the defacto complainant who is the

second respondent herein has filed Annexure-4 affidavit dated

1/7/2013 and also filed Crl.M.A.No.5910/2013.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against her.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
                                  3

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 324

r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

               "57.   The position that emerges from the

Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
                                      4

         above discussion can be summarised thus:           the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But     the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
                                   5

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite         full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

Crl.M.C.No. 3065 of 2013
                                6

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in in Crime No.236/2012 of Vidyanagar Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

                     ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
            =========================
                    Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014
          ============================
             Dated this the 20th day of October, 2014

                             ORDER



     The petitioners are the accused in Annexure I FIR in Crime

No.486 of 2011 of Karipur Police Station.          The police after

investigation submitted the impugned Annexure II final report/charge

sheet in the aforementioned Annexure I Crime No.486 of 2011 of

Karipur Police Station, which has led to the institution of      the

Calendar Case C.C No.189 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court - I, Manjeri. The offences alleged are those

under Sections 448, and 354 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

The 2nd respondent is the de facto complainant in the impugned

criminal proceedings.

     2. The gist of the prosecution case is that 20.12.2011 at about

19:45 hours the petitioners had trespassed into the house of the 2nd

respondent and tried to outrage her modesty and that they have

thereby committed the above said offences.         It is stated that

subsequently the differences of opinion between the parties have

been amicably settled and the 2nd respondent is no longer interested

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014            2



to proceed with the impugned criminal proceedings.            The 2nd

respondent has sworn to affidavit dated 03.10.2014, which is

produced as Annexure III in this Crl.M.C, stating the above aspects

wherein it is particularly stated that through mediation the matter

has been settled out of court and that she has no further grievances

against the petitioners and that she is not interested to prosecute as

per the impugned criminal proceedings and that the impugned

criminal proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed by this

Court etc.    It is in the background of these facts and circumstances

that the aforementioned Crl.M.C has been filed with the prayer to

quash the impugned Annexure II final report/charge sheet in the

impugned Annexure I FIR in Crime No.486 of 2011 of Karipur Police

Station, which has led to the institution of C.C No.189 of 2012 on

the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Manjeri and all

further proceedings arising therefrom.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Smt.Liji Kuttappan

has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State of Kerala.

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014             3



      4.    Heard Sri.U.K.Devidas, the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners, Smt.Liji Kuttappan, learned counsel appearing for

2nd respondent, and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for

the 1st respondent-State of Kerala.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that   during    the   pendency   of   the aforementioned     criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties,   which     is resulted  in   the  subject   matter   of   the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money and would unnecessarily strain the financial, administrative

and financial resources of the State.

      6.   Smt.Liji Kuttappan, the learned counsel appearing for the

2nd respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014            4



and that she has no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured does

not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as she has

no grievance against them and that she will not raise any

dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the impugned

final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who also

has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this court

may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law well

settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of the

parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen that

the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and not

much element of public interest is involved. The crucial aspect of

the matter is that though such offences are involved, the real

disputants to the controversy which has led to the impugned

criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an amicable

settlement of the matter. From the submissions made by the

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014                    5



learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, it is clear to the court that

the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

at by them. In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 =

2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as

follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                   "61. The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
          High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
          complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
          distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
          court forInherent
                      compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code.
          statutory limitationpoweritishas to be exercised in accord
                                          of wide plenitude with no
                                  but
          with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
          process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
          criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
          exercised wherewouldoffender andonvictim have settled
                                the
          their
          circumstances of each case and no category canand
                    dispute            depend         the  facts
                                                                   be
          prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
          pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
          for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
          arising from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil,
          partnership or such like transactions or the offences
          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014                 6



          family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
          quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
          compromise between the offender and victim, the
          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
          continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
          oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
          be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case
          despite full and complete settlement and compromise
          with the victim........"

      In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8) Scale 634

= III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC), the Apex Court

has held as follows:

             "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
      entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
      peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
      proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace
      and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
      them".

       The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, it

is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have arisen

consequent to the personal disputes between the disputants and

the disputes have been settled amicably between the parties.

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014            7



Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,

the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions of the

Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned criminal

proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount to

abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger sense.

Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra, this Court

is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by granting the

prayers sought for.

Crl.M.C No.5657 of 2014               8



          In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure II final report/charge sheet in the impugned Annexire I

FIR in Crime No.486 of 2011 of Karipur Police Station which has led

to the pendency of the Calendar Case C.C No.189 of 2012 on the

file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Manjeri and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners shall

produce certified copies of this order before the court below

concerned as well as before the Station House Officer, Karipur Police

Station.

                        Dated this the 2nd day of January, 2007


                                       J U D G M E N T




        Petitioner's   daughter,   who   was   married   to   one   Ajith   Kumar,   died   at


Sarsawa,   Sharanpur.     Obviously  the   case  is   one   of   suicide.     The   petitioner


alleges  that   this   is  a  dowry death.     He  cites  the  undue  haste  shown  by  the


husband in cremating the dead body of petitioner's daughter as a reason for


his   suspicion.     The   petitioner   submits   that   since   the   marriage   between   his


daughter   and   Ajith   Kumar   was   only   5   years   old,   the   case   was   one   for   an


investigation for unnatural death.   The petitioner, therefore, seeks a direction


to the 2nd  respondent to conduct an investigation into the unnatural death of


the daughter of the petitioner.  However, for the present, the petitioner would


be satisfied with a direction to the 1st  respondent to consider and dispose of


Exts.P2 and P3, as expeditiously as possible.


        2.       I have heard  the   learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner as  also  the


learned Assistant Solicitor General.


        In the facts and circumstances of the case, there would be a direction


to the 1st respondent to consider and pass appropriate orders on Exts.P2 and


P3,   as   expeditiously   as   possible,   at   any   rate,   within   three   months   from   the


date   of   receipt   of   a   copy   of   this   judgment.     The   petitioner   shall   forward   a


certified copy of the judgment along with copies of Exts.P2 and P3 to the 1st


respondent for due compliance.





                                                                    (S. SIRI JAGAN, JUDGE)

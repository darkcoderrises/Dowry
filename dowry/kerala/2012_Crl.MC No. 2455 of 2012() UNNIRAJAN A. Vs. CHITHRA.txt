                Crl.M.C. NO. 2455 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 17th day of December, 2012

                              ORDER


            Petitioners are the accused in a pending case on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Hosdurg. The

aforesaid case arose on a crime registered on the complaint of

first respondent, who is the wife of the first accused. Other

accused are the close relatives of the first accused and they have

been prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section

498(A) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, alleging of

matrimonial cruelty and harassment of the first respondent, wife

of first accused, demanding dowry. By order dated 05.10.2012

taking into consideration the submissions made by counsel on

both sides that the spouses have settled the disputes the

magistrate was directed to conduct an enquiry over the

settlement effected, provided a joint application is moved by the

parties for that purpose. Report received from the magistrate

indicate that application was moved jointly by the fourth

Crl.M.C. NO. 2455 of 2012         2


accused and de facto complainant and in the enquiry conducted

he was satisfied that the spouses have resolved all matrimonial

disputes. Sworn statement recorded from the de facto

complainant disclosed that her marital tie with the first accused

had been severed a year back by a decree granted by a

competent Family Court. She has no further grievance against

the accused and she is not interested in prosecuting them, is the

submission of the counsel appearing for her.             In such

circumstances, I find settlement effected by the parties can be

accepted taking note that matrimonial disputes between the

spouses, first accused and first respondent, have given rise to

the aforesaid criminal case against petitioners/accused. In Gian

Singh V. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)]        the Apex

Court has held that in crime cases registered over matrimonial

disputes even if the offences imputed are non bailable,

settlement effected by parties can be taken into account for

exercising inherent powers of this court to terminate the

criminal proceedings. Further more, in view of the settlement

effected even if the prosecution is continued against petitioners

Crl.M.C. NO. 2455 of 2012           3


it may not serve any purpose. In the circumstance, criminal

proceedings against petitioners/accused in C.C. No.1115 of

2011 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Hosdurg, are

quashed exercising the inherent powers of this court, under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

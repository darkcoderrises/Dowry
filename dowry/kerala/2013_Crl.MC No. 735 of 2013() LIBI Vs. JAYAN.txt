                   Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 04th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused No.3 in S.C.No.567 of 2011 on

the file of the Assistant Sessions Court, Attingal        which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.427 of 2010

of Kadakkavoor Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 341, 324 & 308 read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-A2 Final Report and all

further proceedings in S.C.No.567 of 2011 on the file of the

Assistant Sessions Court, Attingal as the matter is settled out

of court.

     2.    The prosecution case is that, on 09/07/2010 at

3.15 p.m. the accused with an intention to cause injury on the

de facto complainant, the 1st respondent herein, the first

accused with a knife stabbed on the back of the chest and

when the 1st accused tried to stab on chest, the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                             :-2-:


complainant evaded the same with his left hand, which

resulted in injury.   Then the other accused with their hands

and legs hit on the stomach and all over the body. Now the

case of the petitioner is that the dispute between the

petitioner, who is the 3rd accused and the de facto

complainant, is settled out of court.

     3.   The learned counsel for the petitioner on the basis of

Annexure-A3 submitted that the petitioner has been selected

for the post of Constables (GD) in CPO, Rifleman (GD) in

Assam Rifles and accordingly the matter is settled between the

petitioner and the de facto complainant. The learned counsel

appearing for the de facto complainant also submitted that the

de facto complainant has also no objection in dropping the

proceedings against the petitioner. On the other hand, the

learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the offences involved

are including 308 of IPC and therefore the dropping of

proceedings against the petitioner is likely to affect the

prosecution against the remaining accused.

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                             :-3-:


     4.   I have carefully considered the submissions.     On

going by Annexure-II charge, it appears that the overt act

alleged against the petitioner is only hit with hand on the de

facto complainant. As per the allegation he has not used any

deadly weapon against the de facto complainant and the de

facto complainant has no grievance or objection in dropping

the proceedings against the petitioner, who is the 3rd accused

in the above petition. Annexure-A4 is the affidavit sworn into

by the de facto complainant.

     5.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of

the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings

in the above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

     7. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on the

basis of specific instruction received    from the respondent

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                             :-4-:


submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance against

him.

     8. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

     9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the

above case are only under Sections 341, 324 & 308 read with

Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


1st respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the victim/the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                                   :-6-:


        arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

        partnership or such like transactions or the offences

        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

Crl.M.C.No.735 of 2013
                              :-7-:


resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner/3rd accused in S.C.No.567 of 2011 on the

file of the Assistant Sessions Court, Attingal.

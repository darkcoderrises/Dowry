                    B.A.No.5315 of 2015
         -------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 7th day of September, 2015

                         O R D E R

     Application filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2.   Petitioners are accused 1 to 4 in Crime No.2623

of 2015 of Perumbavoor Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 354 and 406

r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.   Prosecution case is that the first accused

married the de facto complainant on 20.11.2014. After

taking her ornaments, the petitioners started harassing

the de facto    complainant demanding more dowry. The

petitioners plead innocent.

     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

and learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   Considering the nature of allegations, I find that

custodial interrogation may not be necessary in this case.

Hence, I am inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the

petitioners with the following conditions:

     (a)  Petitioners      shall     surrender      before  the

B.A.No.5315 of 2015
                              2

Investigating Officer within a period of 'two weeks' from

today    and     submit   themselves     for  interrogation.

Thereafter, the petitioners shall be released on bail on

executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five

Thousand Only) each with two solvent sureties each for

the like sum     to the satisfaction of the    Investigating

Officer.

     (b)   The    petitioners shall   appear    before   the

Investigating Officer as and when required for the purpose

of interrogation.

     (c)   The   petitioners  shall  co-operate   with   the

investigation of the case.

     (d)   The petitioners shall not intimidate or influence

the witnesses or meddle with the investigation in any

manner.

     (e)   Petitioners shall not, during the period of this

bail get involved in any offence.

     In case any of the above conditions is violated, bail

granted hereby is liable to be cancelled for which the

B.A.No.5315 of 2015
                            3

investigating officer may move application before the

jurisdictional magistrate.

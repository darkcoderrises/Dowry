                    Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014
                  ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of October, 2014.

                             O R D E R

     The eight petitioners herein are the accused in Crime

No.156/2011 of Vidyanagar Police Station, Kasaragod District.

The police after investigation has submitted impugned

Annexure-A1 Final Report/Charge Sheet in impugned Crime

No.156/2011 of Vidyanagar Police Station, Kasaragod District,

which has led to the institution of C.C.No.462/2011 on the file

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod. The offences

alleged are those under Secs.143, 147, 148, 448, 341, 323

r/w 149 IPC. The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on

17.3.2011 at about 21:15 hours, the petitioners unlawfully

assembled with deadly weapons and trespassed into the house

of the defacto complainant and assaulted her etc. It is stated

that now the entire disputes between the petitioners/accused

and the defacto complainant have been settled amicably. The

defacto complainant (1st respondent) has filed an affidavit

dated 5.5.2014, which has been produced in this Crl.M.C

stating the above aspects wherein it is specifically stated that

she is not interested to continue the impugned criminal

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

proceedings and that she has no objection in the quashment of

the impugned Annexure-A1 Final Report/Charge Sheet in the

impugned Crime No.156/2011 of Vidyanagar Police Station,

Kasaragod District, which has led to the institution of

C.C.No.462/2011 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod etc. It is in the background of these facts

and circumstances, the instant Crl.M.C has been filed seeking

the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-A1 Final

Report/Charge Sheet in the impugned Crime No.156/2011 of

Vidhyanagar Police Station, which has led to the institution of

C.C.No.462/2011 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court,   Kasaragod     and   all   further  proceedings    arising

therefrom.

      2.    The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.Siju Mathew,

Advocate, has taken notice for the 1st respondent and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 2nd respondent-State of

Kerala.

      3.    Heard Sri.T.B.Shajimon, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners, Sri.Siju Mathew, learned counsel appearing for

the 1st respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing

for the 2nd respondent.

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

      4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both parties as the

real disputants to the controversy have arrived at an amicable

settlement and any further continuation of the criminal

proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and money

and would unnecessarily strain the judicial, administrative and

financial resources of the State.

      5.    Sri.Siju Mathew, learned counsel appearing for the 1st

respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific instructions

furnished by the 1st respondent that the 1st respondent has

amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and that she

has no objection in the quashment of the impugned criminal

proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as she has

no grievance against them and that they will not raise any

dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

                                 ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

      6.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case in

the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature.

The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such offences are

involved, the real disputants to the controversy, which has led to

the impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, it is clear to the

Court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at by them.

      8.    In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court

has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

            "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may     quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
       public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
       such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
       about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
       hesitate to quash them".

                                    ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.     This Court vide order dated 17.10.2014 in this

Crl.M.C had passed the following order:

            "The Station House Officer of the Vidyanagar Police
      Station, Kasaragode shall file a statement as to whether there
      has been any complaints against the petitioners from the 1st
      respondent, after the occurrence of the incident which is said
      to have happened on 17.3.2011, mentioned in Annexure-A1
      Final Report and whether the petitioners are creating any
      problems for the peaceful life of the 1st respondent."

In obedience to the direction as per order dated 17.10.2014

passed by this Court, the investigating officer in the above said

Crime No.156/2011 of Vidyanagar Police Station has filed a

statement dated 23.10.2014.               Paragraphs 3 & 4 of the

statement reads as follows:

             "3.   It is submitted that accused Nos.1, 2, 3, 5 and 8
      were also the accused in Cr.No.155/2011 under Secs.143,
      147, 148, 153, 447, 427 r/w 149 and A1, 2, 4, 8 were accused
      in Crime No.157/2011 under Secs.143, 147, 148, 341, 324
      r/w 149 IPC of Vidyanagar Police Station.       Both the cases
      were political and all the accused in Crime No.155/2011 were
      acquitted under Sec.248(1) Cr.P.C on 27.8.2013. In Crime
      No.157/2011, A1, A4 and A8 were acquitted under Sec.248(1)
      Cr.P.C on 18.1.2014. The case against A2 was split up as
      C.C.No.8/2014.
             4.    It is humbly submitted that no petition or
      complaint has been received to this office against the
      petitioners from the 1st respondent after the occurrence of the
      incident dated 17.3.2011 and petitioners are not creating any
      problems to the peaceful life of the 1st respondent."

                                ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

                                ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.2548 Of 2014

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by

granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annnexure-A1 Final Report/Charge Sheet in impugned Crime

No.156/2011 of Vidyanagar Police Station, Kasaragod District,

which has led to the institution of C.C.No.462/2011 on the file

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod and all

further proceedings arising therefrom against all the accused

stand quashed. The petitioners shall forward certified copies of

this order to the Station House Officer concerned as well as to

the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned.




                                            ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                    Judge.

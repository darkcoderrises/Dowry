              ------------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 7 in S.C.No.446 of

2011 on the file of the Assistant Sessions Court, Thalassery

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.600 of 2009 of Thalassery Police Station for the offence

punishable under Section 364-A of IPC with a prayer to quash

Annexure-2 Final Report and all further proceedings in

S.C.No.446 of 2011 on the file of the Assistant Sessions Judge,

Thalassery as the matter is settled out of court.

    2.    The allegation in the above case is that one

Minu Joseph, native of Thrissur wanted to secure admission

for the MBBS Course at Lakshmi Narayana College,

Pondicheri and she approached petitioners 1 and 2 who were

running a consultancy firm by name "Guidant Marketing India

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                            :-2-:


Pvt. Ltd" at Thrissur. The petitioners 1 and 2 in turn was

assured by the 2nd respondent, who was working at Chennai

that he would secure admission for Minu Joseph. According to

the allegation, as demanded by the 2nd respondent a sum of

`3,00,000/- and a D.D. for a sum of `1,00,000/- drawn in the

name of the Institution entrusted with the 2nd respondent. But

the 2nd respondent could not secure the admission on the

ground that the College Authorities were demanding a larger

package. Further allegation is that, petitioners 1 and 2 on the

belief that the 2nd respondent was responsible for causing loss

to their concern went to Chennai and detained the 2nd

respondent in a hotel room and they had harassed the 2nd

respondent demanding the money and thereby committed the

offence punishable under Section 364-A of IPC.       The first

respondent is the de facto complainant and the 2nd respondent

is the alleged victim. Now, the case of the petitioners is that

the matter has been settled out of court and accordingly

respondents 1 and 2 have filed separate affidavits.

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                              :-3-:




     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as respondents 1 and 2. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5. The learned counsel for respondents 1 and 2 who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents 1 and 2, who are the de

facto complainant and the victim do not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

     6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                              :-4-:


materials produced along with the above petition including

affidavits. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the

above case are only under Section 364-A of IPC which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for respondents 1 and 2, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant and the victim have no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                                  :-6-:


        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"



        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2488 of 2013
                             :-7-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-2 Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.446 of 2011 on the file of the

court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Thalassery.

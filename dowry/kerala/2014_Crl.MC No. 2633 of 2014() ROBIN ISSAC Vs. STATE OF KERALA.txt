                      Crl.M.C.No. 2633 of 2014
                    ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 23rd day of May, 2014

                                 O R D E R


      This Crl.M.C. is filed by the sole accused in Crime No. 96 of

2014 of Vythiri Police Station, to quash the proceedings, on the

basis of settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the sole

accused in Crime No.96 of 2014 of Vythiri Police Station,

registered on the basis of the statement given by the defacto

complainant, who is the 2nd respondent herein, alleging

commission of offences under Sections 324 and 341 of the Indian

Penal Code. The 2nd respondent is the Vice Principal of Oriental

School of Hotel Management at Lakkidi in Wayanad District. The

petitioner and respondents 3 and 4 are the students of the

institution and there was some dispute regarding the conduct of

the institution and some incident happened on 07.03.2014.

Respondents 2 to 4 sustained injuries in that incident. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. The relationship

between the parties have been restored. The matter has been

settled due to the intervention of Mediators and well wishers of

Crl.M.C.No. 2633 of 2014              2

both parties. Defacto complainant and the injured do not want to

proceed with the prosecution any more.                Since some of the

offences are none compoundable in nature and also it is in the

crime stage, neither the police nor the court will entertain the

compounding. So he has no other remedy except to approach

this Court seeking the following relief:

           "Hence it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court

      may be pleaded to quash Annexure-I First Information

      Report as against the petitioner in Crime No.96 of 2014 of

      Vythiri Police Station, in the interest of justice."

      3.   Respondents 2 to 4 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties.

The relationship between the parties have been restored as

before and they do not want to prosecute the petitioner. They

have filed Annexures II to IV affidavits stating these facts. The

counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction even if ultimately

Final Report is filed.

      4.   The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner and he has no criminal background, but

opposed the application.

Crl.M.C.No. 2633 of 2014          3

      5. Heard both sides.

      6. It is an admitted fact that the 2nd respondent is the Vice

Principal of Oriental School of Hotel Management at Lakkidi in

Wayanad District. The petitioner and respondents 3 and 4 are

students of that institution. It is also an admitted fact that on

07.03.2014, on account of some dispute in the institution, some

incidents happened in which respondents 2 to 4 sustained some

injuries.   On the basis of the statement given by the 2nd

respondent as Vice Principal of the institution, Annexure I, First

Information Report was registered as Crime No.96 of 2014 of

Vythiri Police Station against the petitioner alleging offences

under Sections 324 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties.            The cordial

relationship between the students have been restored as before

on account of the settlement which was arrived at, due to the

intervention of well wishers of both parties. Respondents 2 to 4

have filed Annexures II to IV affidavits stating that the matter has

been settled and they have no grievances against the petitioner

and that they do not want to prosecute the case further. In view

of the settlement, there is no possibility of any co-operation from

the respondents in the matter of investigation in the case and

Crl.M.C.No. 2633 of 2014            4

even if ultimately Final Report is filed and the case is allowed to

be prosecuted, conviction in such cases will be remote. Further it

is not a matter of public interest. But, it is a private dispute arose

between the parties in respect of the Management of the

institution and that has been settled amicably between the

parties.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

held that:

      "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
      cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
      and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of the
      criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process
      of law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
      justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
      and if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
      the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash

Crl.M.C.No. 2633 of 2014           5

        the criminal proceeding."

        8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled due to

the intervention of Mediators and well wishers, the relationship

between the parties have been restored as before and possibility

of conviction will be remote in such circumstances, this Court

feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings. In order to promote the relationship that has been

restored on account of the settlement and also to promote the

smooth functioning of the institution as well. So, this Crl.M.C. is

allowed and further proceedings in Crime No.96 of 2014 of the

Vythiri Police Station in Wayanad District as against the petitioner

is hereby quashed. The office is directed to communicate this

order to the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kalpetta so as to

inform the Vythiri Police Station for necessary further action in this

regard immediately.

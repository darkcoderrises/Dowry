            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. No. 2753 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of July, 2013

                            ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No. 3751/2010 of

Central Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 323, 324, 308 and Section 34 of I.P.C., with a prayer

to quash the proceedings in S.C.No.193/2012 Sessions Court,

Ernakulam, as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation against the petitioners accused are

that they attacked the respondents 2 to 5 during the arts

festival of Law College on 14/12/2010 and thereby committed

the offence punishable under Sections 323, 324, 308 and

Section 34 of I.P.C. Now, the case of the petitioners as well as

respondents 2 to 5 are that some of them are completed their

course and they are practicing lawyers and accordingly the

matter is settled. The respondents 2 to 5 are sworn into

Annexure 2 to 5 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C. No. 2753 of 2013
                                2

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 5 who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

injured does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and they has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 323, 324, 308 and Section

Crl.M.C. No. 2753 of 2013
                                     3

34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.      From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents, it appears to me that the injured has no further

grievance against the petitioners accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

Crl.M.C. No. 2753 of 2013
                                      4

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........   But   the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

Crl.M.C. No. 2753 of 2013
                                5

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime

No. 3751/2010 of Central Police Station and all further

proceedings thereto.

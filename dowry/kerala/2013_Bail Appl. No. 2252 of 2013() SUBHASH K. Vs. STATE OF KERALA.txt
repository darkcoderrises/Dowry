                        B.A No.2252 of 2013
           -------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 8th day of April, 2013


                                 ORDER



      Petitioners are the accused (A1 to A3) in Crime No.310 of

2013 of Puthoor Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A, 323 and 324 r/w Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.        The above crime was registered on a

complaint filed by the wife of first petitioner alleging matrimonial

cruelty and harassment, both physically and mentally, demanding

dowry by petitioners. De facto complainant is the wife of first

petitioner, second petitioner, father of first petitioner, and, third

petitioner, his brother. Crime is now under investigation. Learned

counsel for petitioner submits that the crime has been registered

on false allegations and they are innocent.                Petitioners are

prepared to co-operate with investigation of the crime, is the

submission of counsel.        Learned Public Prosecutor has made

B.A No.2252/2013                  2




available the case diary for my perusal.           She was brutally

assaulted by petitioners and she sustained injuries and underwent

treatment, is the case of de facto complainant among other

allegations to impute the offences in the crime against

petitioners.    Going through the materials gathered by the

investigating agency, it is seen, complaint was filed before the

magistrate after considerable lapse of time with a case that

though information was given, police did not register the

complaint in time. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

presented, I find, arrest and custodial interrogation of petitioners

is not required for a fair investigation of the crime. However,

petitioners have to co-operate with the investigation.



          1)    Petitioners are directed to be enlarged on
                bail in the event of their arrest, on execution
                of a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten
                Thousand Only) each, with one solvent
                surety for the like sum, by the investigating
                officer in the above crime.


          2)    Petitioners    shall   report     before   the
                Investigating Officer at the station once in a
                week on every Monday at a time between
                10:00 a.m and 12:00 noon from 16.04.2013

B.A No.2252/2013                  3




                onwards irrespective of whether they are
                arrested or not in the crime.    They shall
                continue to appear before the investigating
                officer, as directed, for a period of four
                weeks or till completion of investigation of
                the crime, whichever is earlier.

          3)    Petitioners are also directed to co-operate
                with the investigation.


          Petition is allowed.

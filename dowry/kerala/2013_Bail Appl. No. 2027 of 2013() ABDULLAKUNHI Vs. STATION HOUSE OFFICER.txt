                                ORDER


      Petitioners are two among the accused (A2 and A3) in Crime

No.177 of 2013 of Kasargod Police Station, registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A r/w. Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.        The above crime was registered on a

complaint from the wife of first accused, son of the above

petitioners, who is stated to be employed in a gulf country.

Alleging matrimonial cruelty by the husband and in-laws, the de

facto complainant got the above crime registered, and it is now

under investigation. All the accused inflicted cruelty against the

de facto complainant demanding dowry, is the gist of the

accusation apart from alleging that they have misappropriated the

sum and her ornaments collected earlier as dowry.

      2. First accused and the de facto complainant, the spouses,

both of them, got married after failure of their previous marriage,

is the submission of counsel. Parents of the first accused have

been implicated in the crime as co-accused only to vex and harass

them, is the further submission.

learned   Public    Prosecutor,  I  find    arrest  and   custodial

interrogation of petitioner as such may not be required for a fair

investigation of the crime.     In case of arrest of any of the

petitioners in the crime by police, it is ordered that he or she

shall be released on executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees

Ten thousand only) with one solvent surety for the like sum.

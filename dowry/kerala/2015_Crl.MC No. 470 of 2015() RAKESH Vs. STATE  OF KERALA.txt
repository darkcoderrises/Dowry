                     Crl.M.C No. 470 of 2015
           ..............................................................
          Dated this the 6th day of March, 2015.


                             O R D E R

     Petitioners are A1 to A4 in Crime No.1012/2012 of the

Payyannur Police Station, Kannur registered for the offence

punishable under Sections 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I FIR and A2 Final

report in Crime No No.1012/12 of the Payyannur Police

Station, Kannur and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C..No.918/20113 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Payyannur, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more

dowry .

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

Crl.M.C No. 470 of 2015         2

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.   The     defacto complainant,   who     is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaint against

the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the

matter referred to above can be quashed. She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit

has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own

volition.

      7.   When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

Crl.M.C No. 470 of 2015           3

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

     In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed and Annexure-I FIR

and A2 Final report in Crime No No.1012/12 of the Payyannur

Police Station, Kannur and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C..No.918/20113 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Payyannur are hereby quashed.

                        B.A. No.9178 of 2014
                    --------------------------------------
            Dated this the 30th day of December, 2014

                               O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioner is the 2nd accused in Crime No.1806 of

2014 of the Anchal Police Station, registered for the offences

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 IPC.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

along with the other accused have tortured and harassed the

defacto complainant, who is the wife of the 1st accused and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry and gold

ornaments, after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments

and money.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Senior Public Prosecutor.

      5.    The investigation of this case is practically over.

No criminal antecedents have been reported against the

petitioner. This is not a case, wherein the custodial

interrogation of the petitioner is required for the continued

B.A. No.9178 of 2014         2

investigation of this case. Being a matrimonial offence and

considering the chance of re-union and the possibility of

settlement in the matter, I am of the view that this is a fit case

wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his executing

a bond for .50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two

solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the

officer conducting arrest, and subject to the following terms

and conditions:-

           (i)   The petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00 a.m. on all Saturdays commencing from

     03.01.2015 for a period of three months or till the

     filing of the final report in this case, whichever is

     earlier.

           (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the

B.A. No.9178 of 2014         3

     evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The  petitioner   shall    make    himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

              Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015
     ------------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of May, 2015

                           ORDER


     The petitioner is the de facto complainant in

Crime No.421 of 2013 of the Medical College Police

Station,   Thiruvananthapuram,         registered      for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 34 of the

Indian Penal Code and Sec.4 of the Dowry Prohibition

Act.   The   police    charge     sheeted      the    case  as

C.C.No.1105 of 2013 on the files of the Additional Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Thiruvananthapuram. The

3rd respondent is the husband of the petitioner and the

4th and 5th respondents are the in-laws.

     2.   In this petition it is stated that now the

petitioner and the respondents 3 to 5 have settled the

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015       -: 2 :-

entire family disputes and now they are living

together.    The    petitioner  has    realised  that   the

prosecution was lodged on mistake of fact and

misunderstanding.       The petitioner does not intend to

proceed with the prosecution.         The offences involved

in this case are purely personal and do not affect the

public peace and tranquility.         Hence the petitioner

prayed for quashing         the entire     proceedings in

C.C.No.1105 of 2013.        The learned counsel for the

petitioner drew my attention to the decision reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108

(SC)].

      3. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench

of the Apex Court, on a reference, considered the

question whether the High Court has power to quash

criminal    proceedings    involving non-compoundable

offences on the basis of the compromise reached

between the offender and the victim and answered as

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015         -: 3 :-

given below:

            "57. The position that emerges from

            the   above      discussion     can   be

            summarised thus: the power of the

            High Court in quashing a criminal

            proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

            exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

            distinct and different from the power

            given    to  a    criminal    court   for

            compounding      the   offences    under

            S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

            of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in

            accord with the guideline engrafted in

            such power viz;(1) to secure the ends

            of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

            the process of any Court.        In what

            cases power to quash the criminal

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may

            be exercised where the offender and

            victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and

            circumstances of each case and no

            category     can      be      prescribed.

            However, before exercise of such

            power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of

            the crime.      Heinous and serious

            offences   of   mental      depravity or

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015          -: 4 :-

            offences like murder, rape, dacoity,

            etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

            though the victim or victim's family

            and the offender have settled the

            dispute. Such offences are not private

            in nature and have serious impact on

            society.    Similarly, any compromise

            between the victim and offender in

            relation to the offences under special

            statutes like Prevention of Corruption

            Act or the offences committed by

            public servants while working in that

            capacity etc; cannot provide for any

            basis      for     quashing     criminal

            proceedings involving such offences.

            But     the   criminal    cases  having

            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

            civil flavour stand on different footing

            for    the   purposes       of quashing,

            particularly the offences arising from

            commercial,      financial,   mercantile,

            civil,   partnership     or   such  like

            transactions or the offences arising

            out of matrimony relating to dowry,

            etc., or the family disputes where the

            wrong is basically private or personal

            in nature and the parties have

            resolved their entire dispute. In this

            category of cases, High Court may

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015          -: 5 :-

            quash criminal proceedings if in its

            view, because of the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and

            bleak and continuation of criminal

            case would put accused to great

            oppression     and      prejudice   and

            extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal

            case    despite   full   and   complete

            settlement and compromise with the

            victim. In other words, the High Court

            must consider whether it would be

            unfair or contrary to the interest of

            justice to continue with the criminal

            proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal        proceeding         would

            tantamount to abuse of process of

            law     despite     settlement      and

            compromise between the victim and

            wrongdoer and whether to secure the

            ends of justice, it is appropriate that

            criminal case is put to an end and if

            the answer to the above question(s)

            is in affirmative, the High Court shall

            be well within its jurisdiction to quash

            the criminal proceeding."

      4. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015    -: 6 :-

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the

offences alleged against the respondents 3 to 5 will

not come under the category of non-compoundable

offences,    which    are specifically excluded  from

composition, in the exercise of inherent power under

Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the petition filed by

the de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute

between the accused and the victim had been

amicably settled and, at present, the de facto

complainant has no subsisting grievance at all. The

de facto complainant does not want to proceed with

prosecution against the accused.       In view of the

compromise between the respondents 3 to 5 and the

victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is

remote, bleak and continuation of the criminal case

would, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice

Crl.M.C. No.2877 of 2015       -: 7 :-

and also tantamount to abuse of the process of the

court. The present criminal prosecution against the

accused must be put to an end to secure the interest

of justice.

      5. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against respondents 3 to 5 under Annexure-A1 Final

Report are quashed in exercise of jurisdiction and

power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

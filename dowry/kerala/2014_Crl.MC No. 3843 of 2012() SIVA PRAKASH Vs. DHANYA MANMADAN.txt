                    Crl.M.C. No.3843 of 2012
          ----------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 17th day of March, 2014

                              ORDER

      This petition is filed u/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash Annexure-

A1 F.I.R. in Crime No.1173/2010 of Pathanamthitta Police

Station, which is pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Pathanamthitta for the offence punishable

u/s.498A r/w. 34 IPC, by invoking the inherent jurisdiction.

The petitioners are accused in the above case, which was

filed by Smt. Dhanya Manmadan, who is the 1st respondent

in this petition. The petitioners contended that they had

settled the dispute amicably with intervention of respectable

mediators of both parties and there is nothing survive. Both

parties were remarried and leading a comfortable married life

and no dispute among them.        The learned counsel for the

petitioners relied Apex Court decision in B.S. Joshy v. State of

Crl.M.C.No.3843/12             2

Haryana and another [2003 (4) SCC 675].             The 1st

respondent also has no objection and therefore, the trial of

the above case is mere abuse of process of Court.

      2.    The allegation of the 1st respondent in the trial

court was that the 1st petitioner married the defacto

complainant       (1st respondent)  on   3.2.2003   as  per

customary rites, thereafter, both parties resided together

as husband and wife in the matrimonial house.          While

residing together, the petitioners illtreated her both

physically and mentally demanding more amount as

dowry. On 11.7.2009, the 1st petitioner went abroad and

obtained a job and after that also, there was ill-treatment.

In the circumstances, she filed the above complaint before

Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Pathanamthitta which was

forwarded to Pathanamthitta police and after getting that

complaint,      Pathanamthitta  Police   registered   Crime

1173/10. Hence the petition.

      3.    The    inherent powers    of  the  High    Court

Crl.M.C.No.3843/12                  3

contemplated u/s 482 Cr.P.C. has to be exercised only for

the three purposes mentioned in the Section. This power

cannot be invoked naturally in a matter where it is covered

by a specific provision of the code. Therefore it means

that if the matter in question is not covered by any

provision of the code, it comes into operation, for the three

purposes mentioned in the section i.e.,to make such

orders necessary to "give effect to any order" under this

code or to prevent "abuse of the process" of any court or

to secure "the ends of justice".                 Apex Court in

Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551]

                The following principles in relation to the
         exercise of the inherent power of the High Court
         have been followed ordinarily and generally,
         almost invariably, barring a few exceptions:
          (1) That the power is not to be resorted to if there
          is a specific provision in the Code for the redress
          of the grievance of the aggrieved party.(2) That it
          should be exercised very sparingly to prevent
          abuse of process of any court or otherwise to
          secure the ends of justice. (3) That it should not
          be exercised as against the express bar of law
          engrafted n any other provision of the Code.

      4.    The facts and circumstances in this case show

that the complaint was filed by the 1st respondent with

Crl.M.C.No.3843/12               4

regard to matrimonial cruelty.         Now the petitioners

contended that both parties obtained a divorce by

Annexure-A3 order on mutual consent. As per Annexure-

A3, the marriage between the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent dissolved and decree was granted on

21.12.2011. Even though the petitioners contended that

they have settled the matter, no copy of compromise

petition has been produced along with this petition. In the

absence of such petition, I am of the view that this is not a

fit case to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and it dismissed

accordingly.

      However, before parting with this order, I clarify that

the parties are at liberty to file compromise petition before

the trial Court and if any compromise petition is filed by

them,    the     learned Magistrate    shall  consider   that

application and dispose the case in accordance with law.

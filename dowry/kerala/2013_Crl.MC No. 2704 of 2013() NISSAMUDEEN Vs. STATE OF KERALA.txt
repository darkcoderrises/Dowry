                  Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 03rd day of July, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 5 in C.C.No.833 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Karunagappally which is a case instituted upon the police

report in Crime No.30 of 2012 of Oachira Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 323, 498-A & 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-1 F.I.R and Annexure-2 Final

Report in Crime No.30 of 2012 of Oachira Police Station and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.833 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Karunagappally as the matter is settled out

of court.

     2.   The prosecution case is that the first accused

married   the   de    facto    complainant       on   11/03/2010 at

V.M.Auditorium, Manappilly in Karunagappally and thereafter

they resided in the matrimonial home. After one month of the

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                              :-2-:


marriage, the first accused left for Gulf for joining his

employment and for which the accused sold 15 sovereigns of

gold and after the birth of a child, the accused started to

harass the de facto complainant, demanding more dowry and

all the accused together mentally harassed the de facto

complainant and thereby the accused committed the offence

punishable under Sections 323, 498-A & 34 of IPC. Now the

case of the petitioners is that an amicable settlement is arrived

at between the accused and the de facto complainant, who is

the second respondent and respondents 3 and 4 and decided to

dissolve the marriage by mutual consent and accordingly the

marriage was dissolved. Annexure-3 is the affidavit of the de

facto   complainant    and    Annexures-4    and   5   affidavits

respectively were sworn in by respondents 3 and 4.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents 2, 3 and 4. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

        4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                             :-3-:


settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case.    Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the second

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the de

facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and they have no grievance against

them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-3, 4 & 5 affidavits.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                                   :-4-:


        7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 323, 498-A & 34 of

IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.   From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in

the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decisions of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)]   and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                                         :-5-:


           compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

           ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

           any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

           the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

           no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

           for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

           arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

           partnership or such like transactions or the offences

           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

           quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

           compromise between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

           continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

           oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

           caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

           full and complete settlement and compromise with the

           victim........"


Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court

has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                                   :-6-:


              "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes

        have been on considerable increase in recent times

        resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A and

        406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also against

        the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

        matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin

        the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

        pending disputes for which both the sides approached the

        High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal

        proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

        Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can

        be declined on the sole ground that since the offences are

        non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

        would be impermissible for the court to quash the

        criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

              8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand

        subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under

        Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the

        Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

        intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers,

        the parties concerned have amicably settled their

        differences   and   executed    a  compromise/settlement.

        Pursuant    thereto,    the  appellants    filed   the  said

        compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place

        the same on record and to drop the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants herein. It is also not in dispute that

        in additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the

        parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating

        that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants and fully supported the contents of

        the settlement deed. It is the grievance of the appellants

        that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the

        parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                                   :-7-:


        jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the

        ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the

        offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC

        which are non-compoundable in nature."

               "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to

        encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,

        particularly, when the same are on considerable increase.

        Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if they relate

        to matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied that the

        parties have settled the same amicably and without any

        pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of

        justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the

        exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the

        subsequent criminal proceedings.

               13.  There has been an outburst of matrimonial

        disputes in recent times.     The institution of marriage

        occupies an important place and it has an important role

        to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

        made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable

        them to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the

        parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their

        disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

        fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete

        justice in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be

        less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction.

        It is trite to state that the power under Section 482

        should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

        only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material

        on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

        would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the

        ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to be

        quashed."

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                             :-8-:


Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings are

initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose among

the parties and both the disputes are now amicably settled

between the parties. According to me, in the light of the facts

and    circumstances   involved   in the present      case    and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties

to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2704 of 2013
                            :-9-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 F.I.R and Annexure-2 Final Report in Crime No.30

of 2012 of Oachira Police Station and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.833 of 2012 on the

file  of   the    Judicial First    Class  Magistrate  Court,

                   Crl.M.C.No.2455 of 2014
           -------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 27th day of May, 2014

                               ORDER

     This is an application filed by accused numbers 1 and 2 in

C.C No.665/2012 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate - I, Thiruvananthapuram to quash the proceedings on

the basis of settlement u/s 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are arrayed as

accused numbers 1 and 2 in C.C No.665/2012 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate - I, Thiruvananthapuram which

arose on the basis of crime registered as Crime No.649/2012 of

Sreekariyam Police Station on the basis of the statement given by

second respondent as de facto complainant alleging commission of

offences under Sections 294(b), 323 and 324 r/w Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed and

it was taken on file as C.C No.665/2012 and now it is pending

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014                 2




before Judicial First Class Magistrate - I, Thiruvananthapuram.

The matter has been settled between the parties. In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and allowing the

case to proceed will only amount to wastage of judicial time.

Since some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they

cannot file application for compounding before the concerned

court. So they have no other remedy except to approach this court

seeking the following relief:

             i)   Quash all further proceedings in Annexure
                  A final report in C.C No.665/2012 pending
                  on   the   file  of   Judicial First Class
                  Magistrate Court - I, Thiruvananthapuram
                  in the interest of justice.


      3.    Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

he has no objection in quashing the proceedings and he had filed

an affidavit stating these facts.

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014              3




      4. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that in view of

the settlement there is no possibility of conviction and he prayed

for allowing the application.

      5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as directed by

this court, submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioners but opposed the application.

      6. Heard both sides.

      7.   It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent as de facto complainant, a case

was registered as Crime No.649/2012 of Sreekariyam Police

Station against the petitioners alleging offences u/s 294(b), 323

and 324       r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, Annexure A final report was filed which was taken

on file as C.C No.665/2012 and is pending before Judicial First

Class Magistrate - I, Thiruvananthapuram. Now, the matter has

been settled between the parties.     Second respondent has filed

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014                 4




Annexure B affidavit stating that in view of the settlement, he does

not want to proceed with the case and they are neighbours and on

account of the settlement their old relationship has been restored.

So, considering the fact that it is a matter arose due to some dispute

between the neighbours which has been settled on account of

intervention of mediators, there will not be any possibility of

conviction if the case is allowed to proceed with as neither de facto

complainant nor the witnesses will support the case. Further there

is no public interest involved as well as it is a private dispute

between the parties which resulted in the registration of the crime.

      8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:

                       "The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the power
           of the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding
           or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
           given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is
           of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014                 5




           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
           justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
           where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
           of each case and no category can be prescribed.
           However, before exercise of such power, the High
           Court must have due regard to the nature and
           gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
           mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
           though the victim or victim's family and the offender
           have settled the dispute.      Such offences are not
           private in nature and have serious impact on society.
           Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
           offender in relation to the offences under special
           statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
           offences committed by public servants while working
           in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
           quashing     criminal   proceedings    involving   such
           offences.        But   the   criminal   cases    having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership
           or such like transactions or the offences arising out
           of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
           words, the High Court must consider whether it
           would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014                 6




           to    continue  with   the   criminal   proceeding   or
           continuation    of  the   criminal  proceeding    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
           settlement and compromise between the victim and
           wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
           it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if
           the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
           the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
           quash the criminal proceeding."




      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled between

the parties due to the intervention of mediators and friends and on

account of the settlement their old relationship has been restored

and possibility of conviction is remote, this court feels that it is a

fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the

settlement and the restoration of harmony between neighbours.

       In the result the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C No.665/2012 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate - I, Thiruvananthapuram as against the petitioners is

Crl.M.C No.2455/2014            7




quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court immediately for necessary further action in the matter.

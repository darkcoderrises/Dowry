                     .................................................
                       Crl.M.C.No.1475 of 2014
                    ..................................................
                Dated this the 7th day of March, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


       This is an    application filed             by      the accused in Crime

No.165/13 of Elathur police station to quash the proceedings in

view of the settlement under Section 482 of the                             Code of

Criminal Procedure.

       2. It is alleged in the petition that a crime was registered

on the basis of a complaint given by the first respondent against

the petitioner alleging that derogatory message has been

published through face-book social network                           and thereby she

had committed the offence punishable under Section                          66 A of

the Information Technology Act and a crime was registered as

Crime No.165/2013 of Elathur police station                         and investigation

is still in progress. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner

is none other than the wife of the first respondent and there

were other cases pending between them in the family court

and due to intervention            of mediators and others, the entire

disputes between them have been settled and they decided to

part with as well.      The        respondent does not want to proceed

Crl.M.C.No.1475 of 2014                2

with further prosecution in the case. Since investigation is in

the prime stage,       it is not possible to drop the proceedings by

the police. There is no possibility of any conviction as well in

view of the settlement. So the petitioner has no other option

except to approach this Court seeking the following relief:



          For these and other grounds that may be urged at the
          time of hearing, it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble
          Court may be pleased to quash Annexure-1, the FIR
          in Cr.No.165/2013 of Elathur Police, Kozhikode dated
          24.4.2012 so as to secure the ends of justice.

      3. The first respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and    all the disputes between them have been settled due to

intervention of     mediators and family members and Annexure

A5 settlement was entered into between them and he does not

want to prosecute the petitioner and he has no objection in

quashing the proceedings.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor,on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that the impugned publication

could not be traced           out and investigation is in preliminary

stage and opposed the application.

Crl.M.C.No.1475 of 2014            3

      5. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and the first

respondent were husband and wife and due to some

misunderstanding in their family life, they fell apart and it is

alleged in the complaint that       misusing   the face book social

network, the petitioner had published             some defamatory

statement against the first respondent . But now the matter

has been settled between the parties evidenced by Annexure

A5 affidavit. Further, no incriminating articles have been so

far recovered as well. In view of the fact that though it is a

matter of serious social concern and now a days that internet

domain has been misused           by several persons and it has

become a      menace in the society which has to be         seriously

looked    into and dealt with       as it affect the life of several

persons. But considering the fact that it is a matter between

the wife and husband and they do not want to expose it further

in view of the settlement arrived at between them, no purpose

will be served in allowing the investigation to continue as well.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

           "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

Crl.M.C.No.1475 of 2014                 4

           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
           for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
           arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
           partnership or such like transactions or the offences
           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
           may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
           of the compromise between the offender and victim,
           the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
           continuation of criminal case would put accused to
           great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
           case   despite    full and   complete   settlement   and
           compromise with the victim. In other words, the High
           Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
           contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
           criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal
           proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of
           law despite settlement and compromise between the
           victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
           of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
           an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
           affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
           jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




        7. Further in the decision          reported above, it has been

held that if it is a family dispute between the parties and the

matter has been settled between the parties due to intervention

of mediators, then that must be promoted by the courts and

pendeny of a crime should not be a hurdle for such settlement.

So considering the fact that the matter has been settled between

the   parties and no purpose will be served                 by allowing the

prosecution to continue as even the investigating agency will

not be able to collect materials to book the accused in the case

Crl.M.C.No.1475 of 2014           5

and the prosecution will only a farse attempt and it will be a

wastage    of   judicial time    as   well.   So   considering  the

circumstances, this court feels that it is a fit case where power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked    to quash the proceedings in order to safeguard the

interest of the petitioner and the respondent to lead a happy

life in future and this would not be a hurdle in their future

life. So, the application is allowed and       further proceeding in

Crime No.165/2013 of Elathur police station against the

petitioner evidenced by Annexure A1 is quashed.

      Office is directed to    communicate this        order to the

concerned court before whom the First Information Report is

filed so as to inform the concerned police station for closing the

case and take further action in this regard.

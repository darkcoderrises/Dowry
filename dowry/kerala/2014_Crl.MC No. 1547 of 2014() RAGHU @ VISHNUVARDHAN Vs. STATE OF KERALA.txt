                    .................................................
                       Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014
                    ..................................................
               Dated this the 14th day of March, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


      This is     an application filed                  by the 4th accused in

C.C.No.113/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod to quash the proceedings as against the

petitioner on the basis of the settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the 4th

accused in C.C.No.113/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate     Court, Kasaragod              which was originated           as per

Crime No.486/2011 of Vidyanagar police station registered on

the basis of a statement given by the second                            respondent

against the petitioner and others alleging the offences under

Sections 341, 323, 324, 506(ii), 452 and 427 read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.                  The matter has been settled

between the petitioner and the respondents. Since some of the

offences are now compoundable in nature, the petitioner cannot

move the court below for recording compounding. So he has no

other option but to approach this Court seeking the following

Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014              2

relief:

          In view of the above grounds and the grounds that
          may be urged at the time of hearing this Hon'ble Court
          may be     pleased to    quash    all further proceedings
          pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.113/2012 on
          the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.



      4. Respondents 2 and 3, who are the defacto complaint

and the injured in the case, have entered appearance through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between them and the petitioner and they have no grievance

against the petitioner now and the petition can be allowed.

The counsel also submitted that respondents 2 and 3                 have

filed Annexures A2 and A2(a) affidavits regarding this aspect.

The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction as against the

petitioner and prayed for allowing the application.

         5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that the petitioner was an

accused in Crime No.329/2006 of Kasaragod                  police station

and that case was quashed by this Court invoking the power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and

opposed the application.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a statement

Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014         3

given by the second respondent as defacto complaint, a crime

was registered as Crime No.486/2011 of Vidyanagar police

station     against the petitioner and others alleging offences

under Sections 341, 323, 324, 506(ii), 452 and 427 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and after investigation

Annexure- A1 final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.113/2012       and pending before     the Chief    Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod. It is also an admitted fact that

the petitioner was shown as the 4th accused in the case. It is

seen    from   Annexures-A2    and   A2(a)   affidavits filed  by

respondents 2 and 3, who are the defacto complainant and the

injured in the case, that the matter has been settled between the

petitioner and respondents 2 and 3 and they have no objection

in quashing the proceedings as against them. Further, it is also

submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that the present

petitioner is expecting a job in   Gulf and the pendency of this

case may affect his employment opportunity abroad.

       7. Normally this Court will not allow piece meal quashing

in respect of some of the accused persons alone invoking the

power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

because that will not serve the purpose as the court below

Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014           4

has to proceed with the case as against the other accused

persons. But considering the fact that the allegations regarding

involvement of the petitioner and also considering the fact that

he has got an employment opportunity and it is likely to be

affected on account of this case and the matter has been settled

between the parties, this Court, as an exception, feels that the

request for quashing can be considered

      8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
          different footing for the purposes of quashing,
          particularly   the    offences    arising    from
          commercial,     financial   mercantile,      civil,
          partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature
          and the parties have resolved their entire
          dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because    of  the  compromise     between    the
          offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
          is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
          case would put accused to great oppression and
          prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
          full and complete settlement and compromise
          with the victim. In other words, the High Court
          must consider whether it would be unfair or
          contrary to the interest of justice to continue

Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014          5

          with the criminal proceedings or continuation of
          the criminal proceedings would tantamount to
          abuse of process of law despite settlement and
          compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
          and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
          appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
          and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
          affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
          its   jurisdiction to   quash    the   criminal
          proceeding."



      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the defacto complainant and the injured and the

petitioner, who is the 4th accused in the case and no purpose will

be served in proceeding with the case as against the petitioner

and pendency of this case is likely to affect his employment

opportunity and another crime in which the petitioner was an

accused was also quashed by this Court, this Court feels that

the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

can be invoked in favour of the petitioner to quash proceedings

as against him. So this petition is allowed and further

proceedings     in   C.C.No.113/2012    (Crime    No.486/2011  of

Vidyanagar police station) pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod as          against the petitioner is

quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.1547 of 2014            6

       Office is directed to       communicate this order to the

concerned court for necessary further action.

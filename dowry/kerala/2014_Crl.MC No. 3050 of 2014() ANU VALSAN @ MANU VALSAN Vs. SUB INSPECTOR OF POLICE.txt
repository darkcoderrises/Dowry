                         Crl. M.C. No.3050 of 2014
                         and Crl.M.C.No.3135/2014
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 13th day of June, 2014


                                    O R D E R


          CRMC 3050/14 was filed by the 2nd accused in

C.C.41/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Pathanamthitta, and Crl. M.C.3015/2014 filed by

accused Nos. 1 and 3 in the same case, both for quashing

the proceedings, on the basis of settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called

the Code).

          2.      The common allegation in both the petition

was that, the petitioners were arrayed as accused Nos. 1 to

3 in Crime No.476/2012 of Konni Police Station, which was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the 3rd

respondent in both the cases, alleging commission of the

offences under Section 447, 294(b), 323 read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code and after investigation, final

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.533/2012

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                   2

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Pathanamthitta, and after a notification was issued under

Section 25 of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights

Act, 2005, designating the Principal Sessions Court as

Special Court for trying of such offences, the learned

magistrate converted the same into C.P.41/2013. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. No purpose

will be served in proceeding with the case. Since it is a

case triable by Sessions Court, the magistrate will not allow

compounding. So the petitioners in both cases have no

other remedy, except to approach this court, seeking the

following relief:

            "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court
      my be pleased to quash Annexure-1 FIR, and Annexure-3
      final   report   and     all  further   proceedings in
      C.C.No.41/2013 on the file of the court of the Judicial
      First Class Magistrate-II, Pathanamthitta".

            3.    3rd respondent appeared through counsel and

filed affidavit in both the cases, stating that, the matter has

been settled and he has no objection in quashing the

proceedings.

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                  3

            4.   The counsel for the petitioner in both the

cases submitted that, after the case was converted to C.P.

41/2013, now it has been committed to the Principal

Sessions Court, but the Sessions Court has not taken

cognizance of the case so far and no summons has been

issued from that court. In view of the fact that the matter

has been settled, no purpose will be served and so he

prayed for allowing the prosecution.

            5.   The      learned   Public    Prosecutor,     on

instructions as directed by this court, submitted that,

except this case there no other case against the petitioners

and since it is a case involving the child's right, the power

under Section 482 cannot be invoked to quash the

proceedings.

            6.   It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 3rd respondent, while he was a child,

crime No.476/2012 of Konny police station was registered

against the petitioners in both the cases, arraying them as

accused Nos. 1 to 3 for the offences under Section 447, 423,

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                  4

294(b) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and

after investigation, final report was filed and it was

originally     taken as C.C.No.533/2012 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Pathanamthitta.

After the establishment of Special Courts under Section 25

of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005,

designating Principal Sessions Court as Special Courts for

trial of cases involving child or child's right, the learned

magistrate converted the same as C.P.No.41/2013 and it is

now submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that,

magistrate has already committed the case to Principal

Sessions Court but it was not taken on file so far in that

court and no summons has been issued from that court. It

is true that Special Courts have been constituted under the

above said Act for the purpose of Protecting the Rights of

Children and their rights, if they have been violated, taking

into account that, the children are being abused and their

rights have been violated and none to protect them and if it

is brought to the notice of the court, then that will have to

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                  5

be seriously dealt with. With that intention, the Special

Courts have been constituted under the above said Act in

respect of cases involving children or their right. At the

time when the incident happened, the petitioners and the

defacto-complainant were students and without knowing

the consequences of the incidents, some incident happened,

which resulted in the registration of the crime. Now the

child has become major and he had decided to forgive the

petitioners and he does not want to prosecute them as well.

Further considering the nature of allegations made and also

the trivial nature of offences alleged and since it has been

settled between the parties and the relationship has been

restored, no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case, as even the defacto-complainant will not support the

case of the prosecution and conviction in such cases will be

remote. So under such circumstances, allowing the

prosecution to continue will amount only wastage of judicial

time.

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                       6

            7.     Further in the decision reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)],

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

Crl. M.C.Nos.3050 and 3135 of 2014
                                      7

      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and the defacto-

complainant, who was a child at the time of the alleged

incident and has become major now and he does not want

to prosecute the case, in view of the settlement arrived at

due to the intervention of well-wishers of both parties and

the relationship has been restored and conviction in such

cases will be remote, this court feels that, it is a fit case

where the power under Section 482 has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings to promote harmony that has been

restored between the parties on account of the settlement.

             So the applications are allowed and further

proceedings in C.P.No.41/2013 (old C.C.No.533/2013 in

crime No.476/2012 of Konny Police Station) pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Pathanamthitta,

which has now been committed to the Principal Sessions

                                   8

Court, as against the petitioners is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Pathanamthitta, and also to

Principal Sessions Court, Pathanamthitta, where the case

has to be tried after taking cognisance, as the case has

already been committed according to the counsel for the


petitioner, for necessary further action in this regard.

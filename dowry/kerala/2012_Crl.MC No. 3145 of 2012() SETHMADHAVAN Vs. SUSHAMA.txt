               Crl.M.C. NO. 3145 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 05th day of November, 2012

                            ORDER


           Petitioner is the accused in a pending case

numbered as C.C. No. 539 of 2010 on the file of Judicial First

Class Magistrate, Ottapalam. He is being prosecuted for the

offence punishable under Section 498A, on a report filed by

the Sub Inspector of Police, Ottapalam Police Station. Crime

in the above case was registered against the petitioner on a

complaint from his wife, the first respondent, imputing

matrimonial cruelty and harassment demanding dowry. Now

after his indictment in the aforesaid offence on the report

filed by the police after investigation, it is submitted that the

spouses have resolved their matrimonial disputes deciding to

severe their relationship. A petition for divorce by mutual

consent moved before the Family Court has been granted by

that court. A copy of the Judgment rendered by the Family

Court, Palakkad, is produced. The de facto complainant/wife

Crl.M.C. NO. 3145 of 2012       2



is no longer interested in prosecuting the petitioner/her

former husband, is the submission of her counsel. Cessation

of the criminal proceedings against the petitioner which arose

on the complaint of the former wife is canvassed by both

sides urging for exercise of inherent powers of this court to

quash such proceedings. The Apex Court in Gian Singh Vs.

State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) has held that even

in cases involving non-compoundable offences where such

offences have predominantly a civil flavour or arise from

matrimonial disputes, settlement effected by the parties can

be taken due note of by this court to exercise its inherent

powers for quashing such proceedings.       In the facts and

circumstances presented in the case where the spouses have

severed their matrimonial relationship by a decree passed by

the competent court, on mutual consent, the settlement

effected by them deserves to be taken into account to

consider    whether continuation of the criminal proceedings

against the petitioner/husband is called for.     Even if the

prosecution is continued against the petitioner in view of the

Crl.M.C. NO. 3145 of 2012         3



settlement effected by the parties there is remote chance of

such prosecution resulting in his conviction. It may at best

result only in wastage of precious time of the court. That

also being taken note of, I find exercise of the inherent

powers of this court to quash the criminal proceedings

against the petitioner/accused is called for.

            Criminal        proceedings      against      the

petitioner/accused in C.C. No.539 of 2010 on the file of

Judicial First Class Magistrate, Ottapalam, are quashed under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

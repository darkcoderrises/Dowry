               Crl.M.C. NO. 3154 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 07th day of November, 2012

                            ORDER


           Petitioners are the accused in a pending case

numbered as C.C. No.724 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate, Alathur. They are being prosecuted for

the offence punishable under Section 498(A) read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code, on a report filed by the Sub

Inspector of Police, Nemmara Police Station.     Crime in the

above case was registered on a complaint given by the first

respondent, who is the wife of the first petitioner (A1),

imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment by her husband

and his close relatives demanding dowry. Now the spouses

have resolved their disputes and are living together, is the

submission of the learned counsel for petitioners to quash the

criminal proceedings against them in exercise of the inherent

powers of this court, under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, for short the 'Code'.

Crl.M.C. NO. 3154 of 2012       2




            2.     Learned counsel appearing for the first

respondent, wife, endorses the submissions made as above.

Learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions also

reports that the spouses resolving their matrimonial disputes

are living together under the common roof. In such

circumstance, I find continuation of the criminal proceedings

that too on the basis of a crime registered on the complaint of

the wife would only rupture the renewed matrimonial

relationship between the spouses. The Apex Court in Gian

Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) has

held that in crime cases involving non compoundable offences

where the offences imputed have predominantly civil flavour or

arise from matrimonial disputes settlement effected by the

parties can be taken due note of and recognized by this court

to exercise its inherent powers to quash the criminal

proceedings. In the facts and circumstances presented and

taking note of the settlement effected by the parties and also

that the spouses are stated to be living together, criminal

Crl.M.C. NO. 3154 of 2012         3



proceedings against the petitioners/accused in C.C. No. 724 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Alathur,

are quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

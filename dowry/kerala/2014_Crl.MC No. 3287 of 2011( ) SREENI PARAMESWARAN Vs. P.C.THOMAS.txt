                             A.HARIPRASAD, J.
                        --------------------------------------
                        Crl.M.C. No.3287 of 2011
                        --------------------------------------
                Dated this the 14th day of July, 2014.

                                     ORDER

            Petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (in short, "Cr.P.C.").

      2.    Prayer in the petition reads as follows:

                  "Hence, it is most humbly prayed that this

           Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash Annexure A-

           1 FIR in Crime No.1157 of 2011 on the files of the

           Ernakulam Town South Police Station, Ernakulam

           District filed before the Additional Chief Judicial

           Magistrate's Court (Economic Offences), Ernakulam

           and thus render justice."

      3.    Subsequently, respondents 3 and 4, who are HDFC Ltd. and

Axis Bank, were impleaded. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners.

1st respondent/complainant is represented through a counsel. Learned

counsel appearing for the additional 3rd respondent is also heard. There

was no representation for the 4th respondent Learned Public Prosecutor is

also heard.

      4.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the dispute

Crl.MC No.3287/2011                       2

is relating to allotment of villas by a builder to the customers. They have

settled the matter out of court. Annexure-A2 is the agreement executed

between the parties showing the terms of settlement between the parties.

My attention is drawn to the statement dated 13.04.2012 filed by the

Investigating Officer. Along with that statement, the statement of the 1st

respondent/complainant recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was also

produced. It has been clearly mentioned therein that the matter has been

settled between the defacto complainant and the accused. The offences

alleged against the petitioners are punishable under Sections 406, 465,

468, 471 and 420 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Relying

on the dictum in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108-SC),

learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the jurisdiction of this

Court may be invoked to terminate the proceedings as continuation of the

prosecution is not required as the parties have completely settled their

disputes. Further, this is basically a civil dispute. Therefore, proposition of

law stated in paragraph 57 of the above cited decision is relied on to seek

reliefs. Paragraph 57 in Gian Singh's case reads as follows:

                       "The position that emerges from the above

                discussion can be summarised thus: the power of

                the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or

                FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

                jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

Crl.MC No.3287/2011                       3

                given to a criminal court for compounding the

                offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power

                is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

                has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

                engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the ends

                of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

                any Court. In what cases power to quash the

                criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

                exercised where the offender and victim have

                settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

                circumstances of each case and no category can be

                prescribed. However, before exercise of such

                power, the High Court must have due regard to the

                nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and

                serious offences of mental depravity or offences like

                murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

                quashed even though the victim or victim's family

                and the offender have settled the dispute. Such

                offences are not private in nature and have serious

                impact on society. Similarly, any compromise

                between the victim and offender in relation to the

                offences under special statutes like Prevention of

                Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

                servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot

                provide for any basis for quashing criminal

                proceedings involving       such offences. But the

                criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

                dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

Crl.MC No.3287/2011                       4

                for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

                offences     arising   from   commercial,    financial,

                mercantile,     civil,  partnership   or   such    like

                transactions    or    the offences    arising  out   of

                matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family

                disputes where the wrong is basically private or

                personal in nature and the parties have resolved

                their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

                Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

                because of the compromise between the offender

                and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

                and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

                put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

                extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

                quashing the criminal case despite full and

                complete settlement and compromise with the

                victim. In other words, the High Court must consider

                whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest

                of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or

                continuation of the criminal proceeding would

                tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

                settlement and compromise between the victim and

                wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of

                justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

                an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is

                in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

                jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.MC No.3287/2011                        5

Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also the fact that

the respondents have no grievance against the petitioners/accused, I find

that the prosecution can be terminated to meet the ends of justice.

                In the result, the petition is allowed. First information report in

Crime No.1156 of 2011 of Ernakulam Town South Police Station, now

pending before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court (Economic

Offences), Ernakulam is hereby quashed.

       All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.




                                                  A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

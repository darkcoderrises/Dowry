           ---------------------------------------
                 B.A. No. 9109 of 2014
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 26th day of December, 2014

                           ORDER



      Accused numbers 1 and 2 in Crime No. 2320 of 2014 of

Adoor Police Station have filed this petition for anticipatory

bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the

first petitioner married the de facto complainant on

05.11.2009, and thereafter they were living together as

husband and wife, while so the accused have ill treated her

demanding more dowry and thereby they have committed

the offence under Section 498(A) read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

      3. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the

petitioners have not committed any offence and they are

innocent of the same and they have been falsely implicated

in the case. No offence under Section 498 (A) is attracted.

B.A. No. 9109 of 2014             2



They further submitted that they are prepared to abide by

any condition imposed by this Court.

      4. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor

on the ground that the investigation is not over.

      5. Heard both sides.

      6.    It is seen from the documents produced by the

petitioners, who are accused 1 and 2, that a case was

registered by Adoor Police as Crime No.2320 of 2014 of

Adoor Police Station, against the petitioners and the third

accused who is the Sister of the first accused alleging offence

under Section 498(A) read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code,

on the basis of the statement given by the de facto

complainant, none other than the wife of the first petitioner.

I am not at this stage going into the question as to whether

the allegations are sufficient to attract the offence alleged.

Being a matrimonial dispute putting the husband and in-laws

in jail will only affect the prospects of settlement in future.

While considering the allegations, the custodial interrogation

of the petitioners are also not required. So, considering the

circumstances, this Court feels that anticipatory bail can be

granted to the petitioners with some conditions. So the

B.A. No. 9109 of 2014              3



application is allowed to the following conditions:




             1. The petitioners, if arrested in connection

      with Crime No. 2320 of 2014 of the Adoor Police

      Station, are directed to be released on bail, on

      executing a bond for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty

      five thousand only) each with two solvent

      sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction

      of the arresting officer/ investigating officer/

      respondent as the case may be.

             2. Petitioners shall appear before the

      investigating officer for two consecutive days for

      the purpose of interrogation, between 9.00 a.m.,

      and 12.00 noon, immediately after such arrest

      and release and thereafter as and when required

      by him for this purpose in writing to do so, till

      the final report is filed.

             3.   Petitioners   shall  not  influence   or

      intimidate the witnesses.

             4. Petitioners shall not leave the State of

      Kerala without getting prior permission from the

B.A. No. 9109 of 2014            4



      Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adoor, till

      the disposal of the case.

             5. If the petitioners surrender before the

      Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adoor, and

      move      for  regular bail,  then   the   learned

      Magistrate is directed to release them on bail on

      the same conditions as stated above.

      With the above conditions, the petition is allowed.

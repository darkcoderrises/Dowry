                  Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No. 284

of 2011 of Chelakkara Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 420, 406 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash Annexure I First information Report in Crime

No.284/2011 of Chelakkara Police Station in the interest of

justice as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner/accused collected an amount of Rs.60,000/- from

the petitioner in order to deposit in FLOREZSA RTP net work

and thereby cheated the de facto complainant offering with

interest based upon the said complaint a crime was registered

against the petitioners as Cr.No.284/2011 of Chelakkara police

station and now, the case of the petitioner/s is that the matter

is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
                                  2

            4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.               Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

            5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

            6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

            7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only 420, 406 r/w 34 of I.P.C which are

Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
                                    3

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me

that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                   "57. The position that emerges from

           the above discussion can be summarised

           thus:       the power of the High Court in

           quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

           complaint      in exercise   of   its  inherent

           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

           power       given to   a  criminal   court  for

           compounding the offences under S.320 of

           the Code.        Inherent power is of wide

           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
                                   4

           has to be exercised in accord with the

           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

           abuse of the process of any Court. In what

           cases      power   to  quash   the    criminal

           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

           exercised where the offender and victim

           have settled their dispute would depend on

           the facts and circumstances of each case

           and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having

            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

            flavour stand on different footing for the

            purposes     of quashing,   particularly the

            offences     arising   from     commercial,

            financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

            such like transactions or the offences

            arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

            etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

            is basically private or personal in nature

Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
                                    5

            and the parties have resolved their entire

            dispute.     In this category of cases, High

            Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

            its   view,    because  of   the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

            and continuation of criminal case would put

            accused to great oppression and prejudice

            and extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal case

            despite     full and complete settlement and

            compromise with the victim........"

            According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.NO. 1872 of 2013
                                6

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

            In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -I First Information Report       and in Crime No.

284/2011 of Chelakkara Police Station and all further

proceedings thereto.

                  Crl.M.C.No. 1797 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 28th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 5 in Crime

No.245/11     of Vidyanagar      Police Station to quash the

proceedings on the basis of the settlement under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 to 5 in Crime No.245/11 of Vidyanagar Police

Station now pending as C.C.No.404/2011 on the file of Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasargod which was registered on

the basis of the statement given by the de facto complainant

who is the first respondent herein alleging offence under

Sections 143,147, 148, 341, 323, 324 read with Section 149 of

Indian Penal Code. The matter has been settled between the

parties and there is no disputes subsisting between the parties.

The settlement was arrived at on the basis of the intervention

of mediators and friends.        No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the investigation.       So, they have no other

option except to approach this court seeking the following

relief:

Crl.M.C.No. 1797 of 2014     :  2 :


            "To quash the Annexure.A-1, Final Report and all

     further proceedings in C.C.No.404/2011 of Chief Judicial

     Magistrate      Court, Kasargod    as    against    the

     petitioners/accused persons in this petition, in the

     interest of justice."

      3.     First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he has no objection in quashing the proceedings.

The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of

the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the investigation and he prayed for allowing the application.

      4.     Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioners and they have no criminal

background but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by first respondent who is the de facto

complainant, Vidyanagar police has registered a case against

the petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143,147, 148,

341, 323, 324 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, final report has been filed and it is now

pending as C.C.No.404/11 on the files of Chief Judicial

Crl.M.C.No. 1797 of 2014          :  3 :

Magistrate Court, Kasargod. In the meantime the petitioners

and the de facto complainant had settled the claim due to the

intervention of mediators and that is evidenced by Annexure

A2 affidavit of the de facto complainant.                  In view of the

settlement of the matter, the de facto complainant or his

witness will support the case of the prosecution and no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case as well.

      6.      Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
     the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
     offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
     plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
     in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
     secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
     process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
     criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
     where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
     depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
     category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
     power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
     gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
     depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
     be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
     and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
     not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
     Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
     relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
     Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
     while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
     for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
     the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

Crl.M.C.No. 1797 of 2014           :  4 :

     civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
     quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
     financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions
     or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc;
     or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
     personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
     dispute.   In this category of case, High Court may quash
     criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
     between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
     remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
     accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
     injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
     case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
     the victim.    In other words, the High Court must consider
     whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
     to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
     criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
     law despite settlement and compromise between the victim
     and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
     appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer to
     the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
     well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



       7.     Considering the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties due to the intervention of

mediators and no purpose will be served in allowing the

prosecution to continue with the trial of the case as the de

facto complainant or his witness will support the case of the

prosecution, this court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to

be invoked to quash the proceedings as proceeding with the

investigation will only amount to wastage of judicial time.

        So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crl.M.C.No. 1797 of 2014    : 5 :

C.C.No.404/2011 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasargod, (Crime No.245/11 of Vidyanagar Police

Station) against the petitioners is quashed. Office is directed

to communicate this order to the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasargod to inform the concerned police station about

the order for necessary further action.

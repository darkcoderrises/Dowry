                  ================
                 Crl.M.C. No. 5830 of 2014
            =======================
           Dated this the 20th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.58 of 2012 of the

Perinthalmanna Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting all further proceedings in

C.C.No.1174 of 2013, arising out of Crime No.58 of 2012 of the

Perinthalmanna Police Station, pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-II, Perinthalmanna, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

Crl.M.C. No. 5830 of 2014
                                2

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the petitioners   and,   therefore,  the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd  respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.             She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.   Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life.      When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioners, it

                                  3

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and       all further

proceedings in C.C.No.1174 of 2013, arising out of Crime No.58

of 2012 of the Perinthalmanna Police Station, pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Perinthalmanna,

are hereby quashed.

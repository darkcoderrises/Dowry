                Dated this the 5th day of February 2015

                                     ORDER


     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1250/2014 of

Pudussery Kasaba Police station, Palakkad district registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 of the I.P.C.

     3.     The grand daughter of the de-facto complainant was

given in marriage to the petitioner. It is alleged that after the

marriage she was being constantly tortured and harassed and she

was subjected to cruelty by demanding more dowry. Her father is

no more. She had complained about the cruelty from her husband,

to her mother and her brother. Still they insisted her to move along

BA.33/2015                        2



with the petitioner. She along with the child was residing with the

petitioner in Bihar, where he was conducting a bakery shop. As

she was afflicted with jaundice, her mother and brother went over

to Bihar and stayed along with them for some period and treated

her and thereafter, she along with the child were taken back to her

home for continued treatment. On 12.11.2014, the petitioner along

with the sister came over to the house of the deceased for attending

the birthday celebrations of the child. It is alleged that after the

birthday celebration, the petitioner gave as an ultimatum to the

deceased that she should procure dowry from her house and if not,

he would not take her back. He had also allegedly told her that, in

such case, she should die. It seems that on 15.11.2014 she was

found lying dead, as she had consumed poison.

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor.

      5. The contents of the C.D. Prima facie reveal the complicity

BA.33/2015                        3



of the petitioner. The investigation of this case is not over. The

allegations against the petitioner are very grave and serious.

Considering the seriousness of the allegations against the petitioner

and the present stage of investigation, I am satisfied that this is not

a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted.

      6.   The learned counsel for the petitioner seeks for an

opportunity to the petitioner to surrender before the investigating

officer and to co-operate with the investigation.

      7. In the result, this bail application is dismissed. At the

same time, if so advised, the petitioner may surrender before the

investigating officer within ten days from today and in such case,

the investigating officer can interrogate the petitioner, effect

recovery if any, and conduct the investigation and produce the

petitioner without delay before the concerned Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, where the petitioner can move for bail. In such

case, the learned Magistrate shall pass appropriate orders,

BA.33/2015                       4



preferably on the same day itself, provided advance notice on such

application has been given to the Assistant Public Prosecutor also.

       Dated this the 21stday of November, 2012

                        O R D E R




       Petitioners are the accused in a crime

registered at Nedumbassery Police Station for

offences punishable under Sections 498-A, 406

and 420 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.  That     crime      was     registered       on  the

complaint of the 2nd respondent-wife of the 1st

petitioner alleging matrimonial cruelty and

harassment demanding dowry by her husband and

his close relatives, the accused persons.               The

crime is now pending investigation.

       2. Spouses have resolved their disputes

and on a joint application moved by them, the

Crl.M.C.No.3413 of 2012

                       :: 2 ::


competent Family Court has granted a decree

dissolving their marriage, is the case canvassed

for quashing the proceedings arising from the

aforesaid crime. Second respondent is also

represented by a counsel.      That counsel also

submits that in view of the settlement effected

she is no longer interested in prosecuting the

accused persons. She has no more grievance any

of the accused, is the further submission of the

counsel.

        3.  Where the crime was registered on

account of matrimonial disputes of the spouses

and an amicable settlement has been entered

into by them after registration of crime, I find,

continuation     of   the   criminal proceedings

against the petitioner/accused is uncalled for.

Even if it is continued, that may not serve any

purpose.

Crl.M.C.No.3413 of 2012

                        :: 3 ::


        4. In that view of the matter, criminal

proceedings against the petitioners/accused,

arising from Annexure-I FIR of Nedumbassery

Police Station are quashed under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.

        Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

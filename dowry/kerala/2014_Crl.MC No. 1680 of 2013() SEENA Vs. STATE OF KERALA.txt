    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1680 of 2013
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 02nd day of April, 2014.


                          O R D E R




     This is an application field by the petitioner who is the

sole accused in C.C.No.3099/12 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kodungallur, to quash the proceedings

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petitioner is the accused in

Crime No.1288/12 registered by Mathilakam Police on the

basis of a private complaint filed by the second respondent

before the Magistrate Court which was forwarded to the Police

for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. The allegation was that, the complainant and the

accused entered in an agreement for sale of 6.75 cents of land

along with a house owned by the accused for Rs.19 lakhs on

31.10.2011 and the time for performance was fixed as six

months and an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- was paid as advance

and thereafter, the petitioner failed to execute the document

and thereby according to the complainant, the petitioner has

committed the offence under Sections 420 and 406 of Indian

Crl.M.C.No.1680 of 2013      :   2 :

Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed and the

case was taken on file as C.C.No.3099/12 under Sections 406

and 420 of Indian Penal Code. According to the petitioner,

none of the offences were made out and it is only a civil

dispute and so, he filed the above petition seeking the

following relief:

           "To quash Annexure B Final Report in Crime.1288 of

    2012 laid against the petitioner now pending in C.C.3099

    of 2012 before the JFCM Court, Kodungallur in the interest

    of justice."



      3.     Respondent appeared through Counsel and earlier

the application was opposed.         Later, the matter has been

settled between the parites out of court and second resopdonet

has now filed an affidavit stating that the matter has been

settled between the parties and he has no intension to

prosecute the case and now he has no grievance against the

petitioner as well.

      4.     Heard the Counsel for the petitioner, second

respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and second

respondent had entered into an agreement to sell in respect of

certain properties with the house belong to the petitioner and

Crl.M.C.No.1680 of 2013       :  3 :

some amount was paid as advance and later, the document

could not be executed within the time agreed upon bewteen

the parties.       That led to the second respondent to file

Annexure A private complaint before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kodungallur, against the petitioner alleging

offences under Sections 406 and 420 of Indian Penal Code

which was forwarded to the police for investigation and on that

basis, Mathilakam police has registered a case as Crime

No.1288/12        of   Mathilakam    Police  Station   and   after

investigation, Annexure B final report was field.       Now, the

matter has been settled between the parties and second

respondent has filed an affidavit stating that matter has been

settled out of court and he does not want to prosecute the

petitioner. Further, on going through the allegations, it is seen

that, it is a pure civil dispute and due to breach of promise, the

second respondent filed the complaint which has been now

been settled between the parties.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.

Crl.M.C.No.1680 of 2013        :  4 :

      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise

Crl.M.C.No.1680 of 2013         :  5 :

      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties which is of civil nature and no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the prosecution, this

court feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash

the proceedings.

          So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.3099/2012 (Crime No.1288 of Mathilakam police

station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Kodungallur, as against the petitioner is quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court immediately.

                 Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 5th day of July, 2013.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is 1st accused in

C.C.No.48/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Punalur, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No. 213/1997 of Kollam West Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 406,

408, 420 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings in the above calender case, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st and 2nd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

        3.  The    prosecution      allegation   against the

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013


petitioner/1st accused as well as the other accused is that

they availed a hire purchase facility of `1,10,000/- from the

2nd respondent for purchasing a Mini lorry bearing

registration No.KL-10-6690 but the petitioner repaid only

`48,400/- and thereafter failed to remit the equal monthly

instalments and violating the terms of the hire purchase

agreement, the petitioner transferred the vehicle to the 2nd

accused and thereby deceived the de facto complainant

and caused a loss to the tune of `1,22,100/- and thus they

committed the offences punishable under sections 406,

408, 420 r/w 34 of IPC. Now the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court between the

petitioner and the 1st and 2nd respondents as evident from

Annexure A5 compounding petition, which was filed before

the court below, but the same has not been acted upon by

the learned Magistrate.    But the learned Magistrate is

proceeding with the trial of the case in C.C.No.48/11. The

2nd respondent in the above M.C. entered appearance

through Adv.A.M.Babu and the learned counsel submitted

                              3
Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013


that as the case is settled out of court, the 2nd respondent

has no objection in dropping the proceedings pending

against the petitioner. The above submission of the

counsel for the 2nd respondent is recorded.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5.     The learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainants do not

intends to proceed any further against the petitioner and

they have no grievance against the accused.

         6.       I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

                             4
Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013


petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under sections 406,

408, 420 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents, it appears

to me that the de facto complainants have no further

grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

                                   5
Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013


108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having
         overwhelmingly     and   pre-dominatingly    civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or
         the offences arising out of matrimony relating
         to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because      of the  compromise     between    the
         offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
         is remote and bleak and continuation of
         criminal case would put accused to great
         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
         would be caused to him by not quashing the

                                6
Crl.M.C.No.1125 of 2013


         criminal case despite     full and complete
         settlement     and   compromise   with  the
         victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved in  the   present   case  and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the

trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to

me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C.

can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

C.C.No.48/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Punalur.

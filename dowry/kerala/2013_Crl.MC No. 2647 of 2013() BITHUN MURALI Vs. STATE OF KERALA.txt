                     Crl.M.C.No.2647 of 2013
               ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013

                             O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused in C.C.No.49 of 2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No.II, Perambra which is a

case instituted upon the police report [in Crime No.280 of

2012 of Atholy Police Station in Kozhikode district] for the

offences punishable under Section 379 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure-A Final Report and all further proceedings

in C.C.No.49 of 2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court No.II, Perambra as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner has stolen gold chain of the de facto complainant on

26.11.2012 and, thereby, the petitioner has committed the

offences punishable under Section 379 of I.P.C and now, the

case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled between the

petitioner and the defacto complainant on the next date of the

alleged occurrence. Annexure-B is the affidavit of the decfacto

complainant who is the second respondent in the above case.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner      as

Crl.M.C.No.2647 of 2013               2

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

                4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.                 Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

                5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received              from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

                6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

                7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No.2647 of 2013                  3

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Section 379 of I.P.C which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                       "57. The position that emerges from
                the above discussion can be summarised
                thus:     the power of the High Court in
                quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
                complaint    in   exercise   of   its  inherent
                jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
                power    given    to   a  criminal   court  for
                compounding the offences under S.320 of
                the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
                plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
                has to be exercised in accord with the
                guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
                secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
                abuse of the process of any Court. In what

Crl.M.C.No.2647 of 2013                4

                cases     power   to  quash   the   criminal
                proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
                exercised where the offender and victim
                have settled their dispute would depend on
                the facts and circumstances of each case
                and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

                "......... But the criminal cases having
                overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
                flavour stand on different footing for the
                purposes    of   quashing, particularly the
                offences arising from commercial, financial,
                mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
                transactions or the offences arising out of
                matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
                family disputes where the wrong is basically
                private or personal in nature and the
                parties have resolved their entire dispute.
                In this category of cases, High Court may
                quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
                because of the compromise between the
                offender and victim, the possibility of
                conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
                continuation of criminal case would put
                accused to great oppression and prejudice
                and extreme injustice would be caused to
                him by not quashing the criminal case
                despite    full and complete settlement and
                compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

Crl.M.C.No.2647 of 2013             5

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

                In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.49 of 2013 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court No.II, Perambra and all further

proceedings thereto.

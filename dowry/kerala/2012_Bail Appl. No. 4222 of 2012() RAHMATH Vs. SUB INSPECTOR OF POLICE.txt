                    B.A. No: 4222 of 2012
            ------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 26th day of June, 2012


                          O R D E R

     The petitioner is the 2nd accused in Crime No:143/2012

of Panniyankara Police Station.       The offences alleged are

under sections 498-A and 306 r/w 34 of IPC. Apprehending

arrest the petitioner has approached this Court for

anticipatory bail.

     2.    The wife of the 1st accused committed suicide on

29.04.2012 at the matrimonial home. This petitioner is the

sister of the 1st accused. The prosecution contends that the

1st accused (the husband of the deceased) and this

petitioner subjected the deceased to physical and mental

cruelty demanding more dowry and also by torturing her

otherwise.

     3.    Her application for anticipatory bail was rightly

dismissed by the learned Sessions Judge, finding that she

B.A. No: 4222/2012
                               -2-



was also a party to the cruel treatment meted out to the

deceased, which drove the deceased to commit suicide. The

2nd accused was/is residing in the very same house where

the deceased and 1st accused were staying.        The learned

counsel for the petitioner submits that except that the

petitioner is the sister of the 1st accused, there is no other

material to show that the petitioner instigated the

commission of suicide. It is resisted by the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    However, I am not inclined to grant pre-arrest bail

to this accused.

     The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

Officer within 10 days from today. After interrogation the

petitioner shall be produced before the Magistrate and if the

petitioner applies for bail the learned Magistrate will dispose

of the same in accordance with law, but after hearing the

learned APP as well and also after perusal of the case diary,

B.A. No: 4222/2012
                             -3-



if so required and also after considering the facts and

circumstances of the case. If the Investigating Officer files

application for police custody for further interrogation that

shall also be considered by the learned Magistrate in

accordance with law.

                      Crl.M.C No.815 of 2015
           ..............................................................
          Dated this the 11th day of March, 2015.


                             O R D E R

           Petitioners are accused in Crime No.744 of 2013 of

the Manjeri Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in

Crime No.744 of 2013 of the Manjeri Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.356 of 2014

pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Manjeri

quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C No.815 of 2015           2

     5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

     6.    The    defacto    complainant,    who     is  the  2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.            She has

entered appearance through her counsel. The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

     7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient

in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

Crl.M.C No.815 of 2015           3

above.

     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.744 of 2013 of the Manjeri Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.356

of 2014 pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court.

Manjeri are hereby quashed.

                              O R D E R

     This is a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

seeking to have all further proceedings in C.C.No. 2266/2013

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Chittur quashed. The petitioner stands accused of having

committed the offences punishable under Section 420 of IPC

and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

     2.   It is unnecessary to traverse into the facts and

details of the case for the simple reason that this petition

can be disposed of on a short ground.

     3.   The    petitioner        has      impleaded         the defacto

complainant/victim as the second respondent who has

entered appearance through a counsel.                         The counsel

appearing for the second respondent has accepted that

Annexure B affidavit produced along with the petition is one

sworn to by her and she stands by the statement contained

Crl.M.C. No. 4869 of 2013
                               -2-



therein.

      4.    On going through the affidavits so filed, it is seen

that the parties have settled all their disputes and

differences between themselves and they have no further

issues remain to be resolved. In the light of the stand taken

by the defacto complainant/victim that she do not wish to

prosecute the matter further, it is felt that continuance of

proceedings will be an exercise in futility.

      Hence, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings

in  in C.C.No. 2266/2013 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Chittur, including the final report

which arose out of Crime No.568/2013 of Kozhinjampara

Police Station shall stand quashed and the petitioner shall

stand discharged.

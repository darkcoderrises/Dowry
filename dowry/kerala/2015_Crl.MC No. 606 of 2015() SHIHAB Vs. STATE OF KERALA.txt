                  ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 606 of 2015
            =======================
           Dated this the 6th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1089 of 2012 of the

Aluva East Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A and 323 read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure

A3 Final Report in Crime No.1089/2012 of Aluva East Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.1021

of 2012 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-I, Aluva, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

Crl.M.C. No. 606 of 2015
                                  2

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against   the petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The    defacto  complainant,     who    is  the       3rd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against

the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.                She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

Crl.M.C. No. 606 of 2015
                                  3

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and   Annexure-A1

FIR and Annexure-A3 charge sheet in Crime No.1089/2012 of

Aluva East Police Station and all further proceedings based on

it, in C.C.No.1021 of 2012 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Aluva, are hereby quashed.

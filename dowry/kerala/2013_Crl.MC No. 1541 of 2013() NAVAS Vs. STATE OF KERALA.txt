                        Crl.M.C.No. 1541 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 25th day of June, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 6 in C.C.No. 816 of 2010        of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor,           which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 543 of 2010 of

Perumbavoor Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

498A,506(II),354 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure A-1 charge sheet and drop all proceedings in C.C.No.816 of

2010 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Perumbavoor as the matter is settled out of court.

      2.     The allegation in the above case is that the first petitioner

married the de facto complainant and at the time of marriage, the de facto

complainant has brought `1,50,000/- and 30 sovereigns of gold to the

matrimonial house and after marriage,the first petitioner had gone abroad

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                    :-2-:

for taking job, but the petitioner and other accused, thereafter, harassed the

de facto complainant stating that the dowry given was very low and

demanding more money and gold ornaments, and according to the de facto

complainant, she was subjected to cruelty by mentally and physically and

thus, she preferred a complaint before the court which eventually resulted

in instituting C.C.No.816 of 2010 in the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Perumbavoor and now the case of the petitioner is that the matter is

settled between the petitioners and the second respondent, who is the de

facto complainant as per the mediation agreement arrived at the Mediation

Centre at Family Court, Ernakulam. Now, they are residing separately on

mutual divorce.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received      from the second respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does

not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no

grievance against her.

         6.  I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.    Annexure A3 is the mediation agreement and

Annexure A4 is the receipt. The second respondent has already filed an

affidavit dated 30.3.2013. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.           In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

Sections 498A,506(II),354 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                       :-4-:

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the second respondent, it

appears to me that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.    In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                            :-5-:

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                            :-6-:

Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court has held as

follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

         considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

         also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

         home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.


                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                             :-7-:

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                 13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent

         times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place and it has

         an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

         made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to settle

         down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults

         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                            :-8-:

         fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in the

         matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

         extraordinary jurisdiction.    It is trite to state that the power under

         Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only

         when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this case, it can be

seen further that the criminal proceedings are initiated consequent to the

matrimonial dispute arose among the parties and both the disputes are now

amicably settled between the parties. According to me, in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decisions will be squarely applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty

of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of the trial proceeded, there would not

Crl.M.C.No.1541 of 2013

                                  :-9-:

have been any fruitful prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

as sought for.

                    In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A-1 charge sheet and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in C.C.No. 816 of 2010 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor.

              ------------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.3152 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.No.701 of 2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kottarakkara which is a case instituted upon the police report

in Crime No.609 of 2011 of Chadayamangalam Police Station

for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 451,

294(b), 506(1), 427 & 323 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. with

a prayer to quash all the further proceedings in C.C.No.701 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kottarakkara as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The allegation of the prosecution in Annexure-A1 is

that on 21/5/2011, at about 11 A.M. petitioners along with 10

others who can be identified by sight trespassed into the

house of the 2nd respondent and used filthy language and

destructed chairs and tables etc, thereby he sustained loss to

Crl.M.C.No.3152 of 2013
                             :-2-:


the extent of `10,000/-. It is alleged that the attempt of the

petitioners was to take forcefully the daughter (wife of the 1st

petitioner at the relevant time) of the de facto complainant

who is living separately. Now, according to the petitioners,

the matter is settled as per Annexure-A3 agreement.

Annexure-A5 is the affidavit sworn into by the de facto

complainant.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.3152 of 2013
                             :-3-:


complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A5 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 451,

294(b), 506(1), 427 & 323 read with Section 149 of I.P.C.

which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

Crl.M.C.No.3152 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

Crl.M.C.No.3152 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

                             :-6-:


the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures-A1     &    A2  in    Crime   No.609  of 2011   of

Chadayamangalam Police Station and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.701 of 2011 on the

file  of  the   Judicial  First    Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kottarakkara.

                           Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 9th day of April, 2014


                                      O R D E R




           This Criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in C.C.No.180/2011 on

the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kozhikode, to

quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code

(hereinafter called the `Code').

           2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.355/2011 of

Panniyankara Police Station of Kozhikode District, which

was registered on the basis of the statement given by the

2nd respondent/defacto-complainant against the petitioner,

alleging offences under Section 341, 323, 294(b) and 392 of

the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was

filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.180/2011 and

pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Kozhikode. In the meantime, the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
                                   2

between the petitioner and the defacto-complainant due to

the intervention of mediators, as they were neighbours and

their relationship has been restored. Since, some of the

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

file the application before the court below to record

compounding and no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case as well because of the settlement. He has no

other remedy, except to approach this court, seeking the

following relief:

              "For the reasons stated above, it is respectfully
        prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to pass an
        order quashing Annexure-A1 FIR, Annexure-A2 charge in
        Crime No.355/2011 of Panniyankara Police Station and
        CC.No.180/2011 of CJM Court, Kozhikode, for the
        interest of justice."

             3.     2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties due to the intervention of friends and relatives

and they are neighbours and their relationship has been

restored and he does not want to prosecute the case. He

had filed Annexure-A3 affidavit showing these aspects. The

Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
                                   3

counsel for the petitioner also submitted that, in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and he

prayed for allowing the application.

             4.     Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

pending against the petitioner, but the petitioner was

absconding and he had not appeared the court below at all

and opposed the application.

             5.     It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Annexure-A1 first

information report was registered as Crime No.355/2011 of

Panniyankara Police Station, against the petitioner, alleging

offences under Sections 341, 323, 294(b) and 392 of the

Indian Penal Code and after investigation final report was

filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.180/2011 and now

pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Kozhikode. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties. It is seen from the affidavit that, the parties are

Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
                                       4

neighbours and due to the intervention of mediators, the

entire difference of opinion between them has been

resolved and he had decided not to proceed against the

petitioner on account of the settlement.                 So, even if the

matter is allowed to continue, there is no possibility of

conviction on account of the settlement and the relationship

between the neighbours has been restored as well. It is a

dispute between the neighbours and cannot be said to be an

incident of public interest, though Section 392 of the Indian

Penal Code was incorporated.

             6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and

Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
                                       5

      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the matter has

been settled between the parties and on account of the

Crl.M.C. No.2057 of 2014
                                  6

settlement, the relationship between the neighbours have

been restored and there is no possibility of conviction on

account of the same, this court feels that, it is a fit case

where the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to

promote the settlement.        So the petition is allowed and

further       proceedings     in     C.C.No.180/2011         (Crime

No.355/2011 of Panniyankara Police Station) pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kozhikode as

against the petitioner is quashed. Office is directed to

communicate this order to the concerned court, for

necessary further action.

              ============================
                     B.A. No.8947 of 2014
             =============================
            Dated this the 27th day of January, 2015

                           O R D E R

     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1340 of 2014

of the Mundakayam Police Station, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A IPC.

     3.    The petitioner married the defacto complainant on

18.10.2000. It is alleged that the had tortured and harassed

the defacto complainant by demanding more dowry. Finally,

she had to approach the court, through an application under

Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic

Violence Act and obtained protection. While the order was in

force and the proceedings were pending, the petitioner

approached her for a re-union and she was made to withdraw

from the proceedings under the Protection of Women from

Domestic Violence Act and she was taken to his house. It is

alleged that on 08.12.2014 at 7 p.m., she was severely

beaten up and fisted, thereby she had to be hospitalized.

B.A. No.8947 of 2014            2




      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   Even though there was an allegation that she has

become injured, a perusal of the wound certificate shows that

there were no external injuries at all. Considering the possible

chance of re-union and settlement in the matter and being a

matrimonial offence, I am of the view that this is a fit case

wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his executing

a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only)

with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to the

following terms and conditions:-

           (i)    The petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

B.A. No.8947 of 2014              3




     11.00       a.m.  on    all   Tuesdays      and    Fridays

     commencing from 03.02.2015 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.

            (ii)   The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The   petitioner    shall     make    himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

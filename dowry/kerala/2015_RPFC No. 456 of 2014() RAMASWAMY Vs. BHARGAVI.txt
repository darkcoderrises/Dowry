                      R.P.(F.C). No.456 OF 2014
                  ==========================

                 Dated this the 23rd day of January, 2015


                              JUDGMENT

      This revision petition is directed against order dated 19.10.2011

in M.C.No.200 of 2009 of the Family Court, Palakkad.                 The

revisionist-husband was the respondent in the said M.C filed by the

respondent-wife claiming maintenance. The respondent herself got

examined as PW1 and the revision petitioner herein was examined as

CPW1 in the said proceedings. On the side of the counter petitioner

Exts.D1 to D2(c) were marked. On appreciation of evidence, the

Family Court found that the petitioner is liable to maintain the

respondent herein and taking into account his capacity and ability, the

Family directed the revision petitioner to pay maintenance @ `1500

from the date of filing of the petition. It is challenging the said order

that this revision petition has been filed.

R.P.(FC).456/14                      2



      2.     I have heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner

and the learned counsel for the respondent. The main contention of

the revision petitioner is that he is 70% disabled and therefore,

incapable of doing any hard work and he is actually depending upon

his mother for livelihood. It is also contended that his mother is a

maid servant. To substantiate the contention that he is disabled, the

petitioner has produced Annexure A (Ext.D1) which is an attested

copy of the national identity card and pass book for disability

certificate issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu.        It is recorded

in the certificate that the revision petitioner is having 70% disability.

It is contended that the Family Court had failed to appreciate the

evidence adduced by the revision petitioner that he is incapable of

doing any hard work. In paragraph 10 of the impugned order, the

Family Court had considered the contentions raised by the revision

petitioner based on Ext.D1. The revision petitioner herein produced

Ext.D2 series of paragraphs to show that he is living in a hut. The

Family Court took note of the fact that during cross examination the

R.P.(FC).456/14                      3



revision petitioner admitted that he applied and obtained certificate

after the respondent wife filed a case alleging cruelty demanding

dowry. It is also to be noted that he himself admitted during cross

examination that he is a coolie. Evidently, the Family Court took note

of the disability of the revision petitioner and found that owing to his

disability on one hand there would be some shortage of his earning

capacity. Taking into account all the attending circumstances, the

Family Court arrived at the conclusion that the revision petitioner is

earning a monthly income of `5000. However, it is only apposite to

look into the precise case of the revision petitioner in this context. In

other words, going by the very case of the revision petitioner, his

mother is maintaining herself by working as a maid servant and it was

also his case that he is being looked after by his mother. In such

circumstances, it cannot be said that as on today he has to maintain his

mother from out of his income. Still, it is to be noticed that while

fixing the quantum of maintenance, the Family Court held that he has

to look after his mother also. After considering all such circumstances

R.P.(FC).456/14                      4



including the ability and capacity of the revision petitioner to earn, the

Family Court directed him to pay monthly maintenance of `1500 to

the respondent. A scanning of the evidence would reveal that he had

not disputed the fact that the respondent is his legally wedded wife

and also that she is living separately. He himself admitted the fact that

she had earlier filed a petition alleging cruelty based on demand of

dowry against him. In such circumstances, it could not be said that

she is living separately without any valid reason. In such

circumstances, I find no reason to interfere with the conclusion

arrived at by the Family Court that the revision petitioner is liable to

maintain the respondent. As regards the amount fixed towards the

maintenance, I have already taken note of the fact that the Family

Court fixed that amount after taking into account the physical

disability of the petitioner and also the shortage of his earning

capacity. The revision petitioner himself admitted the fact that he is a

coolie and that he is deriving a daily wage of 100 to 120.

Considering all the said circumstances, I do not find any reason to

R.P.(FC).456/14                     5



hold that the amount fixed by the Family Court towards maintenance

is exorbitant warranting interference by this Court exercising

revisional jurisdiction.   This revision petition is liable to fail.

However, the revision petitioner is granted six months time to pay the

arrears of maintenance and as such, the execution of the order in the

M.C shall be kept in abeyance for a period of six months to enable

him to pay the same.

      Subject to the above, this revision petition is dismissed.

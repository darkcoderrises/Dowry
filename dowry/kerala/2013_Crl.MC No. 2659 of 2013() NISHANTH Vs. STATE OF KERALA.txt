             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 1st day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused in S.C.No.1023 of 2010 of the

Additional Sessions Judge(Fast Track-II(ADHOC), Alappuzha

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No.46 of 2010 of Veeyapuram Police Station] for the offences

punishable under Sections.366 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash all further proceedings pertaining to 1st accused in

Annexure-I final report in Crime No.46 of 2010 of the

Veeyapuram     police  station   which    is  now    pending as

S.C.No.1023 of 2010 of the Additional Sessions Judge(Fast

Track-II(ADHOC), Alappuzha against the petitioner and all

further proceedings thereto as the matter is settled out of

court.

        2.    The allegation in the above case is that the

daughter of the de facto complainant who was a minor was

kidnapped on 22.02.2010 and on the basis of the information

furnished in the Veeyapuram police station, Crime No.46 of

2010 was registered for the offences punishable            under

Crl.M.C.No.2659 of 2013         2

Sections 366 and 34 of Indian Penal Code. According to the

petitioner, himself and the third respondent who is the

daughter of the de facto complainant/the second respondent

were in love and as the de facto complainant was originally not

in favour of the love affairs she prepared the above complaint.

Now the case of the petitioner is that he had married the third

respondent on 07.02.2011 with the permission of both the

families and now they are residing together. Annexure-2 is

the marriage certificate     and   Annexure-3    series are the

affidavit sworn into by the de facto complainant the second

respondent and the third respondent who is the victim and as

such, the case of the petitioners are that the matter is settled

out of court.

           3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents two and three. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

           4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

Crl.M.C.No.2659 of 2013          3

process of law and proceedings.

           5. The learned counsel for the respondents two and

three who on the basis of specific instruction received from

the second respondent submitted that the above respondents,

who are the de facto complainant/victim/injured do not intend

to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have

no grievance against him.

           6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-2 marriage certificate and Annexure-3(series) are

the affidavit filed by the respondents two and three. In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

           7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 366 r/w 34 of I.P.C which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

Crl.M.C.No.2659 of 2013             4

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me

that the injured/the victim/the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners accused in the light of

the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                  "57. The position that emerges from
           the above discussion can be summarised
           thus:      the power of the High Court in
           quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
           complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
           power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of
           the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the
           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
           abuse of the process of any Court. In what
           cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim
           have settled their dispute would depend on
           the facts and circumstances of each case
           and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.2659 of 2013            5

           "......... But the criminal cases having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
           flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes     of   quashing, particularly the
           offences arising from commercial, financial,
           mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the
           parties have resolved their entire dispute.
           In this category of cases, High Court may
           quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the
           offender and victim, the possibility of
           conviction      is remote   and   bleak  and
           continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to
           him by not quashing the criminal case
           despite     full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

Crl.M.C.No.2659 of 2013        6

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I final report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.1023 of 2010 of the

Additional Sessions Judge(Fast Track-II(ADHOC), Alappuzha

and all further proceedings thereto.

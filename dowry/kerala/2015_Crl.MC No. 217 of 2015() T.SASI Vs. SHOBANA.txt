            Dated this the 20th day of January, 2015

                                O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.537/2014 of

Town North Police Station, Palakkad registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

      3.   Petitioner has come up with this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 final report in

Crime No.537/2014 of Town North Police Station, Palakkad

as against the petitioner and all further proceedings based

on it in C.C.103/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Palakkad, quashed.

      4.   The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Crl.M.C.217/2015             : 2 :




Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto  complainant,    who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, that she has no complaints against the

petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings in the

matter referred to above can be quashed. She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for

Crl.M.C.217/2015                : 3 :




the defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the

affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on

her own volition.

      8.     Through a settlement the petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioner, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.537/2014 of Town North Police

Station, Palakkad as against the petitioner and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.103/2014 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Palakkad are hereby

quashed.

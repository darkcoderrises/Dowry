                Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 1st day of October, 2014.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in Crime

No.530 of 2014 of Thamarassery Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 294(b),

448 and 354 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in the

above crime, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that, the 1st

petitioner herein, who is a contractor by profession, has

completed construction of a house for the 2nd respondent/de

facto complainant and it is alleged that on 18.7.2014 at

about 6 p.m., when the 2nd respondent/de facto complainant

was away from his home, the 1st accused and others came

to 2nd respondent's house to see him and after his arrival,

Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                               2

the 1st petitioner demanded the amount of Rs.1 lakh which

was lying as balance towards the consideration for having

constructed the house belonging to the de facto complainant

and at that time, the de facto complainant pointed out the

faulty workmanship of the construction and the damage

thereby caused to the house and he pointed out the leaking

portions and asked him to rectify the same, but still when

the petitioner asked for the balance amount due to him,

there was a scuffle and on seeing this, the wife of the de

facto complainant came to the premises and tried to

intervene in the matter and the petitioners and others

thereupon assaulted her also and thereby committed the

offences as alleged by the prosecution. Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as respondent nos.2 and 3.         I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                               3

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, which is

the subject matter of the above case, as per Annexure-2

affidavit sworn into by respondent nos.2 and 3. Therefore,

the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for respondent nos.2 and 3,

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who are

the de facto complainant and injured respectively, do not

intends to proceed any further against the petitioners and

they have no grievance against the petitioners.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                                    4

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323,

324, 294(b), 448 and 354 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for respondent nos.2 and 3, it appears

to me that the de facto complainant and the injured have no

further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                                    5

         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.       In
         what      cases power   to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding     or complaint   or  F.I.R.  may    be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases    having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,      financial,   mercandile,     civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused
         to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

Crl.M.C.No.5148 of 2014
                                6

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.           Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

Crime No.530 of 2014 of Thamarassery Police Station.

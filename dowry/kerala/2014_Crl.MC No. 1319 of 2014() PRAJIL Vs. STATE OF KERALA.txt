                 Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
               ---------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 27th March, 2014

                          O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos. 1 to 5 in Crime No. 1811/2013 of Kannur Town

Police Station to quash the proceedings in view of the settlement

under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are arrayed

as accused Nos. 1 to 5 in the above                 case. The above case was

registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the 2nd respondent

before the District Police Chief, Kannur, which was forwarded to

the Town Police Station and the Town police had registered a

case as Crime No. 1811/2013 against the petitioners alleging

offences under Sections 143, 144, 148, 341, 324, 506(ii) and

395 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and Section

3(1) X of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention

of Atrocities) Act. The investigation is in progress.

     3. In the meantime, petitioners and de facto complainant

have   settled the issue and the                de facto        complaint has no

grievance against the petitioners                and he         does not want to

Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
                                 2

prosecute the case as well. Since it is in the investigation stage

and some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature

neither the police nor the court will drop      the proceedings at

this stage. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case as well. So they have no option

except to approach this Court seeking the following reliefs:

                 "For these and other grounds to be urged

                 at the time of hearing it is humbly prayed

                 that this Honourable Court may be pleased

                 to quash Annexure A1 F.I.R. No. 1811/2013

                 dated 03.12.2013,    registered by Kannur

                 Town Police, pending before the Hon'b le

                 Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I,

                 Kannur and allow           this    Criminal

                 Miscellaneous Case".

      4.    The 2nd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he does not want to proceed with the case and he had filed

Annexure A2 affidavit to that effect as well.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case.

Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
                                  3

      6. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor, on

instructions, as     directed by this Court, submitted that though

there is no other case against the petitioners, their enquiry

revealed that     the consent for withdrawal of the case has been

obtained by force and the affidavit was filed by the de facto

complainant is not out of free will and opposed the application.

      7. In view of such       submissions made by the learned

Public Prosecutor, this Court directed the 2nd respondent to

appear in person and he was thoroughly questioned          by this

Court to ascertain as to whether the consent given was free

and voluntary and he had really settled the dispute            and

relationship has been restored between them and he had stated

that the matter has been settled due to the intervention of

wellwishers of        both     the parties and he had filed an

affidavit voluntarily without any threat or compulsion from any

quarters and he does not want to proceed with the case and he

has no grievance against the petitioners.

      8.   It is an admitted fact that      the present case was

registered on the basis of a written complaint given by the de

facto complainant, the 2nd respondent herein before the District

Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
                                4

Police Chief against the petitioners alleging commission of the

above said offences which was forwarded to the Town Police

Station through proper channel and the crime was registered.

The investigation is in progress now. In the meantime, the

parties have settled the dispute and the de facto complainant

does not want to proceed with the case.    The interaction with

the de facto complainant by this Court revealed that the

settlement     was free and voluntary and it was not done under

any compulsion as submitted by the Public Prosecutor. It is true

that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act has been enacted to prevent atrocities being

committed against some community people mentioned in the Act

and who have not developed to the extent as other community

people are and also to prevent exploitation of those people on

the basis of their castes.

      9. Now the victim himself has come before this Court and

submitted that the matter has been settled          due to the

intervention of mediators and wellwishers    and the relationship

between the petitioners and the de facto complainant has been

restored and he is living in harmony with those people.

                                   5

      10. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a
      criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code.         Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
      such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
      to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
      cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
      complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
      offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
      and no category can be prescribed. However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due
      regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
      Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be
      fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's
      family and the offender have settled the dispute.
      Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the
      offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide    for   any   basis   for    quashing   criminal
      proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
      cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
      of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or

Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
                                   6

      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
      disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court
      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim,
      the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
      case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High
      Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
      of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
      end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      11. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and the victim himself has appeared before

this Court and submitted that the matter has been settled and

he does not want to proceed           against the    petitioners as

friendship and harmony has been restored on account of the

settlement and no possibility of conviction being entered into

against the petitioners. In view of this fact proceeding the

Crl.M.C. No. 1319 of 2014-F
                                 7

case    will be of no use as neither the complainant     nor his

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution.

      12. So under the circumstances, this Court feels that this

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to promote harmony that

has been restored between two community people which was

the intention of the legislature enacting the above enactment.

      Hence the application is allowed and further proceedings

in Crime No. 1811/ 2013 of Kannur Town Police Station as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court - I, Kannur so as to inform the

concerned police station     for necessary further action in this

regard.

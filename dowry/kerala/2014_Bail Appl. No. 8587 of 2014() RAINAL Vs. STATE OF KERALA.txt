     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1475 of

2014 of the Koothattukulam Police Station, registered for

the offence punishable under Section 498 A IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

had tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

his wife, and had treated her with cruelty by demanding

more dowry and gold ornaments after misappropriating her

entire gold ornaments and money.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     5. The contents of the CD reveal that the investigation

of this case is practically over. No criminal antecedents

have been reported against the petitioner. Considering the

facts and circumstances of the case and the fact that this is

                                : 2 :



a matrimonial offence, I am of the view that this is a fit case

wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

     6.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

           (i) The petitioner shall report before the

    investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

    on all Tuesdays and Fridays, commencing from

    16.12.2014 for a period of three months or till the

    filing of the final report in this case, whichever is

    earlier.

           (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the

    evidence or influence witnesses.

           (iii) The   petitioner    shall make     himself

     the Investigating Officer.

           (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

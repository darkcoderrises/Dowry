                Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 1st day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in Crime

No.105 of 2014 of Vakathanam Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 447, 294(b), 506(1),

386 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1

FIR   and   further   proceedings       pending  against the

petitioners in the above crime, as the matter is settled out

of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

12.2.2014 at about 6.15 a.m., while one Sabu was

removing soil from the property of the de facto

complainant using a JCB, the accused persons with an

intention to exhort money from the de facto complainant

Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                               2

trespassed into the property of the de facto complainant

and intimidated her and her son using abusive language

and threatened by the act of the accused persons, she gave

an amount of Rs.2,000/- to them and as such, the

petitioners have committed the offences as alleged by the

prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                               3

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance

against them.

         6.    I    have carefully considered  the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 447,

294(b), 506(1), 386 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                                    4

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly     and     pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the

Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                                   5

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According       to    me,  in    the   light   of    the  facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case.         According to me, as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of

Crl.M.C.No.4245 of 2014
                               6

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decision

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A1 FIR in Crime No.105 of 2014 of Vakathanam

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in the above crime.

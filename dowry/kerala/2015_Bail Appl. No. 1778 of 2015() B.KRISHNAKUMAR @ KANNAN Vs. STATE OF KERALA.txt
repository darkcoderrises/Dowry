              Bail Appl. No.1778 of 2015
           --------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 26th day of May 2015

                          O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

          2. Petitioner apprehends that he will be

arrested by the Police on the accusation that he has

committed the offence under Sec.498A of Indian Penal

Code. The first informant is his wife. He allegedly

subjected her to cruelty demanding more dowry.

          3. Heard both sides.

          4. The prosecution has no case that the first

informant sustained any serious injuries. Since this is a

family matter, the possibility of the parties making a

reconciliation cannot be ruled out. The parties are aged

about 50 years.

          5. Having regard to these facts, I am inclined to

grant the prayer in this application.

          In the result, this bail application is allowed:

         1)    The petitioner shall be released on bail

    after interrogation on his executing a bond for

    25,000/- (Twenty five thousand only) with two

Bail Appl. No.1778 of 2015  2

     solvent sureties each for the like sum if he is

     arrested by the Police in connection with this

     case.

           2) He shall appear before the Investigating

     Officer for interrogation if he is so required by

     him in writing.

           3) He shall not destroy or tamper with

     evidence.

           4)  He     shall not  harass   the    defacto

     complainant or her relatives.

     In case of violation of any of the above conditions,

the learned Magistrate is empowered to cancel the bail in

accordance with the law.

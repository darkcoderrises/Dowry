                            ---------------

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners are A2 and A3 in Crime No.70/2014 of

Mahila Thana Police Station, Madhya Pradesh, registered

for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 506

read with Section 34 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry

Prohibition Act.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused and treated her with cruelty by

demanding    more     dowry       and      gold     ornaments, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD.

     5. The investigation of this case is practically over.

Mahila Thana Police has made it clear that they have no

                                 : 2 :


intention to arrest the petitioners in connection with the

present crime. The main overt acts are alleged against the

1st accused. The petitioners are the aged parents of the 1st

accused. Considering all the above, I am of the view that

this is a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to

the petitioners.

      6.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on

each of them executing a bond for 25,000/- (Rupees

twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for

the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting

arrest, and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

             (i)   The petitioners shall not tamper with

      the evidence or influence witnesses.

             (ii)  The petitioners shall make themselves

      available for interrogation as and when required

      by the investigating officer.

             (iii) The petitioners shall not involve in any

                                : 3 :


      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

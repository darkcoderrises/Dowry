                  B.A.No.5620 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 1st day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       Apprehending arrest, the first accused in Crime

No.695/14 of Hosdurg Police Station preferred this

application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. for anticipatory

bail.

     2. The sum and substance of the offence alleged is

that from 6.8.2006 till January 2014, the accused

misappropriated gold ornaments and cash of the de facto

complainant, gave hand blows on her, and physically and

mentally harassed the de facto complainant, demanding

more dowry and ornaments. Accordingly, they have

committed the offences punishable under sections 323, 406

and 498A r/w section 34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A.No.5620 of 2014
                               2

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

the present crime is registered only to harass the petitioner

and his parents, since the matter was settled earlier in the

Lok    Adalat      organised by  the  Taluk   Legal    Services

Committee, Hosdurg. It is also the submission of the learned

counsel for the petitioner that the parents of the petitioner

were released on bail by the Sessions court, Kasaragod, as

per Annexure A1 order.       In the absence of any overtact

alleged against the petitioner, according to the learned

counsel, the petitioner is entitled to get the relief as sought

for. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the

allegation against the petitioner and other accused are

general in nature and particularly one of the allegations is

that the petitioner had misappropriated the gold ornaments.

The overtact alleged against the petitioner is to the effect

that he had slapped on the cheek of the de facto

complainant.

      5. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the

case, I am of the view that, custodial interrogation of the

B.A.No.5620 of 2014
                                 3

petitioner is not necessary and therefore this petition can be

allowed, however, subject to strict conditions, so as to

secure the interest of the prosecution.

      In the result, this petition is allowed and there will be a

direction that in the event of arrest of the petitioner in Crime

No.695/14 of Hosdurg Police Station, he shall be released on

bail, on his executing a bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent

sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the

Investigating Officer in the above crime and on the following

other conditions :

             1.    The petitioner shall report before the
             Investigating Officer in the above crime at 11 a.m.
             on Sundays once in a fortnight.

             2.    The petitioner shall co-operate with the
             investigation and he shall not influence the
             witnesses or tamper the evidence.

                                                    Sd/-

                            V.K.MOHANAN, J
                   ===========================
                         Crl.M.C No.4604 of 2014
                   ============================
                Dated this the 18th day of September,2014

                                  ORDER


      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners, who

are accused Nos.1 to 19 in C.C.No.47/2013 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Changanacherry, which is a case instituted upon the police

report in Crime No.1920/2012 of Changanacherry Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 323, 354 and 427 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 charge sheet and further

proceedings against the petitioners in C.C No.47/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Changanacherry arising out of Crime

No. 1920/2012 of Changanacherry Police Station as the matter is settled out

of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 17.10.2012 at about

10:15 p.m the petitioners due to the previous enmity towards the third

respondent who is the husband of the second respondent formed themselves

into an unlawful assembly and came to the house of the second respondent

Crl.M.C No.4604 of 2014
                                      2

in two cars and a lorry and thereafter trespassed into her house and

assaulted her and attacked two mentally retarded brothers of her husband

and they sustained injuries in the attack. It is further alleged that the second

respondent lost her gold chain weighing 3 sovereigns and she sustained a

loss of Rs.50,000/- and thus, the petitioners have committed the aforesaid

offences and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out

of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the 2nd

and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, who on the basis

of specific instruction received from the respondents, submitted that the above

respondents does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

they have no grievance against them.

Crl.M.C No.4604 of 2014
                                          3

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case, it

can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are under Sections 143,

147, 148, 452, 323, 354 and 427 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 2nd and 3rd     respondents, it appears to me that they have no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can
          be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
          Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

Crl.M.C No.4604 of 2014
                                             4

           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
           power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of
           the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
           facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
           prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
           of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
           financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or
           the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
           nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
           its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim,
           the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
           criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
           with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present case,

the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I

am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

Crl.M.C No.4604 of 2014
                                      5

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -A1 charge

sheet    and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.47/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Changanacherry in

Crime No. 1920/2012 of Changanacherry Police Station.

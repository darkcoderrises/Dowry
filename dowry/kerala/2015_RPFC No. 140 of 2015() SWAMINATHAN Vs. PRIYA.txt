                R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015
     ------------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 21st day of May, 2015

                           ORDER

     The revision petitioner is the husband of the 1st

respondent as well as father of the 2nd and 3rd

respondents.      The     legality     of    entitlement    of

maintenance allowance and quantum of maintenance

allowance    determined       by    the    court     below  in

M.C.No.374 of 2011 are under challenge in this

revision petition. According to the 1st respondent, her

marriage with the petitioner was solemnized on

7/5/2000 and they lived together and the respondents

2 and 3 are the children born out of the said wed-lock.

But the petitioner had neglected to maintain them by

refusing   to   pay    maintenance       allowance      to the

respondents. According to the respondents, the

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015        -: 2 :-

petitioner    was having suspicious mind and he

suspected her chastity       and on that account, he

harassed her mentally and physically.        So also, he

demanded dowry.         When the harassment became

intolerable, she was constrained to file a complaint

before the police which culminated in a prosecution

against the petitioner before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Chittur.     The petitioner is a toddy

tapper at Govindapuram and earning `500/- per day.

He is also also having agricultural land of 1.20 Acres

and is getting `35,000/- per year; whereas the 1st

respondent has no job or income and she is unable to

maintain herself and the respondents 2 and 3.         The

respondents claimed `3,000/- per month to the 1st

respondent and `2,500/- each per month to the 2nd

and 3rd respondents.

      2. Per contra, the petitioner denied the allegation

that he neglected the respondents and refused to pay

maintenance allowance to them.         He further denied

that he is getting `500/- per day from tapping and

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015       -: 3 :-

getting `35,000/- per year from the agricultural

property. It is also contended that the 1st respondent

is getting `15,000/- per month as her share from the

hotel owned by her father. She is also getting `8,000/-

per month from tailoring.      The petitioner is getting

`150/- per day as a toddy tapper and the said work is

a   seasonal     work   for four     months  only.  After

considering the rival pleas, the court below directed

the petitioner to pay maintenance allowance at the

rate of `2,500/- per month to the 1st respondent,

`2,000/- to the 2nd respondent and `1,500/- to the 3rd

respondent.

      3.  The     learned  counsel     for the petitioner

advanced arguments challenging the finding by which

the court below directed the revision petitioner to pay

maintenance       allowance  as     referred above.  The

learned counsel for the petitioner pointed out that the

court below failed to consider the admission of the 1st

respondent that she has income as a sharer of the

hotel business of his father. In view of the admission

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015      -: 4 :-

made by the 1st respondent, she is not entitled to get

maintenance allowance from the petitioner.      It is also

contended that though the petitioner is a toddy

tapper, the toddy tapping is a seasonal employment

for four months only. In that view of the matter, the

quantum of maintenance allowance determined by the

court below is excessive and disproportionate with his

income.

      4. Going by the impugned judgment, it is the

specific case of the respondents that the revision

petitioner has neglected the respondents and refused

to pay maintenance allowance to them.        The revision

petitioner has no case that he has been maintaining

his wife and children in accordance with their day-to-

day requirements. No evidence had been adduced to

controvert the allegation that he refused to pay

maintenance allowance to them.        In that view of the

matter, there is no reason to interfere with the finding

of the court below that the respondents are entitled to

get   maintenance      allowance    from   the   revision

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015        -: 5 :-

petitioner.

      5. It is the case of the revision petitioner that

since the 1st respondent herself admitted that she is

having share in the hotel business, she is not entitled

to get any amount as maintenance allowance from the

revision petitioner. I am unable to accept the

argument advanced by the learned counsel for the

revision    petitioner   in  view     of  the proposition

contemplated under Sec.125 of the Cr.P.C.            The

question to be considered under Sec.125 of the Cr.P.C.

is not whether the wife has income or not.           The

question to be considered is whether the wife is able

enough to maintain herself? As rightly noted by the

court below, the above admission does not mean that

she is regularly      getting sufficient income from the

hotel business in order to meet the respondents'

entire day-to-day expenses.           Even though she is

getting any income from the hotel business, though

the said claim is not proved by adducing evidence, the

same can be considered only in the determination of

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015       -: 6 :-

the quantum of maintenance only and maintenance

cannot be denied on the basis of that admission,

unless it is proved by the petitioner that income from

the hotel is sufficient enough to maintain herself and

the children. But, here there is no such evidence.     In

Chaturbhuj v. Sita Bai     [2008 (1) KLT 41 (SC)], the

Apex Court held that the words 'unable to maintain

herself' mean that means available to the deserted

wife while she was living with the husband and would

not take within itself the efforts made by the wife after

desertion to survive somehow. The revision petitioner

has no case that the 1st respondent was getting

income from the hotel business while she was living

along with the petitioner. Therefore, income which is

said to have been derived from the hotel business of

his father cannot be taken into account so as to deny

the claim of maintenance.       In the above view of the

matter, the contention raised by the learned counsel

for the revision petitioner will stand rejected.

      6. Coming to the quantum of maintenance

R.P.(FC) No.140 of 2015         -: 7 :-

allowance. The husband is liable to give maintenance

in accordance with the standard of life to which his

wife and children are accustomed.         The respondents

2 and 3 are school going students and the word

'maintenance' does not signify only the provision for

food; but also the provision for clothing, residence,

education, medical attendance etc.          In that view of

the matter, I find that the quantum of maintenance

allowance determined by the court below is just and

proper and warranting no interference under            the

revisional jurisdiction.

      Accordingly, this revision petition will stand

dismissed.

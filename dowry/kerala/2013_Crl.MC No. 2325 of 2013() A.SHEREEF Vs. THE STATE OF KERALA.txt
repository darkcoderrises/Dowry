               ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.2325 of 2013
               ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in L.P.C.No.62 of 2012 in

C.C.No.675 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod which is a case instituted upon

the police report in Crime No.90 of 2009 of Adhur Police

Station for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,

148, 341, 323 & 324 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash Annexure-A2 final report and all further

proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.90 of 2009 of Adhur

Police Station which is now pending as L.P.C.No.62 of 2012 in

C.C.No.675 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod as the matter is settled out of

court.

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                                 :-2-:

      2.     The allegation in the above case is that on 17/4/2009

at 2 pm. the accused who are IUML activists because of their

political enmity towards the de facto complainant formed

themselves into an unlawful assembly with weapons such as

stick, wrongfully restrained the 2nd respondent and assaulted

him at Ammangod in Muliyar Village, and now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

      3.     It is also relevant to note that out of the 6 accused 5

of them faced trial in C.C.No.462 of 2009 of the court of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod and they are

acquitted as per Annexure-A3 judgment. In the said judgment

the learned Magistrate has found that all the prosecution

witnesses including PW.1 did not witness the incident and

accordingly there are no evidence to fallen the accused with

any criminal liability.`

      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the second respondent.           I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                              :-3-:

         5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings. The learned counsel for the

second respondent who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondent submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioner and he has no

grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition which is

marked as Annexure-A5 affidavit.        In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                                      :-4-:

above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

323 & 324 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                                              :-5-:

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                                            :-6-:

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. I

am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

Crl.M.C.No.2325/2013

                             :-7-:

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings      pending against    the petitioner in

Annexure-A2 final report and all further proceedings in

L.P.C.No.62 of 2012 in C.C.No.675 of 2010 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod.

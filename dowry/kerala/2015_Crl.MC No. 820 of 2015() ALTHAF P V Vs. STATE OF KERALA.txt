                         Crl.M.C. 820 of 2015
            ..............................................................
          Dated this the 25th day of February, 2015.


                            O R D E R




     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.652 of 2014 of

Hosdurg Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 323,498(A) read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.

           2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1-FIR                            in Crime

No.652 of 2014 of the Hosdurg Police Station and all further

proceedings against the petitioners in the said crime, pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg,

quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

Crl.M.C. 820 of 2015            2

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints     against the   petitioners    and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.   The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed. She has entered appearance

through her counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto

complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been

sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

Crl.M.C. 820 of 2015              3

     7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1-FIR

in Crime No.652 of 2014 of the Hosdurg Police Station and all

further proceedings against the petitioners in the said crime,

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,

Hosdurg, are hereby quashed.

                      Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011

                   ---------------------------------------

                Dated this 14th day of March, 2011

                                 ORDER

      Respondent, the former husband faced a demand for

certain payments in M.C.No.5 of 2007 of the Court of Judicial

First Class Magistrate-I, Thamarassery under Sec.3 of the Muslim

Women Protection of Rights on Divorce Act, 1986 (for short, "the

Act"). It is not disputed that petitioner married the respondent on

14.12.2003 and effected a divorce on 10.08.2006. Respondent

claimed that of the 65 sovereigns of ornaments given to her,

petitioner misappropriated 60 sovereigns. She also claimed that

at the time of Nikah, her father gave her `.1,50,000/- as present

and later a further sum of Rs.10,000/- which were entrusted to

the petitioner but he misappropriated the same. She claimed that

petitioner is a Contractor earning Rs.20,000/- per month and

another `.10,000/- from his landed property. Respondent claimed

`.6,000/- as maintenance for the period of Iddat, `.3,00,000/-

towards reasonable and fair provision for future maintenance,

`.4,20,000/- being the value of 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments

and `.1,60,000/- the amount allegedly entrusted to the petitioner

and misappropriated by him. Petitioner denied the allegations

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                               -: 2 :-


and contended that respondent had only 30 sovereigns of

ornaments which is still with her. He claimed that he is working

as a helper in building works earning Rs.150/- per day. With the

meager income he has to maintain his family including his second

wife who are dependent on him. Before the learned Magistrate

respondent gave evidence as PW1 and examined her uncle as

PW2. She also proved Exts.P1 to P3. Petitioner gave contra

evidence as CPW1. Learned Magistrate found that her version

that she was given 65 sovereigns and out of that, 60 sovereigns

were misappropriated by the petitioner cannot be accepted even

taking into account Ext.P2, series bills and accordingly rejected

that claim. Learned Magistrate found from the evidence that

petitioner and respondent belonged to middle class family and

that petitioner is constructing a new building in a plot of land.

Evidence of PWs.1 and 2 regarding entrustment of `.1,60,000/- to

the petitioner on behalf of respondent was accepted. Petitioner

was directed to pay that amount. Learned Magistrate also found

that the claim for `.6,000 as expenses during the period of idaat

is reasonable and allowed that claim. `.1,50,000/- was allowed

towards reasonable and fair provision for future maintenance.

Thus total amount awarded by the learned Magistrate is

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                                -: 3 :-


`.3,16,000/-. Petitioner challenged that order in revision. Learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Kozhikode in Crl.R.P.No.27 of 2009

while confirming the finding entered by the learned Magistrate

held that for the purpose of fixing reasonable and fair provision

for future maintenance, monthly expenses can be fixed as

`.2,000/-   and     accordingly fixed   the   amount   payable   at

`.1,20,000/-. Thus, the total amount payable to the respondent

was found to be `.2,86,000/-. That order is under challenge.

Learned counsel for petitioner has contended that there is no

reliable evidence to show that `.160,000/- was entrusted to the

petitioner as claimed by the respondent. Evidence of PWs.1 and 2

in that regard cannot be reliable. It is also contended that at any

rate learned Magistrate having found that the sum of `.1,50,000/-

represented dowry which is prohibited under the provisions of

Dowry Prohibition Act and could not have been recovered by way

of a civil suit, should not have been allowed. It is further

contended that so far as the amount awarded as Iddat and

towards reasonable and fair provision of future maintenance is

concerned there is no evidence to show that petitioner is capable

of making such payment. Learned counsel placed reliance on the

decision in Arun Garg Vs. State of Punjab and Anr. (JT 2004

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                                -: 4 :-


(8) SC 124).

      2.    So far as acceptability of the evidence of PWs.1 and 2

regarding entrustment of `.1,60,000/- to the petitioner on behalf

of respondent is concerned, it has come in evidence that

petitioner and respondent are related and that respondent is

physically disabled. PW2 is related to the petitioner and

respondent and claimed to have been present at the time of

Nikah and witnessed payment of `.1,50,000/- to the petitioner.

He also claimed to have been present when `.10,000/- was given

to the petitioner on 25.01.2006. True, no documentary evidence

is produced by the respondent to prove the said payments. But,

learned Magistrate found that there is no reason to disbelieve the

evidence of PWs.1 and 2 and that has been confirmed by the

learned Additional Sessions Judge.

      3.    I must bear in mind that petitioner and respondent

are related. In such a situation and even otherwise, for payment

of amount by the father on behalf of the respondent to the

petitioner, one need not insist on documentary evidence. It is

quite unlikely that in such a situation for such payment the father

of the girl would obtain a document from the bride groom. This

has been taken note of in the decision in Muhammed Davood

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                               -: 5 :-


and Anr. Vs. Hafsath and Anr. (2009(4) KHC 853) where it

was held that so far as matrimonial disputes are concerned

Courts need not necessarily insist on documentary evidence. In

the case on hand evidence of PWs.1 and 2 and CPW1 have been

evaluated by the trial court and revisional court and those courts

concluded that there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of

PWs.1 and 2. I do not find reason to interfere with the said

finding exercising supervisory jurisdiction under Sec.482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, "the Code").

      4.    Then the next question is whether the sum of

`.1,60,000/- is recoverable on the plea raised by the petitioner. In

the decision relied by the learned counsel and referred supra, in

the last but one paragraph the Supreme Court considered the

question whether in considering the compenstation payable

under Sec.357(3) of the Code the amount of dowry paid could be

taken   into    account. The    Supreme    Court    observed   that

complainant could not have filed a civil suit for recovery of dowry

as that payment itself was illegal and prohibited under law. The

Supreme Court also observed that having regard to the

circumstances, the direction of the High Court for payment of

Rs.Two Lakh as fine was not warranted and accordingly that

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                                 -: 6 :-


direction was set aside.

      5.    The question is whether the said principle is

applicable to the facts of the case. It is true that in paragraph 21

of the order of the trial court it is observed that it has come out in

the evidence of PW1 that she is physically disabled and petitioner

who is her relative married her by obtaining "dowry of

`.1,50,000/-"at the time of Nikah. In paragraph 22 of the order

for the purpose of deciding whether such evidence of PWs.1 and

2 can be believed learned Magistrate observed that normally

'dowry' is being paid at the time of the marriage among members

of the Muslim community. Learned counsel submitted that the

above said finding in paragraph 21 of the order was not

challenged by the respondent in revision. But the mere fact that

the said observation is not challenged, so far as she is not

aggrieved by the ultimate order is no ground to accept

observations. I have gone through the copy of petition preferred

by the respondent before the learned Magistrate. There, in

paragraph 2 what is stated is that respondent was given

`.1,50,000/- as present at the time of marriage and that amount

was misappropriated by the petitioner. Petitioner, under the

pretext that it is required to purchase a property in the name of

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                                -: 7 :-


petitioner and respondent misappropriated it. It is further stated

that on 25.01.2006 respondent was given `.10,000/- from her

house which also was misappropriated by the petitioner. In other

words respondent has not proceeded on the basis that the said

payments were by way of dowry. In the light of the above, the

mere fact that learned Magistrate observed in paragraph 21 of

the order that evidence disclosed that `.1,50,000/- was given as

dowry is not by itself sufficient to hold that what was given to the

respondent was dowry, it was not recoverable by way of a civil

suit and hence learned Magistrate went wrong in awarding the

amount. Under Sec.3(d) of the Act all the properties given to

respondent before, at the time of marriage or after the marriage

by her relatives or friends or the husband or any relatives of the

husband or his friends are recoverable under sec.3 of the Act if

divorce is effected. Hence the decision relied by the learned

counsel has no application to the facts of the case.

      6.    What remained is whether the amount awarded as

Iddat and towards reasonable and fair provision and for future

maintenance are excessive. According to the respondent,

petitioner is a Contractor earning `.20,000/- per month. It is also

her version that he is earning `.10,000/- from landed properties.

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                               -: 8 :-


True, no documentary evidence was produced to show that

petitioner has landed property but he admitted that Ext.P3 is the

photograph of a building being constructed by him in his

property. He claimed that he had landed property but he sold the

same and he is now constructing a building at Puthupady. It is

not as if what the respondent stated is a total falsehood.

Petitioner had property but he did not produce documentary

evidence to show that it was sold. It is revealed from Ext.P3 and

the evidence of petitioner as CPW1 that he is constructing a new

building in the property belonging to him. Learned Magistrate

taking these circumstances into account and the fact that at any

rate petitioner is able bodied, is capable of earning and the very

fact that even after divorcing respondent he married again, held

that the circumstances indicated his financial capacity. Learned

Magistrate in the circumstances found that petitioner and

respondent belonged to reasonably well placed middle class

family .

      7.    The amount award as expenses during the period of

iddat is only `.2000/- which is just around `.65/- a day.

Respondent was aged 21years at the time of filing of the petition.

Having regard to her needs, expenses and escalation of prices I

Crl.M.C.No.788 of 2011
                                 -: 9 :-


am not inclined to think that `.65/- a day is a luxury for the

respondent. At that rate, `.6,000/- has been awarded as expenses

during the period of Iddat.

      8.    So far as future maintenance is concerned, learned

Magistrate fixed it as `.1,60,000/- but the learned Additional

Sessions Judge reduced it as `.1,20,000/-. I am not inclined to

think, at the instance of petitioner that interference is required.

      Criminal miscellaneous case fails. It is dismissed.

                ---------------------------
               Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014
             -------------------------------
       Dated this the 30th day of May, 2014

                         ORDER


     This is an application filed by the sole accused in

C.C.No.2064/2013 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kochi to quash the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

called as the 'Code')

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner

is arrayed as sole accused in Crime No. 169/2013 of

the Harbor Police Station) which was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the 2nd respondent as

de facto complainant alleging offences under Sections

323, and 341 of the Indian Penal Code.              After

investigation Annexure A final report was filed and it

was taken on file and pending as C.C.No.2064/2013

on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-I,   Kochi.   Now the matter has been settled

between the parties.     No purpose will be served on

Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014            2

account of the settlement. So the petitioner has no other

remedy except to approach this Court seeking the

following relief:

            to   quash   all   further  proceedings     in

      C.C.No.2064/2013(Crime No.169/2013 of the Harbor

      Police Station), on the file of Judicial First Class

      Magistrate Court No.I, Kochi.



      3. Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he does not want to prosecute the petitioner

and he had filed Annexure II affidavit stating these facts.

      4. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that

in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served in

keeping the case on file.

      5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instruction as

directed by this Court, submitted that except this case

there is no other case against the petitioner but opposed

the application.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant,       the  case     was   registered      as Crime

Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014           3

No.169/2013 of Harbor Police Station of Kochi City and

after investigation, Annexure A final report was filed and

it was taken on file and pending as C.C. No.2064/2013

on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kochi. The offences alleged are 323 and 341 of the Indian

Penal Code. The matter has been now settled between

the parties. Second respondent had filed Annexure II

affidavit stating that the matter has been settled and he

has no grievance against the petitioner and he does not

want to prosecute the case in view of the settlement

arrived between the parties. There is no public interest

involved and it appears to be a dispute between two

individuals which resulted in the case.            In view of the

settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case as conviction in such cases will be remote .

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus: the power of

        the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or

Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014              4

        F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent

        jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

        given to a criminal court for compounding the

        offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power

        is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

        it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

        engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of

        justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any

        Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised

        where the offender and victim have settled their

        dispute    would     depend    on    the   facts  and

        circumstances of each case and no category can be

        prescribed.      However, before exercise of such

        power, the High Court must have due regard to the

        nature and gravity of the crime.          Heinous and

        serious offences of mental depravity or offences like

        murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

        quashed even though the victim or victim's family

        and the offender have settled the dispute.       Such

        offences are not private in nature and have serious

        impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise

        between the victim and offender in relation to the

        offences under special statutes like Prevention of

        Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

        servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot

        provide    for   any   basis  for   quashing  criminal

        proceedings involving such offences.          But the

        criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

        dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

        for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014              5

        offences     arising  from    commercial,    financial,

        mercantile,    civil,    partnership   or   such   like

        transactions    or   the  offences   arising   out   of

        matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

        disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved

        their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

        Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

        because of the compromise between the offender

        and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

        and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

        put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

        extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

        quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

        settlement and compromise with the victim.           In

        other words, the High Court must consider whether

        it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

        justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or

        continuation of the criminal proceeding would

        tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

        settlement and compromise between the victim and

        wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of

        justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

        end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

        affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

        jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that matter is

settled between the parties and no conviction will be

Crl.M.C.No.2210 of 2014         6

possible in such cases and allowing the case to continue

in the file will amount to wastage of judicial time, this

Court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code can be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote settlement which resulted in

restoration of harmony between the parties.

         So   the    application is allowed   and   further

proceedings in C.C.No.2064/2013 (Crime No.169/2013 of

the Harbor Police Station) pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court -I, Kochi as against the petitioner

is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary further action

in this regard.

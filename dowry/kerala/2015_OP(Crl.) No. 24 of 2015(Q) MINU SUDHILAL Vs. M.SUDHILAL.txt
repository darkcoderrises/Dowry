                      O.P.(Crl) No.24 of 2015
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 2nd day of February, 2015

                             J U D G M E N T

      This is a petition filed under Article 227 of the

Constitution of India.

      2.   The petitioner has filed a private complaint before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-V, Kochi alleging

offences under Sections 498A, 323, 324, 294(B), 341, 506

(2), 511 of 309, 354, 509, 403, 406 and 420 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4

of Dowry Prohibition Act against respondents 1 to 5 herein.

The first respondent is none other than the husband of the

petitioner.   It seems that the first respondent is the Sub

Inspector of Police, Mattancherry. In fact, without taking note

of the said aspect, it seems that at first the learned

O.P.(Crl)24 of 2015
                               -: 2 :-



Magistrate has chosen to pass an order thereby referring

the matter to the Sub Inspector of Police, Mattancherry for

investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. After some time,

wisdom prevailed and the learned Magistrate perused the

files and he could notice that the person to whom the matter

was referred for investigation is the first accused in the

matter and therefore, immediately, the learned Magistrate

passed Ext.P2 order by deciding to record the sworn

statement of the petitioner, posting the case to 24.01.2015

for that purpose. The said order passed by the learned

Magistrate is under challenge herein.

       3.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel for the respondents.

       4.      The learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed

out that various illegalities have been committed by the

learned Magistrate. By omitting to take note of the fact that

the first accused in the complaint is the Sub Inspector of

Police, Mattancherry, the learned Magistrate had passed an

O.P.(Crl)24 of 2015
                                -: 3 :-



order directing the first respondent herein to conduct

investigation in the case under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.

According to the learned counsel for the respondents, the

Magistrate came to know that the first respondent is the Sub

Inspector of Police, Mattancherry and thereby the learned

Magistrate has chosen to recall the earlier order passed by

him and passed an order thereby deciding to record the

sworn statement of the petitioner. According to the learned

counsel for the petitioner, even when the first respondent is

the Sub Inspector of Police, Mattancherry, the learned

Magistrate could have forwarded the matter to some other

police officer for investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.

       5.      It seems that the learned Magistrate ought to

have passed an order thereby deciding to conduct an

inquiry by himself or through some other police officer within

the meaning of Section 202(1) Cr.P.C.            The learned

Magistrate is fully empowered to pass such an order. The

only illegality committed by the learned Magistrate is that he

O.P.(Crl)24 of 2015
                                   -: 4 :-



had recalled his earlier order and reviewed it, even though

there is no provision of law enabling the learned Magistrate

to do it. Whatever it is, the present order seems to be a

correct order and in this particular case when serious

allegations are there against a police officer, who is the Sub

Inspector of Police of that particular Police Station, the

learned Magistrate is empowered to conduct 202 inquiry

with the assistance of other police officers within the

meaning of Section 202(1) Cr.P.C. At the same time, when

such unpleasant circumstances are created by the court

below, this Court is of the view that the matter can be

transferred       to  another    learned    Judicial  First Class

Magistrate of the very same Station, to proceed with the

matter.

       6.      In the result, this O.P.(Crl) stands disposed of in

the following terms:

       The aforesaid matter in M.P.No.104/2015 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-V, Kochi is transferred

O.P.(Crl)24 of 2015
                            -: 5 :-



to the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kochi for

disposal, in accordance with law, in the light of the

observations made above. The petitioner shall appear

before the said Court on 18.02.2015.

                  --------------------------

                    Crl.M.C.No. 5560 of 2014

                  --------------------------

            Dated this the 1st day of October, 2014

                              O R D E R
            The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the accused in S.C. No. 677 of 2011 on the file

of the Addl. Sessions Court (Adhoc-II), Ernakulam        which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 687 of 2009 of

Palluruthy Police Station for an offence punishable under Section

376 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A2 final report

and all further proceedings pursuant there to in the above crime,

as the matter is settled out of court.

      2.   The allegation in the above case is that the accused by

promising to marry the de facto complainant has committed

rape on her on various occasions. But the accused did not marry

her, and now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

out of court.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014            2

the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the 2nd respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner           and   she  has  no  grievance    against    him.

         5. Both the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned counsel for the second respondent submitted that as the

dispute has been settled between the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent              and  pursuant to   such settlement         the

petitioner/accused married the de facto complainant                on

4-2-2013 and they are living together as husband and wife. So,

it is the submission of both the counsel          appearing for the

respective parties that if the criminal proceedings are continued

against the petitioner, it will adversely affect the smooth marital

life of the petitioner and the second respondent.

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014            3

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition. In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.         Hence,   I do endorse the submission of the learned

counsel for the petitioner as well as the second respondent. While

the petitioner and the second respondent are residing together

after their marriage, certainly, the continuation of the criminal

proceedings will create unnecessary harassment which             will

affect their smooth family life. As the petitioner married the

second respondent and particularly, in view of the stand of the

second respondent,           even if trial is proceeded  against the

petitioner, there would not be any fruitful outcome and the

same will be resulted in waste of time which would amount to

abuse           of         process  of    law     and    proceedings.

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014                  4

                  7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in

the above case is Sec. 376 IPC which is more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offence is                involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at by them.

              8.       In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                  "57.     The position that emerges from the above
                  discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
                  High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
                  or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014                5

                  distinct and different from the power given to a
                  criminal court for compounding the offences under
                  S.320 of the Code.        Inherent power is of wide
                  plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
                  exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
                  such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
                  to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
                  cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
                  complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
                  offender and victim have settled their dispute would
                  depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
                  and no category can be prescribed..


 It is further held as follows:-
                "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
                and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
                footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
                offences           arising       from       commercial,
                financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
                transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
                relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
                wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
                parties have resolved their entire dispute.      In this
                category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
                proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014           6

                between the offender and victim, the possibility of
                conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
                criminal case would put accused to great oppression
                and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
                to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
                and complete settlement and compromise with the
                victim........"

        9.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the

event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

Crl.M.C. No. 5560 of 2014               7

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

                     In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A2 final report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in Crime No. 687/2009 of Palluruthy Police

Station, Ernakulam which is now pending as S.C. No. 677/2011

on the file of the Addl. Sessions Court, (Adhoc-II) , Ernakulam.

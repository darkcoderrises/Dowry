                              O R D E R

     The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No. 1613 of

2013 of Sakthikulangara Police Station who is alleged to

have committed the offences punishable under Sections

493, 323 and 107 read with Section 34 of IPC.

     2.   The allegation against the petitioner is that

concealing his earlier marriage, he made the defacto

complainant believe that he is unmarried and married her

and had sexual intercourse with her. Later on, he picked up

quarrel with her and demanded more dowry from her.

     3.   The petitioner would say that he is innocent and

has been falsely implicated and the main contention raised

is that the marriage with the defacto complainant is not

valid.  The petitioner would also say that he has not

committed any act as alleged. It is also claimed that the

defacto complainant had voluntarily lived along with him.

                              -2-



     4.    The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition

and pointed out that it is a clear case where there has been

fraud played by the petitioner to the detriment of the victim

and the matter may not be taken lightly.         Further, it is

pointed out that the investigation is at an infant stage.

     5.    After having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor and having

perused the records, the claim of the petitioner that he is

totally innocent cannot be accepted.      Admittedly, he was

married at the time when he subsequently married the

defacto complainant and making her believe that it was a

valid marriage, he subjected her to sexual intercourse. It is

also claimed by the defacto complainant that 25 sovereigns

of gold and  1,25,000/- was given at the time of marriage.

The further allegation is that he continued to demand more

and more money and ultimately the defacto complainant

and others enquired about the petitioner, she came to know

the truth. Under the above circumstances, it is difficult to

B.A. No. 8768/2013
                                -3-



accept the claim of the petitioner that he is innocent.

      6.    Considering the totality of the circumstances, it is

felt that it is not a fit case where extraordinary jurisdiction of

this Court needs to be exercised in favour of the petitioner.

      The petition is devoid of merits and is accordingly

dismissed.

      However, if so advised, the petitioner may surrender

before the Investigating Officer on or before 29.01.2014,

who after interrogation, shall produce him before the JFCM

Court concerned. If the petitioner moves an application for

bail before the said court, the learned Magistrate shall

consider and pass appropriate orders thereon in accordance

with law, preferably on the date of surrender itself.

                    Crl.M.C. No.2568 of 2015
                  -------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of April 2015


                              O R D E R


      Petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.1049 of 2013 on

the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg. The

learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Section

498A of Indian Penal Code, based on a private complaint filed by

the third respondent. Now, it is submitted on behalf of the

petitioner that the entire disputes between the petitioner and

the third respondent have already been settled and the third

respondent has also sworn an affidavit which is produced along

with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A4. Therefore, the prayer in this

Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.1049 of

2013 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg.

      2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioner, learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent Nos.1 and 2 and the

learned counsel for the third respondent.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

Crl.M.C. No.2568 of 2015

                               -: 2 :-

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise

of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

power given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences

under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent

power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has

to be exercised in accordance with the guidelines engrafted in

such power viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash

the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised

where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such

power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and

gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be

fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and

the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not

private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly,

any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to

the offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption

Crl.M.C. No.2568 of 2015

                                -: 3 :-

Act or the offences committed by public servants while working

in that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand

on a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out

of matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes

where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and

the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these

categories of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings,

if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender

and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak

and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair

or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

Crl.M.C. No.2568 of 2015

                                -: 4 :-

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

     4.     The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

committed an offence punishable under Section 498A of the

Indian Penal Code.

     5.     Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioner and the third respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the third

respondent has also stated that the third respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioner.

The third respondent has also filed Annexure-A4 affidavit before

this Court in this regard.

     6.     In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.1049 of

2013 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg can be quashed by this Court invoking the powers

Crl.M.C. No.2568 of 2015

                                -: 5 :-

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light

of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's

case (supra).

            In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C.No.1049 of 2013 on the file of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg against the petitioner is

quashed.

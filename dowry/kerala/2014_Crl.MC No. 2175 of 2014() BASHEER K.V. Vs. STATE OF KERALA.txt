                   Crl.M.C.No.2175 of 2014
           -------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 21st day of May, 2014

                              ORDER

     This is an application filed by accused numbers 1 to 3 in

Crime No.2899/2012 of Central Police Station, Ernakulam to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement u/s 482 of Code

of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are accused in

Crime no.2899/2012 of Central Police Station, Ernakulam. The

case was registered on the basis of the complaint given by the

de facto complainant against the petitioners alleging offences

u/s 406 and 420 r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The matter

has been now settled between petitioners and respondents 2 to 8

who according to the prosecution were the persons alleged to have

been cheated by the petitioners. In view of the settlement there is

no possibility of conviction. Since the matter is in the crime stage

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014                 2



neither the police nor the court will drop the proceedings. So they

have no other remedy to approach this court seeking the following

reliefs:

             i)   Call for the records pertaining to Crime
                  No. 2899/2012 of Central Police Station,
                  Ernakulam and quash Annexure - A1 FIR
                  in the interest of justice.

             ii)  Issue any other order or direction which is
                  appropriate in the circumstances of this
                  case.

      3.    Respondents 2 to 8 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

they have no grievance against the petitioners now and then do not

want to prosecute the matter as well. Counsel for the petitioner

submitted that in view of the settlement there is no possibility of

any conviction even if any final report filed as neither the de facto

complainant nor the witnesses are likely to support the case of the

prosecution to enable them to file any final report against the

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014              3



petitioners. He prayed for allowing the application.




      4. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as directed by

this court, submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioners but opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent Annexure A1 Crime was registered

as Crime No.2899/2012 of Ernakulam Central Police Station

alleging offences under Section 406 and 420 r/w Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code. The main allegation was that admissions were

given to the students alleging that it is a recognized course and

subsequently it was revealed that there is no recognition for the

course. Investigation is still in progress. Respondents 2 to 8 are

the affected students and they have now settled the claim with the

accused persons and now they do not want to proceed with the

investigation. Further it is also seen from the affidavits filed by

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014                4



them that due to the intervention of mediators, the matter has been

settled and adequate compensation has been paid to the students by

the accused as well and also they have stated that except the

respondents 2 to 8, no other persons have been affected on account

of act of the accused and others have no complaint as well. So

considering the fact that the matter has been settled between the

parties by paying adequate compensation, this court feels that no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the investigation of the

case or trial of the case later as neither the de facto complainant nor

the other witnesses are likely to co-operate with the investigation

and conviction in such case will be remote even if final report is

filed. Further it cannot be said that it is having public interest as

such and in fact it is also in the nature of private dispute between

students and the management which has been amicably settled due

to the intervention of well wishers and mediators.

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014                 5



      6. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:

                        "The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the power
           of the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding
           or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
           given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is
           of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
           justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
           where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
           of each case and no category can be prescribed.
           However, before exercise of such power, the High
           Court must have due regard to the nature and
           gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
           mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
           though the victim or victim's family and the offender
           have settled the dispute.      Such offences are not
           private in nature and have serious impact on society.
           Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
           offender in relation to the offences under special
           statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
           offences committed by public servants while working
           in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
           quashing     criminal   proceedings   involving  such
           offences.        But   the  criminal    cases  having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014                 6



           or such like transactions or the offences arising out
           of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
           words, the High Court must consider whether it
           would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
           to    continue  with   the   criminal   proceeding   or
           continuation    of  the   criminal  proceeding    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
           settlement and compromise between the victim and
           wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
           it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if
           the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
           the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
           quash the criminal proceeding."




      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also since the matter has been settled between the parties and no

purpose will served by either the investigation is allowed to

continue or the trial of the case proceeded later, as there is no

possibility of either the de facto complainant or the witnesses to

Crl.M.C No.2175/2014              7



support or co-operate with the investigating agency to file a final

report and even if a final report has been filed, conviction in such

cases will be remote, this court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings to save the judicial time and also

time of the investigating agency. So the application is allowed and

further proceedings in Crime No.2899/2012 of Central Police

Station, Ernakulam as against the petitioners is hereby quashed.

       Office is directed to communicate this order to the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam to inform the same to the

concerned Police Station for necessary further action in the matter.

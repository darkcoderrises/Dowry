           Petition filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

      2.   Petitioner        is    the      1st    accused         in  Crime

No.528/2013 of Hosdurg Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 420, 406 and 120B IPC

and Section 15(3) of the Indian Medical Council Act.

      3.   After making a false representation that the

petitioner was a Post Graduate in Orthopedics and had

obtained MS Degree in it, he had entered into a contract of

marriage with the de facto complainant woman by obtaining

an amount of 20 lakhs and 300 sovereigns of gold

ornaments. Within a short period, the entire gold ornaments

were taken away by the petitioner and his mother and some

of those gold ornaments were disposed of and a good

quantity of the balance gold ornaments were pledged in

BA.601/2015
                              : 2 :



three banks for huge amounts. After misappropriating her

entire gold ornaments and money, she was tortured to the

maximum, by demanding more dowry. He has never

obtained any degree in Orthopedics and he is not even a

medical graduate at all. In fact, on a false representation

that he had acquired MS Orthopedics Degree, he had

practised at a hospital as Orthopedist. His formal arrest has

been recorded in this case on 16.01.2015 while he has been

undergoing detention in Crime No.511/2013 of Hosdurg

Police Station registered for the offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323, 506(i) and 498A read with Section 34

IPC.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

counsel for the de facto complainant and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     5.    The learned counsel for the de facto complainant

has pointed out that once the petitioner was enlarged on bail

and thereafter, he was absconding and subsequently, he

BA.601/2015
                               : 3 :



has surrendered on 09.01.2015 in Crime No.511/2013. The

learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner

has undertaken to settle the matter within a short span of

time on his enlargement of bail and the pledged gold

ornaments can be obtained and released within a short

span of time. Having regard to the period undergone by the

petitioner in custody, the present stage of investigation and

the possible chance of settlement in the matter, I am

satisfied that the petitioner can be enlarged on bail on strict

conditions.

      6.   In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and

the petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on his executing a

bond for `1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) with two

solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of

the concerned Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)  Both    the   sureties  shall  produce
      solvency certificates for 1,00,000/- each before
      the court below.

BA.601/2015
                                 : 4 :




           (ii)  The petitioner shall report before the
     Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
     on all Mondays and Thursdays commencing from
     09.03.2015 for a period of six months.

           (iii) The petitioner shall not tamper with the
     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (iv)  The    petitioner    shall  make himself
     available for interrogation as and when required by
     the Investigating Officer.

           (v)   The petitioner shall not involve in any
     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

              =====================
             Dated this the 6th day of August, 2014

                            ORDER
                          -------------

      This is an application filed by the petitioner to quash the

order in Crl.M.P.No.6463/2012 in CC.526/2010 of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Haripad under section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure. (herein after called the Code)

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that, petitioner is the

defacto complainant in CC.526/2010, on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Haripad. She is aggrieved by the

order of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Haripad in

not ordering summons to the second respondent who is working

abroad through Indian Embassy.

      3.    The case of the petitioner is that, the accused

person after her marriage with the first accused ill-treated her

on demand of dowry and alleging commission of offences under

section 323, 406, 498A, r/w section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

The case was registered, and after investigation, final report

was filed. The respondents 3 and 4 who arrayed as 2 and 3,

appeared before the court below, and took bail and they are

contesting the matter. But the first respondent, who is working

in Sultanate of Oman has not appeared till date and no

summons was served on him. Court below has decided to

proceed with the case in respect of persons appeared and split

CRL.M.C.NO.2000 OF 2013               2

up the case as against the non-appearing accused but no new

number was assigned to the split up case. So the petition was filed

through Assistant Public Prosecutor as Crl.M.P.6463/2012 to issue

summons to the first accused in the known address through Indian

Embassy but the learned Magistrate has dismissed the application.

Aggrieved by the same, the present petition has been filed.

      3.    Respondents 3 and 4 appeared through counsel. Notice

sent to second respondent also returned as signed but none

appeared for him

      4.    A report has been called for from the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Haripad as per order dated 23.07.2014 as

directed by this court and the learned Magistrate has sent a report

which reads as follows:-

      "In obedience to the Official Memorandum cited above, I may
      humbly submit the following for kind consideration.

        I am holding the additional charge of the Judicial First Class
        magistrate -I, Haripad for the period from 17.07.2014 to
        31.07.2014.
        CC.526/10 is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of
        Police, Kanakkunnu, in Crime No.48/2010 against A1.Shiju,
        A2.Sukumary and A3.K.S.Biju for the offences punishable
        under section 498(A), 406, 323 r/w 34 IPC.      Charge was
        framed against A2 and A3 on 23.05.2012.            CW1 was
        examined in part as PW1. On 17.05.2013 the matter was
        stayed by the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala for a period of
        one   month     vide  order  in  Crl.M.A.No.4199/2013       in
        Crl.MC.No.2000/13. Subsequently stay was extended for a
        period of 3 months on 13.11.2013.           On 13.02.2014,
        03.03.2014 PW1 prayed for producing extended stay order.
        On 04.03.14 PW1 filed affidavit. On 17.06.2014 PW1 further
        prayed time for producing extended stay order.      Now the
        case CC.526/10 stands posted to 06.08.14 for further
        examination of PW1.
        On perusal of the proceedings sheet of the case CC.526/10, it
        is seen that on 15/10/2010 summons issued against A1 Shiju
        was served by affixure. So non bailable warrant was issued

CRL.M.C.NO.2000 OF 2013                 3

        against A1. The warrant was returned unexecuted stating
        that he was abroad. I humbly submit that during the period
        of hearing dates from 21.07.2011 to 13.12.2012, no further
        steps initiated against the said A1 Shiju. On 03.12.2012, the
        learned Assistant Public prosecutor filed a petition seeking
        order to issue summons to A1 Shiju through the Indian
        Embassy,     Muscat.     That   petition  was  dismissed   on
        13.12.2012 and the case against A1 in CC.526/10 was refiled
        as CC.1155/12. Warrant of arrest and steps under section
        82, 83 Cr.PC were issued against the A1 in CC.1155/12. The
        case CC.1155/12 is now posted to 31.07.14 for addressing
        the Hon'ble Chief Judicial Magistrate Alappuzha for according
        sanction to transfer the case to the Long Pending register.
        It is seen from the case records that the case against A1 is
        pending as CC.1155/12 and the case against accused No.2
        and 3 are pending as CC.526/10.
        The matter is reported before the Hon'ble High Court of
        Kerala for favour of kind cosndieration".

      5.     The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even in the

main case, no summons was issued to the first respondent's

address. Though the case was proceeded with, without splitting the

case, the petitioner filed application for issuing summons to the

accused through the Indian Embassy, but that was dismissed by the

learned Magistrate. If the case is not split up, there is no purpose

in keeping the case together without taking steps to the first

accused to be served. So the petitioner has grievance in the order

passed by the court below.

      6. The counsel for the respondents 3 and 4 submitted that the

case against the first accused has been now split up and steps are

being taken to procure the presence of first accused. Since the first

accused is not appearing, case against them need not be prolonged

as they are facing trial for the last four years.

      7.     The learned Public Prosecutor also supported the case of

CRL.M.C.NO.2000 OF 2013            4

the petitioner.

      8.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the complaint

given by the present petitioner against respondents 2 to 4 alleging

offences under section 498A, 406, 323 r/w section 34 of Indian

Penal Code, the case was registered as crime no.48/2010 of

Kanakakunnu police station and after investigation, final report was

filed and it was originally taken on file as CC.526/2010 pending

before the Judicial first Class magistrate Court-I, Haripad. It is seen

from the report that since first accused did not appear, charge was

framed against accused numbers 2 and 3 and it was posted for

evidence and the present petitioner was examined in part and

thereafter, as per the orders of this court the further proceedings

has been stayed. It is seen from the report that the first accused

was served by affixture and non bailable warrant was issued and it

was returned stating that he was abroad. So the case against him

was split up and refiled as CC.1155/2012 and proceedings have

been initiated under section 82 and 83 of the Code and now

sanction has been asked for transfering the case to register of long

pending cases. So the first submission made in the petition that

case against the first accused has not been in split up appears to be

not correct in view of the report submitted by the learned

magistrate.   Since the case against the first accused has been

already split up and numbered as CC.1155/2012, there is no

CRL.M.C.NO.2000 OF 2013            5

necessity to wait for disposal of the case as against the accused 2

and 3 who are now facing trial in CC.526.2010. So there is no

necessity to keep the proceedings of CC.526/2010 pending till the

prayer asked for the petitioner is complied with. So the lower court

has perfectly justified in dismissing the application stating that the

steps required by the petitioner can be taken in this split up case

against the first accused and I don't find any reason to interfere

with the order passed by the court below and the court below is

directed to proceed with CC.526/2010 as against accused numbers

2 and 3 in the case and dispose of the case in accordance with law

and the petitioner is directed to cooperate with the trial of the case.

      9.    As regards CC.1155/2012, is concerned, there is some

force in the submission made by the counsel for the petitioner that

since he was working abroad, an attempt has to be made to serve

notice on first accused through Indian Embassy so as to make him

know about the pendency of the case as against him. The question

has come before this court in the decision reported in (Chathu Vs

Gopalan) 1981 KLT 103, regarding service of summons who is

residing outside India, and whether it can be served through Indian

Embassy, instead of, effecting service by affixture in any of the

houses in India where he is expected to come and reside and this

Court has held that in cases where the persons sought to be

summoned is actually working abroad, summons cannot be served

CRL.M.C.NO.2000 OF 2013           6

by affixture in any of the houses in India under section 65(1) of

Code of Criminal Procedure and effort must be made to serve

notice on him through the Indian Embassy of that place.             So

considering the circumstances, this court feels that before

transferring the case to the register of long pending cases and the

learned Magistrate has mentioned in the impugned order to take

steps to issue summons to the first accused in the address shown

by the petitioner in the split up case, fi such an application is filed

by the petitioner in that case and attempting that then dispose of

the case in accordance with law.

      With the above observations and directions the petition is

disposed of. The interim order of stay granted in CC.526/2010 as

per order in Crl.M.A.4199/2013 and extended from time to time is

vacated. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

               ===========================
                     Crl.M.C No.4109 of 2014
              ============================
               Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014

                             ORDER


      Petitioners are accused 1 and 2 in C.C No.675/2009 pending

in the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam. They

seek an order under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure

quashing Annexure II final report and all further proceedings in the

above C.C as the matter has been settled with the 2nd respondent.

      2. Heard the learned counsel for petitioner, counsel for the

2nd respondent and also the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3.    It appears that the first petitioner married the 2nd

respondent on 18.04.2009 in accordance with the rites and custom

prevailing among Muslim community and while they were residing

in the house of first petitioner, as per the allegation, the 1st

Crl.M.C No.4109/2014              2



petitioner demanded more dowry and some difference of opinion

occurred and it is also alleged that the gold ornaments given to 2nd

respondent was misappropriated and misutilised by the accused.

The first petitioner/accused is the husband of 2nd respondent and

the second petitioner is the mother-in-law of 2nd respondent.

      4. Case of the petitioners as well as the 2nd respondent is that

the entire dispute is settled and the marriage between the first

petitioner and 2nd respondent has been dissolved by pronouncing

Talak on the basis of the settlement arrived. The 2nd respondent

has sworn into an Annexure IV affidavit dated 16.07.2014 to the

above effect. In Annexure 4 affidavit, it is stated that she is not

proposed to prosecute the criminal case against the petitioners and

she has no objection and grievance in quashing the final report and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners.

Crl.M.C No.4109/2014                    3



      5. From the facts indicated above, it can be seen that all

criminal proceedings initiated are connected with some family

dispute which now settled by the parties to the dispute. At this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
         Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
         and different from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends
         of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
         Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
         category can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C No.4109/2014                        4



It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
            pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
            the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
            from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership
            or such like transactions or the offences arising out of
            matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
            where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
            and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
            category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
            proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
            between the offender and victim, the possibility of
            conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
            criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
            prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
            not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
            settlement and compromise with the victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision will be squarely applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to give effect to the settlement arrived

between the parties. In view of the changed version of the 2nd

Crl.M.C No.4109/2014              5



respondent, according to me, even if the trial is proceeded, there is

no scope for any fruitful prosecution rather it will be resulted in

sheer wastage of time. Therefore, it is just and proper to quash all

proceedings pending against the petitioners.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed quashing Annexure II

final report and all further proceedings in C.C No.675/2009

pending against the petitioners in the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam.

                  Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 29th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No. 897 of 2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Aluva which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No.1979 of 2012 of

Aluva Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 427, r/w 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-AI charge sheet and all further proceedings in

C.C.No. 897 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Aluva as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

27.7.2012    at   10.30   a.m.   the   accused   herein   formed

themselves into an unlawful assembly and broken and

damaged the window glasses, plastic and steel chairs, desks,

benches, flex boards, name board of the Principal, switch

boards, switches, NCC Boards, electric wires, aqua guard water

purifier of the Al-Ameen College at Edathala and sustained a

damage to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/- and thereby all the

petitioners/accused committed the aforesaid offences and thus

Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013          2


according to the prosecution, the petitioners are committed

the offences punishable under Section 143, 147, 427 r/w 149

of IPC. Now the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court. The petitioners are students and the de

facto complainant is the principal of the college in which the

petitioners are studying. Annexure-A2 is the affidavit sworn

into by the de facto complainant who, is the 2nd respondent.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013         3


petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Section 143, 147, 427 r/w

149 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013           4


reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:      the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint     in   exercise  of   its  inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
         has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases      power    to  quash    the    criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend on
         the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having
          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes     of  quashing,  particularly   the
          offences      arising    from     commercial,
          financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or
          such like transactions or the offences
          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
          is basically private or personal in nature
          and the parties have resolved their entire
          dispute.    In this category of cases, High
          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013          5


         its  view,    because   of   the  compromise
         between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
         and continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to
         him by not quashing the criminal case
         despite    full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter

is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.3155 of 2013         6


         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - AI charge sheet and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.897 of 2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Aluva.

                       B.A. No.2616 of 2013
                 ---------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 11th day of April, 2013


                               O R D E R


          Petitioners are accused in Crime No.307/2013 of

Sasthamkotta Police Station, who were alleged to have

committed offences punishable under Section 498A read with 34

of IPC.

      2.  First petitioner married the defacto complainant on

134.2010 and a child was born out of the wedlock on 17.1.2011.

The allegation against the petitioners is that they not only

misappropriated the money given to the victim at the time of

marriage but also continued to persecute her demanding more

dowry.

      3.  The petitioners would say that they are innocent and

have been falsely implicated with ulterior motive. It is pointed

out that there are several proceedings pending before the

various courts regarding various matters.

      4.  Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition

pointing out that there are serious allegations against the first

petitioner and the second petitioner is said to have aided the

B.A.No.2616/2013                  :2:


first petitioner.

       5.   CD was made available for perusal.        On going

through the CD, there are very serious allegations against the

petitioners for having manhandled the victim. The claim of the

petitioners that they are innocent and have not committed any

act as alleged cannot be readily accepted in view of the

materials available in the CD. A deeper probe into the matter is

not warranted at this point of time.     However, it has been

noticed that the allegations are mainly levelled against the first

petitioner.    The role of the second petitioner is minimal.

Considering the facts and circumstances, the petition is

disposed of as follows:

1.The petition stands dismissed as against the first petitioner is

  concerned.

2.The petition stands allowed as against the second petitioner is

  concerned, subject to the following conditions:

      (1) The second petitioner shall surrender before the
  Investigating Officer on or before 18.4.2013, who after
  interrogation shall produce her before the Judicial First Class
  Magistrate's court concerned, which      court on application
  being moved by her shall release her on bail on her executing
  a bond for a sum of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten thousand only)
  with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the
  satisfaction of the said court.

    (2) The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

B.A.No.2616/2013                    :3:


    sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts, before granting
    bail.

    (3)   The   second   petitioner    shall  report   before   the
    Investigating Officer on every Wednesday between 9 a.m.
    and 10 a.m.

    (4) The second petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to
    tamper with the evidence and influence or try to influence
    the witnesses.

    (5) If any of the conditions is violated, the bail granted shall
    stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied
    of the said fact, may take such proceedings as are available
    to him in law.


                                               Sd/-
                                        P.BHAVADASAN,
                                               Judge.

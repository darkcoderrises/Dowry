                    --------------------------------
           Dated this the 18th day of November, 2014

                            O R D E R
                            ---------------

     The petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.No.663 of

2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Kunnamangalam for the offences under Sections 406, 498A

and Section 34 IPC, has come up with this Crl.M.C under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. to get the proceedings in C.C.No.663 of

2013, quashed.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC by demanding more

dowry after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and

money.

     3. According to the petitioners, presently the matter

Crl.M.C.No.6497/2014
                                : 2 :


has been settled amicably and the defacto complainant has

no complaint against the petitioners at present. An affidavit

has been sworn in by the 3rd respondent, who is the defacto

complainant, affirming that all the matters involved are

settled amicably and the matters pending before the Family

Court, Kozhikode have also been settled through mediation.

As the matter has been settled, according to the 3rd

respondent, she does not want to proceed with the matter.

      4.     The defacto complainant/3rd respondent has

entered appearance through her counsel and the learned

counsel for the 3rd respondent also endorses the fact that

the affidavit has been sworn in by the 3rd respondent on her

on volition. As the matter has been amicably settled, there

is no meaning in proceeding with the matter further and

therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.663 of 2013 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kunnamangalam

can be quashed.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A1

Final Report as against the petitioners and all further

Crl.M.C.No.6497/2014
                                 : 3 :


proceedings in C.C.No.663 of 2013 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Kunnamangalam are hereby

quashed.

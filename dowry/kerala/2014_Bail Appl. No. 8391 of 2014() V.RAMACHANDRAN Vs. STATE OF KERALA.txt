                      B.KEMAL PASHA, J.
                     ====================
                      B.A. No.8391 of 2014
                    =====================
            Dated this the 18th day of December, 2014

                            O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1450 of 2014

of the Nemmara Police Station, Palakkad District, registered

for the offences punishable under Sections 498 A and 304 B

IPC.

      3. Deceased Saritha was given in marriage to the 1st

petitioner on 13.12.2007. At the time of marriage, she was

provided with 35 sovereigns of gold ornaments and the 1st

petitioner was paid an amount of 75,000/- as dowry. He had

misappropriated the entire gold ornaments and money and

repeatedly demanded properties from the house of the

deceased. She was severely tortured and harassed by the 3rd

B.A. No.8391 of 2014            2

petitioner, who is the mother of the 1st accused. She was

made to work severely at the field. On 16.10.2014 also she

was working at the field along with the 1st accused. After

works, when she came back, she was severely scolded and

abused by the 3rd petitioner. As she could not withstand the

harassment, she consumed rat poison and went to the field,

where the 1st accused was working. By the time, she

collapsed and she was taken to the hospital, where she died

on 23.10.2014.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned Senior Public Prosecutor.

      5.    The contents of the CD prima facie reveal the

complicity of petitioners 1 and 3. The contents of the CD

contains the statement furnished by the deceased at the

hospital, which clearly speaks volumes against petitioners 1

and 3.     At the same time, she has not stated anything

regarding the 2nd petitioner, who is the father of the 1st

petitioner, in the incident. Considering the seriousness of the

allegations against petitioners 1 and 3, I am of the view that

they are not entitled to the discretionary relief of anticipatory

B.A. No.8391 of 2014                3

bail. At the same time, when there are no specific allegations

levelled against the 2nd petitioner by the deceased, I am of the

view that anticipatory bail can be granted to him.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed in part and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the 2nd petitioner, is directed to

enlarge the 2nd petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

his executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand

only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to the

following terms and conditions:-

           (i)    The 2nd petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00     a.m.  on     all Mondays      and Thursdays

     commencing from 22.12.2014 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.

           (ii)   The 2nd petitioner shall not tamper with

     the evidence or influence witnesses.

           (iii) The 2nd petitioner shall make himself

B.A. No.8391 of 2014              4

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The 2nd petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

            This bail application as far as petitioners 1 and 3

are concerned, is dismissed.

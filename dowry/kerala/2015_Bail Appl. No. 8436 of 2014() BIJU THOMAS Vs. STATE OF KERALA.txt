          ............................................................
             Bail Application No.8436 of 2014
         ..............................................................
         Dated this the 9th day of March, 2015.


                           O R D E R




     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioner is the first accused in Crime

No.716/2014 of the Pariyaram Medical College Police

Station, Kannur registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498 (A) read with Section 34 IPC.

     3. The allegation against the petitioner is that he

had tortured and harassed the de-facto complainant who

is his wife and treated her with cruelty by demanding

more dowry and gold ornaments, after misappropriating

her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4 . Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.    The contents of the C.D reveal that the

investigation of the case is practically over. It does not

Bail Application No.8436 of 2014 2

reveal that the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is

required for the continued investigation of the case. Being

a matrimonial offence, considering the possibility of a

reunion or settlement, I am of the view that this is a fit

case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioner.

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who

is conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to

enlarge the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

his executing a bond for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

             (i)  The petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

      a.m.      on   all    Mondays    and     Thursdays,

      commencing from 16-3-2015 for a period of

      three months or till the filing of the final report

      in this case, whichever is earlier.

             (ii) The petitioner shall not tamper with

      the evidence or influence witnesses.

Bail Application No.8436 of 2014  3

             (iii) The petitioner shall make himself

      available     for   interrogation as   and    when

      required by the investigating officer.

             (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

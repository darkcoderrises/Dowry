         --------------------------------------------------
                    Crl.M.C.No.6404 Of 2015
          --------------------------------------------------
          DATED THIS THE 28th DAY OF APRIL, 2015

                              ORDER

       The petitioners are arrayed as accused 1 to 7 in the final

charge in Crime No.467/12 of Kayamkulam Police Station, now

pending   before   the   Judicial  First   Class   Magistrate  Court,

Kayamkulam as C.C.No.784/2013, alleging offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 277, 451, 294(b), 427 and 506(i) IPC,

based on a private complaint filed by the second respondent. Now,

it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the entire disputes

between the petitioners and the second respondent have already

been settled and the second respondent has also sworn to an

affidavit which is produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A2.

Therefore, the prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire

proceedings in C.C.No.784/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam.

      2.   Heard the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned

counsel for the second respondent.

Crl.M.C.No.6404/14                -2-


      3.     In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is

of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

Crl.M.C.No.6404/14               -3-


in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on

a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where

the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of

cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,

because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,

the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

Crl.M.C.No.6404/14                -4-


complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 277,

451, 294(b), 427 and 506(i) IPC.

      5.     Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the second respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second

respondent has also stated that the second respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.

The second respondent has also filed Annexure A2 affidavit

Crl.M.C.No.6404/14               -5-


before this Court in this regard.

      6.     In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No. 784/2013

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kayamkulam, can be quashed by this Court invoking the powers

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light

of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's

case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C. No.784/2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam against the petitioners is

quashed.

            ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 2nd day of September, 2013

                             ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.125/2011 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kanjirappally which is a

case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Section 498 A and r/w Section 34 of I.P.C.,

with   a   prayer    to  quash   Annexure-2     final  report   in

C.C.No.123/2011 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Kanjirappally (in Crime No.35/2011 of the Manimala

Police Station) as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.       The prosecution allegation is that the first

accused married the defacto complainant and thereafter the

accused demanding more dowry and accusing her that she is

not pretty enough and thus harassed her mentally and

physically and thus according to the prosecution, the accused

has committed the offence punishable under Section 498 A

and r/w Section 34 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that during the pendency of the above case the entire disputes

with the second respondent who is the defacto complainant is

Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
                                2

settled and now the first petitioner and the second respondent

are leading a happy marital life. The second respondent,

defacto complainant had sworn into Annexure -3 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
                                     3

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 498 A and r/w Section 34

of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court,

in the decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and

Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD

817(SC)], has held as follows:-

                "7.   It is not in dispute that matrimonial

          disputes have been on considerable increase in

          recent times resulting in filing of complaints under

          Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against

Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
                                     4

          the husband but also against the relatives of the

          husband. The question is when such matters are

          resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the

          matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

          pending    disputes  for   which   both   the   sides

          approached the High Court and jointly prayed for

          quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or

          complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406

          of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the

          sole ground that since the offences are non-

          compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

          would be impermissible for the court to quash the

          criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                 8. It is not in dispute that in the case on

          hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal

          complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

          Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,

          1961, with the help and intervention of family

          members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

          concerned have amicably settled their differences

          and executed a compromise/settlement. Pursuant

          thereto, the appellants filed the said compromise

          before the Trial Court with a request to place the

          same    on   record  and    to  drop   the   criminal

          proceedings against the appellants herein.       It is

          also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual

          settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-

          wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she did

          not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

          the appellants and fully supported the contents of

          the settlement deed.     It is the grievance of the

          appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such

Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
                                      5

          prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed

          toe exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of

          the Code only on the ground that the criminal

          proceedings relate to the offences punishable under

          Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-

          compoundable in nature."

                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts

          to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial

          disputes, particularly, when the same are on

          considerable increase.     Even if the offences are

          non-compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial

          disputes and the Court is satisfied that the parties

          have settled the same amicably and without any

          pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing

          ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not

          be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing of

          FIR,   complaint    or   the   subsequent     criminal

          proceedings.

                    13.    There has been an outburst of

          matrimonial    disputes   in  recent  times.      The

          institution of marriage occupies an important place

          and it has an important role to play in the society.

          Therefore, every effort should be made in the

          interest of the individuals in order to enable them

          to settle down in life and live peacefully.     If the

          parties ponder over their defaults and terminate

          their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

          instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order

          to do complete justice in the matrimonial matters,

          the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

          extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that

          the power under Section 482 should be exercised

Crl.M.C. No. 3723 of 2013
                                    6

          sparingly and with circumspection only when the

          Court is convinced, on the basis of material on

          record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

          would be an abuse of the process of the Court or

          that  the   ends   of  justice require  that  the

          proceedings ought to be quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

                                7

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-2 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.123/2011 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Kanjirappally.

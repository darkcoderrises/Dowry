                 Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who is the accused in Crime

No.653 of 2011 of Peroorkada Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 420, 506(1) r/w 34 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A FIR and all

further proceedings in the above crime, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that the de

facto complainant entrusted the renovation works of her

house to the 1st petitioner upon an oral agreement for

Rs.3 lakhs and on 11.3.2011, the 1st petitioner accepted

Rs.2 lakhs in advance from the de facto complainant. After

executing minor works, on 6.4.2011, the 1st petitioner

Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                               2

demanded Rs.2 lakhs more for purchasing materials and

the de facto complainant took loan from the bank and paid

it to him, but no work was done by the petitioners, instead,

the petitioners demanded more money for completing the

work and it is alleged that only work for Rs.1 lakh has been

done by the petitioners and thereby committed the offence

as alleged by the prosecution. Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                                3

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance

against them.

         6.        I  have carefully considered  the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 420, 506

(1) r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                                    4

note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                                   5

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

Crl.M.C.No.4196 of 2014
                               6

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A FIR in Crime No.653 of 2011 of Peroorkada

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in the above crime.

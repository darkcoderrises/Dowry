                    Crl.M.C.No. 1609 of 2013 - A
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 19th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 5 in C.C.No.1156 of 2012      of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamcotta,      which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 729 of 2011 of

Sasthamcotta Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143,147,148,447,324 and 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure I FIR and Annexure 2 final report in Crime

No.729/2011 of Sasthamcotta Police Station as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2.   The allegation against the petitioners in the above case is

that at about 12.30 in the noon on 1.7.2011 due to previous animosity

between the 4th year students and mechanical branch students of BMC

Crl.M.C.NO.1609 of 2013
                                 :-2-:

Engineering College, Sasthamcotta at the instance of the second

accused, accused Nos.3 to 15 trespassed into the college and attacked

the de facto complainant and others. Now the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court and therefore, they approached

this Court for recording the above settlement.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

respondents 2 to 6. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for respondents 2 to 6, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the second respondent

submitted that the above respondents [second respondent, who is the

de facto complainant and respondents 3 to 6 are the injured] do not

Crl.M.C.NO.1609 of 2013
                                  :-3-:

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.      Annexure 3 is the affidavit of the de facto

complainant who is the second respondent in the above Crl.M.C. and

the other injured, who are respondents 3 to 6, have also filed

Annexures 4 to 7.       I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 143,147,148,447,324 and 149 of I.P.C. which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

Crl.M.C.NO.1609 of 2013
                                            :-4-:

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents, it appears to me that the injured/the de facto complainant

have no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57.     The position that emerges from the above
           discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
           Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
           in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
           from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
           in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
           of any Court.        In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
           the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
           be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

Crl.M.C.NO.1609 of 2013
                                       :-5-:

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such
         like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
         relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
         of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
         of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
         quashing the criminal case despite         full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"


         8.     According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of

this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

Crl.M.C.NO.1609 of 2013
                                 :-6-:

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I

FIR and Annexure 2 final report in Crime No.729/2011 of

Sasthamcotta Police Station and       all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.1156 of 2012 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Sasthamcotta.

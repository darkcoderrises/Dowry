                Crl.M.C. NO. 2544 of 2014
           ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                            ORDER



            Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime

No.224/13 of Kurathikadu Police Station, which is initiated at

the instance of the second respondent, who is the de facto

complainant, alleging offences punishable under Sections

498 (A) and 406 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The

petitioners submit that the entire disputes between the first

petitioner and the second respondent have already been

settled and they have decided to file a petition for divorce on

mutual consent under Section 13 (B) of the Hindu Marriage Act.

The second respondent has also filed Annexure 2 affidavit

before this Court stating that the entire dispute has been

settled amicably and she does not want to prosecute the

complaint made against the petitioners. Therefore, the prayer

in this Crl.M.C. is to quash Crime No.224/13 on the file of the

Crl.M.C. NO. 2544 of 2014      2


Kurathikadu Police Station.

      2. Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel appearing for the

second respondent.        Learned counsel for the second

respondent submits that the second respondent has already

settled the matter with the first petitioner and she does not

want to prosecute the complaint made against the petitioners.

      3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108, the

Apex Court held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly

and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing

for the purpose of quashing, particularly offences arising from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating

to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is

basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

resolved their entire dispute. In these category of cases, High

Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view, because

of the compromise between the offender and the victim, the

possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

Crl.M.C. NO. 2544 of 2014      3


caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In

other words, the High Court may consider whether it would be

unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

criminal proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings

would tantamount to        abuse of process of law despite

settlement and compromise between the victim and wrong-

doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the

answer to the above question is in affirmative the High Court

shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

proceedings.

      4.     The allegation made against petitioners is for

commission of offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and

406 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Now, the

second respondent has filed Annexure 2 affidavit before this

Court stating that the entire dispute has been amicably settled

and she does not want to prosecute the matter further. In

such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the proceedings

in Crime No. 224/13 of the Kurathikadu Police Station can be

quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482

Crl.M.C. NO. 2544 of 2014     4


of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles

laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case supra.

      5. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in Crime No. 224/13 of the Kurathikadu Police

Station is quashed.

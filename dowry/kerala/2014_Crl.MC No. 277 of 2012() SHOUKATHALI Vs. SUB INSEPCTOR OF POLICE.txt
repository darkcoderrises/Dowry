             .........................................
               Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
             .........................................
           Dated this the 20th day of February, 2014

                         O R D E R

         This is a petition filed under Section 482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure praying that Annexure II

in Crime No. 61/09 of Mavoor Police Station pending

before Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kunnamangalam

which was registered under Section 498(A) and 406

IPC may be quashed. The allegation is that petitioner

married the fifth respondent on 22.12.1996 as per

Muslim customary rights, thereafter, both of them

resided together as husband and wife in the

matrimonial house.        While residing so, petitioner ill

treated her both physically and mentally demanding

more amount as dowry.            In the circumstances, she

was forced to reside with her parents. Thereafter, she

filed Annexure-II complaint before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamangalam, which was

forwarded to Mavoor Police for investigation under

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                 2


Section       156(3)of     Cr.P.C.  Mavoor   Police,  after

investigation filed Annexure-II before the Judicial First

Class      Magistrate     Court,  Kunnamangalam.    In the

circumstances, petitioner approached this Court with this

petition contending that if the trial is continued it will

amount to double jeopardy and merely an abuse of

process of court.

      2.        The    learned  counsel appearing  for the

petitioner contended that the marriage with fifth

respondent was actually solemnized on 01.11.1996 as

per customary rights and thereafter, they resided

together. The fifth respondent filed another complaint

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Thamarasserry with the same allegation under Section

406 and 498(A) IPC for the same incident and after trial,

petitioner was acquitted by Annexure-I judgment. The

allegation in CC 441/09 before the Kunnamangalam

Magistrate Court and CC 331/09 before the Thamrasserry

Magistrate Court are based upon the same set of facts.

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                      3


Hence, Annexure-II is to be quashed.

      3.     The learned Public Prosecutor also admitted that

the petitioner had undergone trial for the same set of

facts and he was acquitted in the earlier trial.

      4.      Section 300(1) of the Cr.P.C says that a person

once convicted or acquitted is not to be tried for same

offence. It reads as follows:

         "300. Person once convicted or acquitted not
         to be tried for same offence.- (1) A person who
         has once been tried by a Court of competent
         jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or
         acquitted of such offence shall, while such
         conviction or acquittal remains in force, not be
         liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor
         on the same facts for any other offence for which
         a different charge from the one made against him
         might have been made under sub-section (1) of
         section 221, or for which he might have been
         convicted under sub-section (2) thereof."

      The short point raised in the above section is with

regard to the application of doctrine of "double jeopardy."

This maxim guarantees the basic pleas of "autrefois

acquite and autrefois convict.", which is guaranteed

U/s.300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An analysis of

Section 300 (1) will bring out that 'a person who has once

been tried by a court of competent jurisdiction for an

 Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                              4


offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall,

while such conviction or acquittal remains in force, not be

liable to be tried again for the same offence. While Article

20(2) does not in terms maintain a previous acquittal,

Section 300 of the Code fully incorporates the principle

and explains in detail the implications of the expression

"same offence". Six illustrations in the section explain its

concrete terms and the different situations which the

courts may have to deal with. The explanation portion

"acquittal" has been explained in negative terms which

says that the dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of

the accused is not "acquittal" because both are not

considered as the final decisions regarding the innocence

of the accused person. The word "tried" in Section 300

(1) does not necessarily mean tried on the merits. The

composition of an offence under Section 320, or a

withdrawal from the prosecution by the Public Prosecutor

under Section 321, would result in an acquittal of the

accused even though the accused is not tried on merits.

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                     5


Such an acquittal would bar the trial of the accused by a

second complaint on the same facts.

      5.     The plea of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict

are taken as a bar to criminal trial on the ground that the

accused person had been once already charged and tried

for the same alleged offence and was either acquitted or

convicted. These rules are based on the principle that "a

man may not be put twice in jeopardy for the same

offence." Article 20(2) of the Constitution recognises the

principle as a fundamental right. It says, "no person shall

be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more

than once.".

Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Section

71 IPC read as follows:

               "26. Provision as to offences punishable under
              two or more enactments.- Where an act or
              omission constitutes and offence under two or
              more enactments, then the offender shall be
              liable to be prosecuted and punished under
              either or any of those enactments, but shall not
              be liable to be punished twice for the same
              offence."

              "71. Limit of punishment of offence made up of
              several offences- Where anything which is an

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                     6


              offence is made up of parts, any of which parts
              is itself an offence, the offender shall not be
              punished with the punishment of more than one
              of such of is offences, unless it be so expressly
              provided."

The Apex Court in Sangeetaben Mahendrabhai patel v. State

of Gujarat and another [(2012) 7 SCC 621] held as follows:

          "The fundamental right which is guaranteed under
          Article 20(2) enunciates the principle of 'autrefois
          convict' or 'double jeopardy' i.e. a person must not
          be put in peril twice for the same offence.        The
          doctrine is based on the ancient maxim nemo debet
          bis punire pro uno delicto, that is to say, that no one
          ought to be punished twice for one offence. The
          plea of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit avers
          that the person has been previously convicted or
          acquitted on a charge for the same offence as that
          in respect of which he is arraigned.
                                         (paras 14 and 15)
          Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay AIR 1953 SC
          325: 1953 Cri LJ 1432, S.A. Venkataraman v. Union
          of India ARI 1954 SC 375: 1954 Cri. LJ 993,
          followed
                 The issue estoppel rule is but a facet or
          doctrine of autrefois acquit. Where an issue of fact
          has been tried by a competent court on an earlier
          occasion and a finding has been recorded in favour
          of the accused, such a finding would constitute an
          estoppel or res judicata against the prosecution, not
          as a bar to the trial and conviction of the accused
          for a different or distinct offence, but as precluding
          the acceptance/reception of evidence to disturb the
          finding    of  fact  when    the   accused    is   tried
          subsequently for a different offence.      This rule is
          distinct from the doctrine of double jeopardy as it
          does not prevent the trial of any offence but only
          precludes the evidence being led to prove a fact in
          issue as regards which evidence has already been
          led and a specific finding has been recorded at an

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                     7


          earlier criminal trial. Thus, the rule relates only to
          the admissibility of evidence which is designed to
          upset a finding of fact recorded by a competent
          court in a previous trial on a factual issue. What is
          necessary is to analyse the ingredients of the two
          offences and not the allegations made in the two
          complaints. (paras 15 and 22 t 24)

                 Doctrine of double jeopardy is enshrined in
          Section 300 Cr.P.C and Section 26 of the General
          Clauses Act.      Both the provisions employ the
          expression "same offence". There may be cases of
          misappropriation, cheating, defamation etc. which
          may give rise to prosecution on criminal side and
          also for action in cvil court/other forum for recovery
          of money by way of damages, etc. Therefore, it is
          not always necessary that in every such case the
          provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution may
          be attracted. In order to attract the provisions of
          Artilce 20(2) of the Constitution i.e., doctrine of
          autrefois acquit or Section 300 Cr.P.C. or Section
          71 IPC or Section 26 of the General Clauses Act,
          the ingredients of the offences in the earlier case as
          well as in the latter case must be the same and not
          different.   The test to ascertain whether the two
          offences are the same is not identity of the
          allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the
          offence. Motive for committing the offence cannot
          be termed as the ingredients of offences to
          determine the issue. The plea of autrefois acquit is
          not proved unless it is shown that the judgment of
          acquittal in the previous charge necessarily involves
          an acquittal of the latter charge. (Paras 14, 15 and
          30 to 33).

      6.     Now, what remains for consideration is that

whether this is a fit case to invoke inherent jurisdiction.

According to Section 482 of Cr.P.C, inherent jurisdiction

can be invoked to make such orders necessary to "give

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                        8


effect to any order" under this code or prevent "abuse

of the process" of any court or to recure the "ends of

justice". In the State of Haryana v. Bhajanlal,                   [1992 SCC

(Crl) 426] held thus:

              "(1) Where the allegations in the FIR/complaint,
       even if they are taken at their face value do not prima facie
       constitute any offence against the accused.         (2)
       Where the allegations in the FIR of other materials do not
       constitute a cognizable offence justifying an investigation
       by the police under Section 156(1) of the code except
       under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of
       Section 155(2). (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations
       in the FIR/complaint and the evidence collected thereon
       do not disclose the commission of any offence. (4) Where
       the allegations in the FIR/complaint do not constitute any
       cognizable offence but constitute only non-cognizable
       offence to which no investigation is permitted by the police
       without the order of Magistrate under Section 155(2).
        (5) Where the allegations are so absurd and inherently
        improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can
        ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
        for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an
        express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the
        Code or the Statute concerned (under which the
        proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
        of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
        provision in the code or in the statute concerned,
        providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the
        aggrieved party. (7) Where a criminal proceeding is
        manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the
        proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive
        for wreaking vengeance on the accuse with a view to
        spite him due to private and personal vengeance.

      7.       When this matter was brought before me, I

directed the learned Public Prosecutor to ascertain the

facts and submit a report.                 As per the direction, Sub

reported that both cases were registered on the basis of

same allegation. The report reads as under:

      8.     It is clear from the above report that the fifth

respondent filed the petition before the Circle Inspector

of Police, Medical College Police Station which was

referred to Mavoor Police Station.       The Mavoor Police

registered a crime 61/09 under Section 498(A) and 406

IPC and after investigation, the Sub Inspector of Police,

Women Cell laid charge before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kunnamangalam and that case is under

trial. For the same set of facts, the fifth respondent filed

another complaint on 12.03.2009 before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Thamarasserry, which was

forwarded to Mukkom Police Station. On receiving the

complaint. Mukkom Police registered the Crime 94/09

under Section 498(A) and 406 IPC and after completing

investigation, a Final Report was filed before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate-II, Thamarasserry and the case

was tried as C.C No. 331/2009 and the petitioner was

acquitted on 21.10.2011 under Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C.

A close scrutiny of the above report of the Sub Inspector

Crl.M.C.No. 277 of 2012
                                 11


of Police, Mavoor on 20.02.2014 shows that the case is

hit under Section 300 of Cr.P.C. Section 300 IPC shows

that the person who is once tried by a court of competent

jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of

the offence and as such conviction or acquittal remains in

force, he shall not be tried against the same set of facts.

The principle has been derived from Article 20 of the

Constitution of India which has been recognized as a

fundamental right. Therefore, I am of the view that this

is a fit case to quash the second trial in CC 241/2009

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kunnamangalam invoking inherent jurisdiction under

Section 482 Cr.P.C.

        Hence,         Annexure-II is hereby quashed under

Section 482 Cr.P.C and the Crl.M.C is accordingly allowed.

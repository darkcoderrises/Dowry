          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 18th day of February, 2014


                                    O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

sole accused in C.C.No.302/2012 on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod, to quash the

proceedings, recording the composition under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the

'Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.929/2012 of

Kasaragod police Station, which was registered on the

basis of a statement given by the defacto-complainant, who

is the first respondent herein, alleging offences under

Section 326 and 294(b) of Indian Penal Code. The allegation

was that, on 26.07.2012, at about 8.30 a.m., due to the

previous enmity of the petitioner with the defacto-

complainant, abused him with obscene language and

Crl. M. C. No.1184 of 2014
                                     2

assaulted him with a wooden stick and caused grevious hurt

and thereby he had committed the offence punishable under

Section 294(b) and 326 of Indian Penal Code. After

investigation, the investigating officer submitted final

report     before      the   Chief     Judicial   Magistrate  Court,

Kasaragod, where it was taken on the file as C.C.No.302/12

and it is pending before that court.               Later due to the

intervention of mediators and well-wishers, the matter has

been settled between the defacto-complainant and the

petitioner. The defacto-complainant does not want to

prosecute the case.          Since the offence alleged are non-

compoundable in nature, the petitioner has no other option

but to approach this court to quash the proceedings,

invoking the power under Section 482 of the 'Code', So the

petitioner field this application, seeking the following relief:

             "It is therefore most humbly prayed that this
      Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash Annexure-A1
      Final    Report     and    all   further   proceedings in
      C.C.No.302/2012 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,
      Kasaragod as against the petitioner/accused person in
      this petition, in the interest of justice."

                                  3

            3.     First respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and the defacto-complainant has no objection in

quashing the proceedings and he had also filed Annexure-

A2 affidavit stating these facts.

            4.     Learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the

2nd   respondent on instructions submitted that, both the

petitioner and the defacto-complainant are natives of

Rajasthan and there is no other case against the petitioner

in Kasaragod District.

            5.     It is an admitted fact that both the petitioner

and the first respondent are natives of Rajasthan and they

came to Kasaragod for eking out their livelihood. It is also

an admitted fact that in respect of an incident happend on

26.07.2012, on the basis of the statement given by first

respondent, Kasaragod police registered a case against the

petitioner as Crime No.929/2012, alleging offences under

Section 294(b) and 326 of Indian Penal Code and after

Crl. M. C. No.1184 of 2014
                                       4

investigation Annexure-A1 final report was filed and it was

taken on the file as C.C.No.302/2012 of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod, and it is pending before that

court. It is also an admitted fact that the matter has been

settled between the defacto-complainant, injured and the

petitioner and he had filed Annexure-A2 affidavit stating

that the matter has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of the relatives and well-wishers and they

are now living in harmony and working together and he has

no objection in quashing the proceedings as against the

petitioner.

            6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be

Crl. M. C. No.1184 of 2014
                                       5

      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             7.     It is an incident happened due to some

alteration occurred between the petitioner and the first

respondent due to some mis-understanding, which resulted

in the injury being caused to the defacto-complainant and

Crl. M. C. No.1184 of 2014
                                6

registering the case against him. Both are coming from

Rajasthan and now they have settled the disputes between

them and residing together in the same quarters and

working together amicably. In the decision reported in Gian

Singh's case (supra), it has been observed that, if a dispute

arose due to some private incident, which is of not public

importance and the matter has been settled between the

parties, due to the intervention of mediators and well-

wishers and they are living in harmony, then that should be

promoted by accepting the composition and the High Court

must to invoke the power under Section 482 of the 'Code'

and quash the proceedings, as no purpose will be served by

retaining the case and allowing the case to continue, in view

of the settlement arrived at between the parties.

            8.     The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted

that the petitioner has no other criminal back ground as

well. So considering the circumstances, I feel that, it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of the 'Code' has

Crl. M. C. No.1184 of 2014
                                   7

to be invoked to promote harmony, that has been restored

on account of the settlement between the parties arrived at

due to the intervention of family members, relatives and

well-wishers and quash the proceedings against the

petitioner.     So     the petition   is   allowed   and     further

proceedings in C.C.No.302/2012 (Crime No.929/2012 of

Kasaragod Police Station) pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod, is quashed. Office is directed

to communicate this order to the concerned court for

necessary further action.

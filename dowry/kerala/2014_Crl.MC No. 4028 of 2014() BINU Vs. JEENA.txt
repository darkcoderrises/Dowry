                Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
        Dated this the 18th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in

C.C.No.2579 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Thrissur, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No.788 of 2014 of Nedupuzha

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Sections

461 and 380 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexures 1

and 2 FIR and final report in the above crime, as the

matter is settled out of court.

       2. The allegation in the above case is that while the

accused and the de facto complainant was working at Sun

Medical Research, Sakthan Nagar, Thrissur as staff nurse,

on 19.5.2014 the complainant changed her dress in the

Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                               2

dressing room and kept her gold bangle in her bag in the

shelf and locked the shelf and later when she opened the

bag for taking food, she found that the bangle is missing

and in connection with this incident, the petitioner was

arrested in the above crime.          Now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, as per

Annexure 3 affidavit.     Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law

and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received         from the

respondents submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                                3

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

against the petitioner.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents

and materials produced along with the above petition. In

the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to

the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no

objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 461 and

380 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for

the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant        has  no  further  grievance  against   the

Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                                    4

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. At this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal     cases   having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire

Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                                   5

         dispute.    In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.               Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Crl.M.C.No.4028 of 2014
                              6

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures 1 and 2 FIR and final report in Crime No.788 of

2014 of Nedupuzha         Police Station and all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.2579

of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Thrissur.

      Petition filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.877/2014 of the

Nedumangadu Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 304(B), 498(A) IPC, and Section 3(2)(v) of the

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)

Act, 1989.

      3.    A 24 year old woman, a member of the Scheduled

Caste, who is the wife of the petitioner, committed suicide by

hanging. She was pregnant. There is another child also, who is

presently with the father of the petitioner. It is alleged that the

victim had obtained a loan from Janasree for the purpose of the

petitioner. When she asked the petitioner to return the loan amount,

B.A. No.6291 of 2014
                                  2

he wanted her to obtain dowry from her house in order to repay the

loan. The victim, who had no other go than to commit suicide,

committed suicide by hanging, within three years of her marriage.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the

petition. The petitioner was arrested on 16.7.2014, and thereafter,

he has been in custody. It seems that the investigation is practically

over. No criminal antecedents have been reported against the

petitioner. Continued detention of the petitioner is not required for

the purpose of investigation in this case. Having regard to the

period undergone by the petitioner in custody, and the present stage

of investigation, I am of the view that the petitioner can be

enlarged on bail.

      6.    In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and the

petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on his executing a bond for 

1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties for the

like sum each to the satisfaction of the court below, and subject to

B.A. No.6291 of 2014
                                     3

the following terms and conditions:-

      (i)   The petitioner shall report before the Investigating

Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Fridays and Tuesdays,

commencing from 12.9.2014 for a period of three months or till the

filing of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

      (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the evidence or

         Dated this the 25th day of March 2014


                           O R D E R


     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.131/2014 of

Veeyapuram Police Station, Alappuzha District.           The

offences alleged against him and other accused are

punishable under Secs.498A and 306 r/w 34 of IPC.

Petitioner is the husband of deceased Soumya.            The

allegation is that she was subjected to physical and mental

cruelty by the petitioner and others. It is alleged that the

petitioner herein used to make unlawful demand for dowry

and used to manhandle her. Because of the intolerable and

cruel treatment meted out to her, she at first attempted to

commit suicide by cutting the vein on 15.2.2014. She did

not die. She, thereafter committed suicide by hanging at 4

AM on 16.2.2014. Therefore, it is not a false case registered

against the petitioner, the prosecution contends.

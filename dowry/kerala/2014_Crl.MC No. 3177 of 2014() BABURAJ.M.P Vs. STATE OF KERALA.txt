               --------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 20th day of June, 2014


                                O R D E R


           This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.798/2014 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Hosdurg, to quash

the proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure.

           2.    It is alleged in the petition that, the petitioner

has been arrayed as an accused in Crime No.33/2014 of Hosdurg

police station, on the basis of the complaint given by the 2nd

respondent, alleging offences under Section 118(d) of Kerala

Police Act.  After investigation, Annexure-II, final report was

filed and it was taken on file as C.C. 798/2014 and pending

before the   Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Hosdurg.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties and no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case on account of

the settlement.      Since the offence is non-compoundable in

nature, they could not file an application before the court below

Crl. M.C.3177 of 2014
                                   2

for that purpose. So the petitioner has no other remedy, except

to approach this court, seeking the following reliefs:

            "On these and other grounds that may be urged at
      the time of hearing it is most humbly prayed that this
      Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash Annexure A2
      final report filed in Annexure A1 FIR in Crime
      No.33/2014 of Hosdurg police station, in Kasaragod
      District, and all further proceedings in C.C.798/2014
      pending on the files of the JFCM Court-1, Hosdurg, to
      secure the ends of justice and in the interest of justice".

            3.     2nd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that, the matter has been settled between the parties

due to the intervention of mediators and well-wishers and the

petitioner had understood the mischief committed by him and he

had forgiven the act of the petitioner and he does not want to

prosecute him any longer.         He had also filed Annexure-AIII

affidavit stating these facts.

            4.     The counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that, in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and conviction in such cases will be

remote. So he prayed for allowing the application.

            5.     The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that,

except this case, there is no other case against the petitioner but

oppose the application.

Crl. M.C.3177 of 2014
                                  3

            6.     It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of a

complaint given by the 2nd respondent against the petitioner,

alleging that he had abused him by using his mobile and also

sent threatening messages. Annexure-AI first information report

was registered as Crime No.33/2014 of Hosdurg police station

against the consumer of the mobile phone No.9446660566

alleging offence under Section 118(d) of Kerala Police Act.

During investigation it was revealed that, the petitioner is the

owner of that mobile phone and he has been implicated in the

case and Annexure-II final report was filed and it was taken on

file as C.C.798/2014 and pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-1, Hosdurg. Now the matter has been settled

between the parties. The complainant had no grievance against

the petitioner any more. Both of them have filed Annexure-III

affidavit stating that, due to the intervention of mediators, the

matter has been settled and the petitioner has no objection in

quashing the proceedings. There is no criminal antecedents for

the petitioner as well. Considering the fact that the matter has

been settled, there is no possibility of conviction in such cases

and allowing such cases to continue will only amount to the

Crl. M.C.3177 of 2014
                                       4

wastage of judicial time. It is true, that the mobile phones has

become some times nuisance to others, but if the other party had

pardoned the mischief committed and the petitioner had

repented for what he had done, then, that will have to taken into

account by the courts, to promote their settlement.

            7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.     Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

Crl. M.C.3177 of 2014
                                       5

      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




             8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision, and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and no purpose will be served by

continuing the case and conviction in such cases are remote,

this court feels that, it is a fit case where power under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings to promote settlement, which resulted in

harmony between the parties.

             So the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.798/2014 (Crime No.33/2014 of Hosdurg police station)

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg, as against the petitioner is quashed. Office is directed

to communicate this order to the concerned court, immediately.

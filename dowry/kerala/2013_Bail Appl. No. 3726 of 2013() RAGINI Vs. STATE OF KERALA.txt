              Dated this the 3rd day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Petitioner is the second accused in Crime

No.629/2013 of Paravur Police Station, registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the de facto

complainant, who is the wife of the first accused, and treated

her with cruelty be demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. Apart from the

usual allegations, being set forth in a case under Section

498 A IPC, the contents of the CD do not reveal any specific

allegations against the petitioner. Considering the facts and

circumstance of this case, I do not think that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioner is required for the continued

investigation of this case. Matters being so, anticipatory bail

can be granted to the petitioner on conditions.

     4. In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

B.A. No. 3726 of 2013
                                    2

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of her arrest on her

executing a bond for `25,000/-(Rupees Twenty five thousand

only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to

the following terms and conditions.

           (1) The    petitioner     shall report   before   the

     Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

     all Wednesdays and Saturdays, commencing from

     10.07.2013 for a period of three months or till the filing

     of the final report in this case, which ever is earlier.

           (2) The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (3) The petitioner shall make herself available for

     interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

     Officer.

           (4) The petitioner shall not involve in any offence

     while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

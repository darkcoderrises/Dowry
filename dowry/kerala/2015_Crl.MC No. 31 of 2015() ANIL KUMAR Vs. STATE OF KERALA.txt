                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners         are      the       accused         in   Crime

No.461/2014 of Kudiyanmala Police Station, Kannur district,

registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A,

294(b) and 506(ii) IPC and Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled

Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,

1989.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting  Annexure-1           FIR      in    Crime       No.461/2014      of

Crl.M.C.31/2015
                               : 2 :



Kudiyanmala Police Station as against the petitioners and

all further proceedings based on it pending before the

Judicial    First Class   Magistrate's   Court,   Taliparamba,

quashed.

      4.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry. It is also alleged that the petitioners insulted

the defacto complainant by calling her caste name.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

Crl.M.C.31/2015
                               : 3 :



therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      7.     The defacto    complainant,   who    is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners  and,    therefore,   all  further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

Crl.M.C.31/2015

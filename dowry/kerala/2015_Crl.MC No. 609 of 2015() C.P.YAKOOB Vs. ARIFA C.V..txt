                   Crl.M.C. No. 609 of 2015
             =======================
            Dated this the 6th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R



      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.1420/13 of the

Kondotty Police Station, registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 406 and 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report           in

Crime No No.1420/13 of the Kondotty Police Station, and all

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.279/14 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Malappuram, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 609 of 2015
                                 2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints     against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

Crl.M.C. No. 609 of 2015
                                   3

leading a peaceful married life.         When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the petitioners, it

is only just and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A Final

Report in Crime No No.1420/13 of the Kondotty Police Station,

and all proceedings based on it in C.C.No.279/14 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Malappuram,

are hereby quashed.

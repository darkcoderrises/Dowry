                 --------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 18th day of May, 2012

                             ORDER




      This is an application for regular bail filed by accused Nos.1

to 3 in crime No.624/2012 of Adoor Police Station. The allegation

against the petitioners is that they have committed offences

under Section 324, 308, 498(A) read with 34 of Indian Penal

Code. The case of the prosecution is that the first accused who is

the husband of the defacto complainant and the other accused

who are his parents demanded dowry. Initially, crime was

registered for only offences under Section 498(A), 324 read with

34 of IPC. Later, section 308 was incorporated.

      2.   I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

also the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3.    I have perused the case diary made available by the

learned Public Prosecutor. The wound certificate made available

would reveal that the defacto complainant had not even disclosed

the details such as date and year of the alleged incident. It also

would not reveal any serious injuries. Taking into account such

B.A.No.3273 of 2012
                                    2

matters as also the fact that the petitioners have been in custody

since 10.4.2012, I am inclined to allow this application.

Accordingly the following directions are issued:-

    "1. The petitioners shall be released on bail on their

    executing bond for Rs.50,000/- each with two solvent

    sureties for the like sum to the satisfaction of the Judicial

    First Class Magistrate, Adoor.

    2. The petitioners shall report before the Investigating

    Officer on all Saturdays for a period of three months or

    till the final report is laid, whichever is earlier.

    3. The petitioners shall not intimidate or influence the

    witnesses.

    4. The petitioners shall not leave the limits of the State of

    Kerala without the permission of the Investigating

    Officer."

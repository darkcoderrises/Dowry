                  =================
                 CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014
              =====================
              Dated this the 5th day of June, 2014

                             ORDER
                             --------

      This is an application filed by the sole accused in

CC.No.495 of 2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-I, Attingal to quash the proceedings on

the basis of settlement u/s 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called the Code).

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner was

arrayed as accused in Crime No.506 of 2008 of Attingal police

station on the basis of a statement given by the first respondent

as defacto complainant alleging offences under Sections 323

and 324 of the Indian penal Code and Section 27 of the Arms

Act in respect of an incident happened while they were students

in Government Polytechnic College, Attingal. After investigation,

final report was filed and it was taken on file as CC.No.495 of

2009 and pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Attingal. Now the matter was settled between the parties. On

account of the settlement the original relationship between the

petitioner and the first respondent has been restored. No

purpose will be served by keeping the case on file as well. Since

some of the offences are non compoundable in nature, they

could not file a compounding petition before the Court below.

So, the petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this

CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014             2

Court seeking the following relief:-

      to quash all proceedings in furtherance to Ann-A Crime

      No.506      of   2008    of    Attingal    Police   Station,

      Thiruvananthapuram     Dist  as   against   the   petitioner,

      including CC.No.495 of 2009 on the file of the Judicial First

      Class Magistrate Court, No--I, Attingal forthwith and acquit

      the petitioner.

      3.     First respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and it was an

incident happened during their college days while they were

students and he had now forgiven the act of the petitioner and

the old relationship has been restored and he had filed

Annexure-B affidavit stating these facts. He has no grievance

against the petitioner now.

      4.     The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that on

account of the settlement, no conviction is possible and he

prayed for allowing the application.

      5.      The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioner but opposed the application

on the ground that it was a political issue which resulted in the

incident.

      6.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioner and the first

CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014             3

respondent were students in Government Polytechnic College,

Attingal at the time when the alleged incident happened. It is

also an admitted fact that both the petitioner and first

respondent were members of two student unions of different

political party and incident happened in connection with the

college election conducted during that time in he College. It is

also an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement given

by the first respondent as defacto complainant, crime No.506 of

2008 of Attingal police station was registered against the

petitioner alleging offences under Sections 323, 324 of the

Indian Penal Code and Section 27 of the Arms Act.            After

investigation Annexure-A final report was filed and it was taken

on file as CC.No.495 of 2009 and it is now pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal. Now the

petitioner as well as the first respondent had realised their folly

of indulging in political activities during their college days and

now they have settled their issues and restored their

relationship on account of the settlement forgiving all the past

acts that happened during their college days which happened

without knowing the consequence of their acts under the

influence of political ideologies imposed on them by the political

leaders. In view of the settlement there is no possibility of any

conviction as neither the defacto complainant nor the witnesses

CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014              4

will support the case of the prosecution.

      7.      Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or

      complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

      and different from the power given to a criminal court for

      compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

      limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

      guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

      any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where

      the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

      no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise

      of such power, the High Court must have due regard to

      the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,

      rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

      though the victim or victim's family and the offender

      have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in

      nature and have serious impact on society.         Similarly,

      any compromise between the victim and offender in

      relation to the offences under special statutes like

      Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed

      by public servants while working in that capacity etc;

      cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal

CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014             5

     proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal

     cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

     flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of

     quashing,     particularly  the  offences    arising   from

     commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,   partnership or

     such like transactions or the offences arising out of

     matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes

     where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

     and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this

     category of case, High Court may quash criminal

     proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

     between the offender and victim, the possibility of

     conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

     criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

     prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him

     by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

     complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In

     other words, the High Court must consider whether it

     would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

     continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of

     the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of

     process of law despite settlement and compromise

     between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure

     the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

     put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is

     in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

     jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      8.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact of the matter has been

settled between the parties and incident happened during their

college days while they were students and now they have

CRL.M.C.NO.2709 OF 2014              6

decided to forgive their acts and restored their relationship on

account of the settlement happened due to the intervention of

well wishers of both parties and no purpose will be served by

keeping the case on file as no conviction will be possible in such

cases, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings in order to honour the settlement and

allow the petitioner and the first respondent to lead a better life

in their future and that should not be affected on account of an

incident happened due to their ignorance of their activities under

the colour of politics.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.495 of 2009 (Crime No.506/08 of Attingal Police Station)

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal

as against the petitioner is quashed.

      With    the   above   directions     and  observations,   this

application is disposed of.

      The Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned Court immediately.

                 Crl.M.C.No.3353 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 13th day of August, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.273/2011 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kasaragod which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No.36/2011 of

Vidyanagar Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 r/w Section 149 of

I.P.C., with a prayer to quash the entire proceedings in

C.C.No.273/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod (Crime No.36/2011 of Vidyanagar

Police Station) as the matter is settled out of court.

         2. The prosecution case is that on 21/1/2011 at 2.00

p.m., the petitioners formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly with an intention to commit offence, wrongfully

confined the defacto complainant and assaulted him and thus

according to the prosecution the accused has committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled amicably with the second respondent

Crl.M.C.No.3353 of 2013
                               2

who is the defacto complainant who had sworn into the

Annexure-B affidavit.

         3.  Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5.  The learned counsel for the    second respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received    from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

Crl.M.C.No.3353 of 2013
                                    3

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.       Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

Crl.M.C.No.3353 of 2013
                                      4

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

Crl.M.C.No.3353 of 2013
                                5

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing   all

further   proceedings   pending   against   the  petitioners in

C.C.No.273/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod and all further proceedings thereto.

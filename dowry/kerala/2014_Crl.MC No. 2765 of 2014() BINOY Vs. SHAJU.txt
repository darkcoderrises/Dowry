                 ---------------------------
               Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014
              -------------------------------
        Dated this the 30th day of May, 2014

                          ORDER




     This is an application filed by the accused in Crime

No.67/2014 of Payyannur Police Station, to quash the

proceedings on the basis of the settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called as the 'Code')

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners

are the accused in Crime No.67/2014 of Payyannur

Police Station which was registered on the basis of the

statement     given by de facto complainant/ injured

namely the 1st respondent, alleging conviction of

Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 and 308 read

with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. In fact the

incident occurred in connection with temple festival due

to some misunderstanding between persons who were

friends earlier and due to the intervention of the

mediators and well wishers of both parties, the matter

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014          2

has been now settled and the de facto complainant does

not want to proceed with the case.            In view of the

settlement,       no purpose will be served by alleging

investigation to continue as ultimately even if final report

is filed conviction will not be possible. Since it is in the

crime stage and grave offences were incorporated,

neither the police not the court will             drop further

proceedings even though the matter is settled between

the parties.      So the petitioners are no other remedy

except to      approach this Court seeking the following

relief:

      i)    to quash Annexure AI F.I.R in Crime No.67 of
            2014 of Payyannur Police Station, Kannur
            District;

      ii)   to issue any other appropriate order or direction
            as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit in the
            interest of justice.



      3. First respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties due to the intervention of mediators and he does

not want to prosecute the petitioners and he filed

Annexure A II affidavit stating these facts.

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014        3

      4. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in

view of the settlement,     no purpose will be served in

keeping the case on file and he prayed for allowing the

application.

      5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other

case against the petitioners but since it is in the crime

stage and grave offences were incorporated opposed the

quashing of the case at this stage.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the 1st respondent Annexure A1, First

Information Report was registered as Crime No.67/2014

of Payyannur Police Station against the petitioners

alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324, 308 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

      7. It is seen from the allegations in the petition that

the petitioners and the de facto complainant were friends

and the incident happened as an aftermath of an incident

occurred in the temple ground during the festival in the

temple. Now the matter has been settled between the

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014              4

parties due to the intervention of mediators and the

relationship between the parties has been restored. It is

true that the offence under Section 308 of the Indian

Penal Code has been incorporated and it is a grave

offence but I am not at this stage going by the question

as to whether the allegations are sufficient to attract the

offence under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code itself

in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties.

However, since the matter has been settled between the

parties,     neither the de facto complainant nor their

witnesses will co-operate with the investigation and even

if ultimately,      on the basis of the evidence collected,

final report is filed, no conviction will be possible as the

witnesses will not support the case of prosecution. It will

only the wastage of judicial time as well.

      8. The decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of

      the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding

      or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent

      jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014              5

      given to a criminal court for compounding the

      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power

      is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

      it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

      engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends

      of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

      any Court.     In what cases power to quash the

      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

      exercised where the offender and victim have

      settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

      circumstances of each case and no category can be

      prescribed.     However, before exercise of such

      power, the High Court must have due regard to the

      nature and gravity of the crime.        Heinous and

      serious offences of mental depravity or offences

      like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

      quashed even though the victim or victim's family

      and the offender have settled the dispute.      Such

      offences are not private in nature and have serious

      impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise

      between the victim and offender in relation to the

      offences under special statutes like Prevention of

      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot

      provide   for   any   basis  for   quashing  criminal

      proceedings involving such offences.        But the

      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

      for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

      offences   arising    from    commercial,   financial,

      mercantile,   civil,     partnership  or  such   like

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014              6

      transactions   or   the   offences   arising  out   of

      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

      disputes where the wrong is basically private or

      personal in nature and the parties have resolved

      their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

      because of the compromise between the offender

      and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

      and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

      put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

      extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

      quashing    the  criminal   case   despite  full  and

      complete settlement and compromise with the

      victim.   In other words, the High Court must

      consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to

      the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

      proceeding    or   continuation    of   the  criminal

      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process

      of law despite settlement and compromise between

      the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure

      the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal

      case is put to end and if the answer to the above

      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be

      well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

      proceeding."




      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and on account of the

Crl.M.C.No.2765 of 2014         7

settlement, original relationship between the parties has

been restored and no purpose will be served by allowing

either the investigation to continue or the case to be

proceeded with       after final report as the conviction of

such cases will be remote, this Court feels that it is a fit

case where power under Section 482 of the Code has to

be invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote

the settlement which restored the relationship between

the parties.

      So the application is allowed and further proceedings

in Crime No.67/2014 of the Payyannur Police Station as

against the petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to

communicate         this order to the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Payyannur to inform the same to the

Payyannur Police Station for necessary further action in

this regard immediately.

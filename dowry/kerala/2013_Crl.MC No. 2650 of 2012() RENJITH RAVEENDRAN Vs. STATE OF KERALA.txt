           Dated this the 8th day of November, 2013.

                                  ORDER


           The petitioner, invoking the inherent jurisdiction of

this court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, seeks to have Annexure 11 final report in Crime

No.977 of 2011 of Gandhi Nagar Police Station taken

cognizance of as C.P.4 of 2012 by Judicial Magistrate of First

Class, Ettumanoor quashed.

           2.   The facts necessary for the disposal of this

petition are as follows:

           The petitioner and the third respondent were

classmates and at the relevant time, the petitioner was

employed with HDFC Bank.                   The engagement ceremony

between the petitioner and the third respondent was held on

16.10.2011 and the marriage was scheduled to be held on

29.1.2012. According to the petitioner, on 21.10.2011, he

got a telephone call from the third respondent informing him

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               2

that she had to convey certain urgent matters to him. She

asked the petitioner to come near Ettumanoor temple. The

petitioner went there and found the third respondent waiting

for him. He also found that the third respondent was in the

company of the fourth respondent. The third respondent is

alleged to have disclosed that she was in deep love with the

fourth respondent and she would like to marry him. Taken

aback and shocked, the petitioner was unable to react

immediately. Recovering soon, he expressed his anguish in

having not disclosed this fact either to the parents of the third

respondent or to the petitioner earlier which could have

avoided the ceremony held on 16.10.2011.         Shattered, the

petitioner left the place. The petitioner came to understand

later that the third respondent had eloped with the fourth

respondent and stayed in a house at Thrissur. Finding that his

daughter has not returned home on 21.10.2011, the second

respondent, who is the father of the third respondent, laid a

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                3

complaint before the police who registered crime under

Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act for man missing as Crime

No.955 of 2011.        The statement      given by the second

respondent, based on which crime was registered, is produced

as Annexure 2. Respondents 3 and 4 were located by the first

respondent on 22.10.2011.         The third respondent gave

Annexure 3 statement to the police wherein she disclosed that

she was in deep love with the fourth respondent and she had

no intention to marry the petitioner. She was later produced

before the JFCM, Ettumanoor and Annexure 4 is the statement

said to have been given by her to the Magistrate.

             3. While things stood so, to the shock and surprise

of the petitioner, since the second respondent was not

interested in having his daughter married to the fourth

respondent, he wanted the petitioner to marry his daughter.

It is alleged that on 24.10.2011, the second respondent and

the brother-in-law of the second respondent took the

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                 4

petitioner to the house of the brother-in-law of the second

respondent and threatened him that he should marry the

daughter of the second respondent. It is stated in the petition

that the third respondent was also brought there and she and

the petitioner were locked in the same room. However, the

third respondent was firm that she would marry only the

fourth respondent. Even though an attempt was made to have

the marriage between the petitioner and the third respondent

registered, it was failed due to technical reasons and the

petitioner managed to escape.

             4.   Annoyed, infuriated and dejected, the second

respondent hatched a plan and registered Crime No. 977 of

2011 for the offence under Section 376 of I.P.C. against the

petitioner. He managed to have the third respondent to give a

statement to the police that while the petitioner and the third

respondent were studying for the degree course in K.E.

College, Mannanam, they had fallen in love with each other

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                5

and that on three occasions the third respondent was

subjected to sexual intercourse against her will by the

petitioner.    The three instances were one in August, 2009,

another in November, 2009 and the last in the year 2011 and

all the three instances alleged to have been taken place inside

the car of the petitioner on a public road. Annexure 5 is the

relevant FIR. Though the petitioner was initially arrested by

the police, he was let off. However, he was re-arrested on

29.10.2011 and was produced before the Magistrate on

31.10.2011 and he was released on bail on the same day. To

the dismay of the petitioner, in the remand application filed by

the police, he found that Section 377 of I.P.C. has also been

incorporated.      According to the petitioner, the second

respondent, with ulterior motive, had got another crime

registered as Crime No.1168 of 2011 under Section 365 and

376 of I.P.C. against the fourth respondent. The copy of the

FIR is produced as Annexure 9.            The petitioner had

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                6

approached this Court for quashing the FIR in Crime No. 977

of 2011. While the case stood posted for instructions, it was

submitted that final report has been filed and therefore, the

petitioner withdrew his application for quashing the FIR with

permission to take such steps as are available to him in law.

             5. According to the petitioner, the third respondent

has no consistent case and she goes on giving statement after

statement to suit her will so as to please her father who is in

the police force. Explanation offered for giving Annexures 3

and 4 by the third respondent cannot be accepted. According

to the petitioner, the second respondent had knowledge about

the relationship between his daughter and the fourth

respondent and that would be evident from Annexure 2 FIS

statement laid by him which led to the registration of Crime

No. 955 of 2011 under Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act.

The petitioner would allege that the story of rape and the

subsequent registration of crime No. 977 of 2011 are with

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                 7

oblique motive and to force the petitioner to marry the third

respondent. The petitioner would also point out that the fifth

respondent is even more loyal than the king and he in his

wisdom chose to add Section 377 of I.P.C. also. Nowhere in

the statement given by the third respondent, she had a case

of any such act having been committed by the petitioner which

would attract the said provision. It is clear, according to the

petitioner, that it was at the instance of the second respondent

that the said provision was added. A perusal of the materials

would clearly show that the proceedings instituted against the

petitioner is reple   in malafides and is ill-motivated.    It is

inconceivable, according to the petitioner, that the third

respondent would have been raped on three occasions in a car

on a public road and that itself shows the hollowness of the

case put forward by the third respondent. Alleging that the

allegations are inherently improbable and are totally false as

could be seen from the various Annexures, the petitioner

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                  8

would say that continuance of the proceedings as against him

will amount to abuse of process of court and is only just and

proper that this Court exercises its inherent powers under

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and put an end to the proceedings.

             6. The second and third respondents have filed a

counter affidavit. In fact the second respondent has filed an

affidavit on behalf of the third respondent also.            The

engagement ceremony held on 16.10.2011 and the decision to

have the marriage conducted on 29.1.2012 are admitted.

However, it is pointed out that after the engagement ceremony

was over, the family members of the petitioner expressed their

displeasure regarding the dowry and that continued to exist

even as the date of marriage approached.          In the counter

affidavit, it is specifically alleged that while things stood so,

the petitioner and the fourth respondent conspired together

and in furtherance of the conspiracy invited the third

respondent on 21.10.2011 for a casual meeting at 10 a.m.

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                9

near Ettumanooor Siva Temple. When the third respondent

reached the place, the petitioner took the third respondent to

a nearby shop and they had a glass of fruit juice. While they

were taking the fruit juice, the petitioner called the fourth

respondent over phone and soon thereafter the fourth

respondent reached the place. According to this respondent,

as planned earlier by the petitioner and the fourth respondent,

a quarrel was stage managed between the fourth respondent

and the petitioner wherein the fourth respondent claimed that

he and the third respondent were in deep love for over an year

and the petitioner should back out of the marriage.       This

unexpected development made the third respondent upset,

who shrieked and then it is contended that the petitioner

pushed the third respondent aside and left her to the mercy of

the fourth respondent and the petitioner left the place. Since

this drama was staged in the public and since attention of

shop keepers and the by-passers was attracted, the third

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                 10

respondent wanted to escape from the place and taking

advantage of the situation, the fourth respondent offered to

drop the third respondent in her house. Believing the fourth

respondent, the third respondent got into the car. Instead of

taking her to her home, he took her to Thrissur though the

third respondent protested to the said act of the fourth

respondent.       It is also claimed that in the car, the third

respondent tried to contact the petitioner, but he did not

respond. The fourth respondent took the third respondent to

a house at Irinjalakuda on 21.10.2011 and on that night, it is

alleged that the fourth respondent brutally raped the third

respondent twice. The next day morning, i.e., on 22.10.2011,

the fourth respondent and the third respondent returned in a

car arranged by one Mahesh Krishna, a Police Constable, who

is a close friend of the fourth respondent. In the car, it is

alleged that the fourth respondent threatened the third

respondent with dire consequences if she revealed what had

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                              11

transpired between them and that he would do away with her.

It was under those circumstances that Annexures 3 and 4

happened to be given by the third respondent.        In Crime

No.1168 of 2011 registered by the Ettumanoor Police,

statement of the third respondent under        Section 164 of

Cr.P.C. was taken and there she had explained the

circumstances under which Annexures 3 and 4 happened to be

given. The third respondent therein had also stated that the

petitioner and the third respondent had fallen in love while

they were studying in degree course and promising to marry

her she was forced to have sexual intercourse with the

petitioner. It is also contended that the two crimes namely,

Crime Nos. 977 of 2011 and 1168 of 2011 should be

simultaneously tried.    It is contended that there are no

grounds made out to quash the proceedings.

             7.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

petitioner contended that the records are self explanatory and

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               12

it can be seen that the third respondent has no consistent

case. Referring to Annexure 2, learned Senior Counsel pointed

out that it came into existence at a point of time when there

was no dispute between the parties and it is clear from

Annexure 2 that even the second respondent knew the

relationship between respondents 3 and 4 and he in no less

terms in Annexure 2 has indicated that in all probability his

daughter must have gone with the fourth respondent. Learned

Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner also pointed out

that the stand taken in the counter affidavit is one of

conspiracy between the petitioner and the fourth respondent ,

but there is no corresponding offence shown in the final

report.    It is also significant to notice, according to the

learned Senior Counsel, that the fourth respondent is not an

accused in Crime No.977 of 2011 and if that be so, the story

of conspiracy falls to the ground.        It is inconceivable,

according to the learned Senior Counsel, that on three

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                13

occasions the third respondent could have been subjected to

sexual intercourse in a car and that too in public places. The

reasons given for Annexures 3 and 4 statements cannot be

taken note of because that is clearly an after thought to get

over the difficulties created by other documents.           It is

significant to notice, according to the learned Senior Counsel,

that it was long after, that the second respondent thought it

proper to have a complaint filed against the fourth

respondent.       According to the learned Senior Counsel, the

facts indicate that the allegations against the petitioner by the

third respondent are false and are only cooked up for the

purpose of the case. Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out

that if at all there was any physical relationship between the

two, that was with the consent and volition of the third

respondent though the petitioner categorically denies any

such relationship. According to the learned Senior Counsel

appearing for the petitioner, this is a typical instance of the

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                14

abuse of process of court and the petitioner has been

unnecessarily implicated and is now forced to face the ordeal

of a trial. Learned counsel pointed out that this is a fit case

where this Court should exercise its power under Section 482

of Cr.P.C. and put an end to the proceedings against the

petitioner.

             8. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents

pointed out that it is not for this Court at this point of time to

peruse the evidence that is now available on record and to

assess its quality and worthiness. This Court could interfere at

this stage only if it is shown that the materials produced along

with the final report and the final report as such, taken

together do not disclose any offence.       The veracity of the

allegations or the quality of evidence or the quantity of

evidence are not matters to be gone into by this Court at this

point of time nor is it competent for this Court to assess the

merits and demerits of the materials collected during

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               15

investigation by the police. May be that the third respondent

has given inconsistent statements before various authorities.

Those statements of the third respondent may be helpful to

the petitioner when the third respondent is examined in the

case. It is too early to evaluate the probative value or the

veracity of the statements given by the third respondent and

that is to be done at the time of trial and not at this stage. It

is not the function of this Court exercising its powers under

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. at this point of time to probe into the

details and to assess the various items of evidence to find out

whether a conviction is possible. The test, according to the

learned counsel, is to see whether on the evidence now

available on record if stands uncontroverted, an offence is

made out. If that test is applied, it can be seen that the claim

for quashing the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

cannot succeed.

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               16




             9.   The petitioner has invoked the inherent

jurisdiction of this Court to quash the final report and the

consequent taking of cognizance by the JFCM, Ettumanoor as

C.P.4 of 2012. True, it may look rather incredible that the

petitioner had committed rape on the third respondent on

three occasions made mention of earlier and that too in a car

on a public road. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner

that all that is stated in the statement made by the third

respondent is that she was subjected to sexual intercourse by

the petitioner promising to marry her. That, according to the

learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, is not sufficient to

attract the offence of rape.   Relying on the decision reported

in Jose Thettayil v. Station House Officer (2013 (3) K.L.T. 552),

it was contended that if at all there was any sexual

intercourse, it was with the consent of the victim and no

offence would lie. Reliance was also placed on the decision

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               17

reported in Babu v. State of Kerala (2013(2)KHC 526)        and

Uday v. State of Karnataka ((2003) 4 SCC 46).

             10. The contention of the petitioner appears to be

that the inconsistent and contradictory versions given by the

third respondent is a clear indication of the fact that she had

little regard for truth and based on such materials it will be

quite contrary to the interests of justice to ask the petitioner

to face trial.

             11.   The third respondent does not disown

Annexures 3 and 4.       But she has offered an explanation

regarding the circumstances under which those statements

were made. It is true that the claim made by respondents 2

and 3 in the counter affidavit that there was a conspiracy

hatched between the petitioner and the fourth respondent may

not be as such acceptable as of now. It is significant to notice

that when the second respondent laid complaint on       finding

his daughter missing, his definite belief was that his daughter

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               18

must have been taken away by the fourth respondent. May be

that the statement given by the third respondent subsequently

to the learned Magistrate and to the police officer which forms

material in Crime No. 977 of 2011 an after thought. One

cannot also omit to note that there is no specific denial in the

counter affidavit by the second and third respondent

regarding the allegations of the petitioner that the petitioner

had been forcibly taken by the second respondent and his

brother-in-law.

             12.   Though the allegations made against the

petitioner may look suspicious, can it be a ground to interfere

at this stage and quash the final report and proceedings taken

pursuant to thereon?     This Court will be well justified in

interfering in cases when it is convinced on materials that the

proceedings amount to an abuse of process of court. At this

stage all that is before this Court are a few statements given

by various witnesses which would appear to be contradictory

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                               19

and inconsistent.    As already noticed, the third respondent

offered her explanation and the circumstances under which

Annexures 3 and 4 were given by her.           Her statements

produced as Annexure R2(a) may be open to doubt. But as

rightly noticed by the learned counsel for the respondents,

this Court may not be justified in probing into the evidentiary

value of those statements or the consequences of the third

respondent giving inconsistent statements. All that this Court

at this point of time needs to ascertain is whether on the

materials now available, the offences attributed to the

petitioner are made out. There may be considerable force in

the submission made by the learned Senior Counsel for the

petitioner that the incorporation of Section 377 of I.P.C. is with

oblique motive. There seems to be absolutely no material

regarding that aspect.

             13. The third respondent has given a statement to

the Magistrate that the petitioner had sexually assaulted her

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                 20

without her consent and against her will. The question as to

whether there is consent or not is a matter to be determined

after trial and unlike in the decision reported in Jose Thettayil

v. Station House Officer (2013(3) K.L.T. 552) it could not be

said that on the very face of it consent can be inferred.

Whether the allegations made by the third respondent against

the petitioner are true or not or whether if at all there were any

physical relationship between the petitioner and the third

respondent, it was with the consent of the third respondent

etc., are matters to be determined during trial. But at any rate,

it is not to be gone into at this point of time.

             14. It may be that the allegations now made against

the petitioner may look suspicious.        May be also that the

implication of the petitioner may be as a result of an after

thought. But it could not be said as of now that there are no

materials based on which final report has been laid.

             15. At any rate, it will not be proper for this Court

Crl.M.C.2650/2013.
                                 21

to exercise its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of

Cr.P.C. and quash the final report and the C.P. proceedings

merely on the ground that the story put forward by the third

respondent is suspicious.

             This petition is without merits and it is accordingly

dismissed. However, the petitioner is at liberty to move the

appropriate court seeking discharge.

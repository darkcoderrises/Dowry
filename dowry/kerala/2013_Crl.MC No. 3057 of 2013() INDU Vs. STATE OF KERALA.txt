           ---------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.NO. 3057 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 24th day of July, 2013

                             ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in Crime No.35/2001 of

Chavara Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

341, 323, 427, 294(b) of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash

Annexure-A Final Report in Crime No.35/2001 of Chavara

Thekkumbhagom Police Station as it is an abuse of process of

court and all subsequent proceedings pursuant in L.P.No.5/2006

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Sasthamcotta as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that on 22/3/2013

at 6.15 p.m., the petitioner wrongfully restrained the defacto

complainant, by caught hold on his shirt and also assaulted him

and there by caused a loss of Rs.250/-. It is further alleged that

the petitioner abused him by using filthy words against him.

Thus, the petitioner committed the offences punishable under

Crl.M.C.NO. 3057 of 2013
                                  2

Sections 341, 323, 427, 294(b) of I.P.C. Now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled between himself and the

defacto complainant who is the second respondent herein. The

second      respondent,  defacto   complainant  has  sworn   into

Annexure-B affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.      Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against her.

Crl.M.C.NO. 3057 of 2013
                                 3

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of

the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in

the above case are only Sections 341, 323, 427, 294(b) of I.P.C.,

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioner accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Crl.M.C.NO. 3057 of 2013
                                        4

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

         distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under

         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude

         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;

         (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse

         of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim have

         settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

         circumstances of each case and no category can be

         prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly

          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

          offences          arising       from         commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

Crl.M.C.NO. 3057 of 2013
                                       5

          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

          parties have resolved their entire dispute.      In this

          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

          between the offender and victim, the possibility of

          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

          criminal case would put accused to great oppression

          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

          and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus,

I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the

trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

                                  6

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as

sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A       and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in in Crime No.35/2001 of Chavara Thekkumbhagom

Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

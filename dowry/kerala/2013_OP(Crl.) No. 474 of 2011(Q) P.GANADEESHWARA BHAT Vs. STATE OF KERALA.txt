                    -----------------------------------------
                       O.P(Crl). No. 474 OF 2011
                    ------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 4th day of February, 2013



                              J U D G M E N T

      Ext. P1 complaint was filed by the father of one Bhavani who

is alleged to have met a dowry death. Second respondent is the

husband of Bhavani and respondents 3 to 7 his close relatives, and,

all, of them are alleged to have perpetrated the death of the victim

by their cruel and inhuman acts. In the crime registered over the

death of the victim, after investigation, police filed a report

Dissatisfied with that report, Ext. P1 complaint was filed by the

father of the victim. After taking evidence of the complainant and

the witnesses produced by him, learned Magistrate committed the

case for trial since the offences disclosed are exclusively triable by

a Sessions Court.

      2.   Ext.P2 is the order of committal. After such committal

alone and the records received in the Sessions Court, petitioner,

son of complainant, who by that time had passed away, realised

that some of the material witnesses including the doctor who

conducted the necropsy over the body of the victim, have not been

examined     during    the      committal        proceedings.   Postmortem

certificate was produced, but, to get it proved as mandated by

O.P(Crl). No. 474 OF 2011
                                       2


law examination of the doctor who conducted the postmortem

was essential.           Similarly, the Tahsildhar who conducted the

inquest and also the Station House Officer who registered the FIR

in the crime were also not cited and examined in the committal

proceedings. In the circumstance, the above original petition was

filed before this court invoking its visitorial jurisdiction under

Article 227 of the Constitution of India for annulling Ext.P2 order

and remitting the case to the Magistrate granting petitioner an

opportunity to examine the witnesses mentioned above, which,

according to him, was essential for a fair trial of the case. In the

alternative, direction to the Sessions Judge to summon and

examine the above witnesses cited though not examined before

the Magistrate, is the relief canvassed.

         2.       Notice given respondents 2 to 7 have entered

appearance through counsel. Occurrence involved in the case,

the death of the victim, Bhavani took place in 18.2.1997. Ext. P1

complaint was filed on 22.9.1997 before the Magistrate

dissatisfied with the report of the police after investigation.

Ext.P2 committal order was passed by the Magistrate after

recording evidence of the complainant and his witnesses on

5.5.2007. After passing such order of committal cognizance of

the offences against the accused taken by the Sessions Judge

O.P(Crl). No. 474 OF 2011
                                     3


the case is awaiting trail.        Nonexamination of one or other

material witness in the committal proceedings cannot be a ground

for annulling the committal order.         Magistrate in committal

proceedings is bound to examine only the witnesses produced by

the complainant. Omission or failure of the complainant to

produce          one     or other material witnesses   in committal

proceedings will no way inhibit the Sessions Court after committal

of the case to issue summons and examine a witness if his

evidence is found essential for a fair trial. Court has ample power

under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to summon

and examine any witness at any stage of the proceedings

provided his evidence is found essential for a fair decision of the

case. After committal of the case involving an offence exclusively

triable by a Sessions court it is not the complainant but the State

is the prosecuting agency. So much so, if on the facts and

circumstances presented and materials produced, examination of

one or other witnesses whose evidence was not recorded in the

committal proceedings is found essential,         it is open to the

Prosecutor to cite such witnesses and seek indulgence of the

court for examining them. Even without such application if the

court finds that the evidence of any such witness who has not

been examined in the committal proceedings is essential for a fair

O.P(Crl). No. 474 OF 2011
                                   4


trial it can do so. This court in Moideen kutty Haji & Others v

Kunhikoya & Others, [KLT 1987 (1) KLT 635 (F.B)], which

arose on a reference, to resolve the conflicting views expressed

earlier whether all witnesses of the complainant should be

examined in the committal proceedings by the Magistrate,

answering such reference held that it is essential to do so. In the

above case examining the question whether the non examination

of one or other witness connected with the case in the committal

proceedings would preclude the Sessions Court from examining

that witness during trial of the case, though such question as

such did not arise for consideration in the reference, this court has

observed as follows:

         "There is no need for us to decide that question especially

in view of almost plenary powers being given to court under

Section 311 to meet any contingency for the just decision of the

case irrespective of the question whether a witness has not been

examined at the stage of enquiry".

Power vested in the court to invoke Section 311 is not hampered

by any other provision covered by the Code. The court has been

empowered under the section to summon any person as a

witness at any stage of enquiry, trial or other proceeding. That

section in fact consists of two parts.      The second part of the

O.P(Crl). No. 474 OF 2011
                                        5


section spells out that where the court finds that the evidence of

any person appear to be essential to the just decision of the case,

it is mandatory. Discretion to be exercised in invoking the section

is available only in other cases. Where just decision of the case

demands examination of a person, the court has to examine such

witness         under Section 311 of the code.      So much so, non

examination of a witness in the committal proceedings by the

complainant will not cause any injury to him            in case on the

materials placed the court finds that examination of such witness

also is essential for a fair decision in the case.

         Subject to the observations made above the original petition

is disposed. Taking note of the time lag after passing of the

Ext.P2 committal order Sessions Judge is directed to expedite the

trial of the case in accordance with law.

              Original petition is disposed of.

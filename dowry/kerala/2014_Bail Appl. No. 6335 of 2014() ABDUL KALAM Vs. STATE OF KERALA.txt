           Dated this the 7th day of October, 2014


                            O R D E R
                            ~~~~~~~


      The petitioner herein is the first accused in Crime No.916

of 2014 of Tellicherry Police Station in Kannur District for

offences under Sections 498A and 406 read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.          The aforementioned crime was

registered on the basis of a private complaint filed by the

petitioner's wife before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Tellicherry as C.M.P.No.2364/2014.             The marriage

between the petitioner and the de facto complainant was

solemnized on 13.2.2004.         The aforementioned crime was

registered   on   23.6.2014.      Apprehending       arrest in the

aforementioned crime, the petitioner herein has preferred this

application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure praying for grant of anticipatory bail.

      2.   The gist of the allegation against the petitioner is

that the petitioner and the other accused (petitioner's brother)

had committed mental and physical torture towards the de facto

B.A.No.6335/2014                2


complainant demanding more dowry and it is alleged that the

accused persons had taken 20 sovereigns of gold ornaments

belonging to the de facto complainant and is not permitting her

to enter into the matrimonial home and is demanding more gold

and money as dowry.

      3.    The petitioner's counsel would vehemently contend

that the petitioner is innocent of these allegations which are

triggered mainly on account of the differences of opinion

between the petitioner and his spouse and that the version of the

de facto complainant is a false story and that during the last

several years the petitioner is working in gulf country. The

counsel for the petitioner would further submit that the de facto

complainant was actually not interested to reside with the

petitioner    at his  house   and   had   quarrelled  with   him

unnecessarily and demanded the petitioner to shift his residence

to her house and that it is on account of such differences of

opinion the de facto complainant has chosen to set in motion the

criminal flops for offence under Section 498A of the IPC etc.

      4.    Heard Sri. K.V. Anilkumar, learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, Sri.Dhanesh

B.A.No.6335/2014                        3


Mathew Manjooran for the respondent State.

      5.    In view of the facts and circumstances of this case and

in the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for

the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, I am inclined to

take the view that discretion could be exercised for the grant of

anticipatory bail       as sought for by the petitioner, subject to

sufficient   conditions       and    safeguards.          Accordingly,     this

application is allowed with the directions that in the event of the

arrest of the petitioner in connection with Crime No.916/2014 of

Tellicherry Police Station, he shall be released on bail on

executing a bond for Rs.35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand

only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

satisfaction of the Investigating Officer concerned                      in the

aforementioned crime and subject to the following conditions:-

       (i)  The petitioner shall surrender his passport, if any, before
            the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned, within three days
            from his execution of the bail bond. If the petitioner is not
            the holder of a passport, he shall file an affidavit to that
            effect in the said court. If the petitioner requires his
            passport for travel abroad, he is free to approach the
            concerned court for the release of the same and in case
            such an application is filed, the       trial court or the
            jurisdictional Magistrate concerned, as the case may be,
            is free to consider the same on merit and to pass
            appropriate orders thereon, taking sufficient guidance
            from the principles laid down by this Court in the case
            Asok Kumar v. State of Kerala [2009(2) KLT 712],

B.A.No.6335/2014                          4


             notwithstanding the aforementioned condition imposed by
             this Court.

        (ii) The petitioner shall report before the Investigating Officer
             in Crime No.916/2014 of Tellicherry Police Station
             between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every alternate Sundays.

        (iii) The petitioner shall not involve in any criminal offence
              similar or graver in nature.

                                          and

        iv) The petitioner shall not intimidate or influence the
             witnesses or interfere with the smooth conduct of the
             investigation in any manner or tamper or attempt to
             tamper the evidence in any manner whatsoever.

If the petitioner violates any of the above said conditions, the

bail granted to him is liable to be cancelled.

      The Bail Application is allowed as above.



                                                                  Sd/-

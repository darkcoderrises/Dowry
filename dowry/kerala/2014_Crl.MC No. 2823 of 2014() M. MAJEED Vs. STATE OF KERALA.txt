                      Criminal M.C. No.2823 of 2014
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 12th day of June, 2014


                                     O R D E R


           This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime

No.411/2014 of Hosdurg police station, Kasaragod District

to quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called 'the Code').

           2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are arrayed as accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime

No.411/2014 of Hosdurg police station of Kasaragod

district, registered on the basis of the statement given by

the 2nd respondent as defacto-complainant, alleging offences

under Section 143, 147, 448, 341, 506(i) read with Section

149 of the Indian Penal Code. In fact there was a counter

case also registered as crime No.408/2014 against the

present defacto-complainant and another and both the

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                                     2

cases have been settled on account of the intervention of

mediators and the counter case is already been quashed by

this court. The defacto-complainant does not want to

prosecute the petitioners any longer in view of the

settlement and no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the investigation as well in view of the settlement.

Since it is in the crime stage, neither the police nor the

court will drop the proceedings, so the petitioners have no

other remedy except to approach this court, seeking the

following reliefs:

             i. Call for entire records in Crime No.411/2014 on
      the file of Hosdurg police station and to quash entire
      proceedings in Crime No.411/2014 for the interest of
      justice.
             ii. Issue any other relief that this Hon'ble High
      Court may due fit to grant in the facts and circumstances
      of the case.

            3.     The     2nd   respondent     appeared     through

counsel and submitted that, in view of the settlement he

does not want to prosecute the petitioners and the counter

case against him has been quashed on the basis of the

settlement by this court. He had filed Annexure-A3 affidavit

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                                 3

stating these facts.

            4.    The counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that, in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served in

continuing with the investigation or trial and so he prayed

for allowing the application.

            5.    The     learned    Public    Prosecutor     on

instructions as directed by this court submitted that, the

petitioners have not involved in any other crime but in the

first information report, it is mentioned that apart from the

present petitioners five other identifiable persons also

involved and opposed the application.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Hosdurg police has

registered a case as Crime No.411/2014 of Hosdurg police

station against the petitioners and five identifiable persons

alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 448, 341, 506(i)

read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and

investigation is in progress. It is also an admitted fact that,

on the basis of the statement given by the first petitioner

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                               4

herein, another crime was registered as Crime No.408/2014

against the present petitioners and others alleging offences

under Sections 341, 447, 506(i) 326, 354 read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal code and that case was settled and

quashed by this court as per order in Crl.M.C.No.2813/2014

dated 27.05.2014. It is seen from the affidavit and order

that both are relatives and the incidents happened due to

some mis-understanding and due to the intervention of

mediators all the disputes between them have been settled

and they have decided to withdraw the prosecution as well.

It is true that apart from the petitioners, involvement of five

identifiable persons have been mentioned in the first

information report. When the entire matter has been

settled, then there is no possibility for the petitioners or the

defacto-complainant co-operating with the investigation for

tracing out the un-identifiable persons as well, who have to

be made parties at the later stage. Since the defacto-

complainant had decided to forgo the prosecution in to-to,

there is no purpose in keeping the investigation in progress

                                       5

as even ultimately final report is filed, they are not going to

support the case of the prosecution and conviction in such

cases will be remote.

             7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                                       6

      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             8.     The dictum laid down in the above decision

is that, in a case where family members were involved and

due to the mis-understanding between the family members,

some crimes have been committed and if ultimately those

crimes were settled and family relationship has been

restored due to the intervention of mediators and other

members of the family, then court must honour such

settlement and quash the proceedings invoking the power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to

bring harmony among the family members, which has been

restored on account of the settlement due to the

intervention of members of the family and others.

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                                 7

            9.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled and counter case has already been quashed by

this court and no purpose will be served by allowing the

investigation to continue or ultimately final report is filed,

conviction in such cases will be remote, this court feels that

it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote the settlement and harmony that

has been restored in the family relationship and the

pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for such

relationship.

            So the application is allowed and further

proceedings in Crime No.411/2014 of Hosdurg police

station, Kasaragod District, as against the petitioners and

other five identifiable persons mentioned therein is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg, to

inform the same to the concerned police station for

Crl. M.C. No.2823 of 2014
                                 8

necessary further action in this regard.

            With the above observation, the petition is

disposed of.

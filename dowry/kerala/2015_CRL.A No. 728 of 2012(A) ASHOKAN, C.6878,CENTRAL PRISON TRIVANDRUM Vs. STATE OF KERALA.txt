                      Crl. Appeal NO.728 of 2012
                     -----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 24th day of February, 2015


                                 JUDGMENT


      The appellant who was tried for the offence under Section 304B

IPC has been convicted of the said offence and sentenced to undergo

rigorous imprisonment for 7 years. The allegation against him is that he

subjected his wife to cruelty demanding more dowry, as a result of which

she committed suicide by consuming a poisonous fruit. The death took

place on 30.4.2007.

      2.    The marriage between the appellant and the victim Suma

Devi was solemnized on 20.10.2002.               There is no dispute that on

29.4.2007 she      consumed a fruit known as '2D{B', which is

poisonous and she died on 30.4.2007. The cause of death is proved by

the evidence of PW14 Dr.Umesh, Ext P5 postmortem certificate issued

by him and Ext.P6 chemical analysis report. The report reveals that the

death was due to toxic glycocide poisoning. The police registered the

case on the basis of Ext P1 statement given by PW1, husband of the

sister of the deceased. The sister of the deceased was examined as

PW2 and her brother as PW3. The prosecution relies on the evidence

Crl. Appeal NO.728 of 2012         2

of PW1 to PW3 to establish its allegation that the appellant subjected

the deceased to cruelty demanding more dowry.         The unchallenged

testimony of PW1 and PW2 prove that when the marriage between the

appellant and Suma Devi was solemnized there was a promise to give

Rs.30,000/- and gold ornaments worth 10 sovereigns as dowry; but she

was given only Rs.30,000/- and gold ornaments worth 6 = sovereigns.

      3.    PW1 to PW3 testified that demanding the balance gold worth

3 = sovereigns the appellant used to assault the deceased. PW3 stated

that demanding more dowry the appellant assaulted the deceased and

she came back to his house. The appellant talked to her on phone and

she went back to his house. This was not met with any challenged in the

cross-examination. It also came out in the evidence of PW2 that the

appellant used to assault the deceased demanding more dowry. She

specifically mentioned that the appellant beat the deceased at the house

of herself (PW2) and PW1 and then PW1 and PW2 undertook to give

gold ornaments worth 3 = sovereigns; the appellant took her back to her

house. In the cross-examination PW2 reiterated this evidence given in

the examination in chief.

      4.    In the cross-examination both PW1 and PW2 said that they

had told the police that the appellant used to assault the deceased

demanding gold ornaments worth 3 = sovereigns. They were asked for

Crl. Appeal NO.728 of 2012            3

an explanation for its absence in the statement given to the police. In

the evidence of PW18, the police officer who recorded the statement of

PW2, it come out that what PW2 told him was that demanding the

balance dowry the deceased assaulted her. Earlier the witness had told

the police officer that the part of the dowry which was not paid was 3 =

sovereigns. So it is very clear that her statement to the police that it was

demanding 3 = sovereigns the appellant assaulted the deceased.

There is no contradiction.     The evidence of PW2 that the appellant

physically assaulted the deceased at her (PW2) house and she and her

husband (PW1) promised to give the balance dowry and the appellant

took the deceased back to his house on that undertaking was not called

into question in the cross-examination.

      5.    Thus there is unchallenged testimony of PW1 and PW2 to

prove that the appellant had assaulted the deceased demanding more

dowry.

      6.    The solemnization of marriage between the appellant and the

deceased was on 20.10.2002.          The deceased committed suicide on

30.4.2007. The death was within 7 years of solemnization of marriage

under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. There is a presumption that it

is a case of dowry death if the prosecution proves that soon before her

death she had been subjected to cruelty by the appellant demanding

Crl. Appeal NO.728 of 2012              4

more dowry. Section 304B is attracted only if the prosecution proves

that the appellant had subjected her to cruelty soon before her death

demanding dowry. In this case there is no evidence to prove the period

during which the appellant subjected the deceased to cruelty.              So

Section 113B Evidence Act is not attracted. For the very same reason

Section 304B IPC also is not attracted.            The conviction cannot be

upheld.

      In the result, this appeal is allowed.           The conviction of the

appellant under Section 304B IPC and the sentence imposed on him for

the said offence are set aside. He is acquitted of the said offences. He

shall be set at liberty forthwith if it his further detention is not necessary

in connection with any other case.

                                                            JUDGE.

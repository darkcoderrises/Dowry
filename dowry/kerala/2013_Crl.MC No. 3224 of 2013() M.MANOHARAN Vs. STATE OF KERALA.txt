             -----------------------------------------------
             Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
            ------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 01st day of August, 2013

                               ORDER

        As the above two M.C.s are arising out of a same crime

and filed by different accused in the very same crime and as

the respondents are same, these M.C.s are heard together and

being disposed of by this common order.

     2.   The prosecution case in brief is that accused Nos.1

to 4 are enimical towards CW.1 on account of an issue relating

to the Muthappan temple, Kanalpalam in Valiyannur amsom

and desom. It is alleged by the prosecution that on account of

this animosity accused 1 to 4 waylaid the de facto complainant

Sreejith near Kanalpalam bus stop when he reached there

driving his tempo van on 03/10/2005 at about 8.15 p.m. and he

was pulled down from the van by A2 who hit on his nose with a

stone and inflicted fracture on his nose bone, which is grievous

in nature and A1, 3 and 4 assaulted him with hands and

thereby voluntarily caused hurt.          It is further alleged that

when CW.2 Santhosh reached the spot on his motor bike and

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                              :-2-:


got down on the spot seeing this incident, accused 1 to 4

assaulted him with hands and voluntarily caused hurt to him

also.  Thus, according to the prosecution, the accused four in

number have committed the offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323 and 326 read with Section 34 of IPC.

     3.   On completing the investigation in Crime No.234 of

2005 of Chakkarakallu Police Station, the police preferred a

report, based on which the trial court took cognizance and

instituted C.C.No.336 of 2005 on the file of the court of the

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thalassery. The case against A1 to

A3 proceeded in the above counter case, which resulted in

Annexure-B judgment by which accused Nos.1 to 3 were found

guilty for the offences punishable under Sections 323 and 341

read with Section 34 of IPC. Accordingly, A1 and A3 were

found guilty only for the offences punishable under Sections

323 and 341 read with Section 34 of IPC and they are

acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 326 of IPC

whereas A2 found guilty for the offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323 and 326 read with Section 34 of IPC.

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                              :-3-:


Challenging the above conviction and sentence imposed as per

Annexure-B, accused Nos.1 to 3 preferred Crl.A.No.369 of

2007 and the same is now pending before the court of

Additional Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II), Thalassery.

     4.   As the case against accused No.4 was split up from

C.C.No.336 of 2005 and instituted separately as C.C.No.228 of

2008 in the very same court and on completing the trial, the

absconded accused i.e., accused No.4 is found guilty as per

Annexure-B judgment produced in Crl.M.C.No.3229 of 2013

whereby he is convicted for all the offences punishable under

Sections 323, 326 and 341 of IPC.      Challenging the above

conviction and sentence, the 4th accused in the very same

crime preferred the appeal which is now pending as

Crl.A.No.556 of 2008 on the file of the court of Additional

Sessions Judge (Ad hoc-II), Thalassery.

     5.   It is the present case of the petitioners, who are

accused in the above crime and the appellants in the above

two appeals, pending before that court, that during the

pendency of the above appeals, the dispute between the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                              :-4-:


petitioners/accused and the appellant and the de facto

complainant and the injured, who are respectively respondent

No.3 in both the above M.C.s are settled. Accordingly, the

second respondent/de facto complainant and 3rd respondent

another injured filed separate affidavits as Annexures D and E

in Crl.M.C.No.3229 of 2013 and affidavits as Annexures E & F

in Crl.M.C.No.3224 of 2013.

     6.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323 and 326

read with Section 34 of IPC which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

contesting respondents, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant and the injured have no further grievance against

the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                                  :-6-:


        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.s can be allowed

granting the reliefs as sought for.

Crl.M.C.Nos.3224 & 3229 of 2013
                              :-7-:


        In the result, Crl.M.C.No.3224 of 2013 is allowed,

quashing Annexure-A charge sheet in Crime No.234 of 2005 of

Chakkarakallu Police Station in Kannur District leading to the

filing of Crl.A.No.369 of 2007 on the file of the Additional

Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II), Thalassery in C.C.No.336 of 2005

of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thalassery.

     Crl.M.C.No.3229 of 2013 is allowed quashing Annexure-A

charge sheet in Crime No.234 of 2005 of Chakkarakallu Police

Station in Kannur District leading to the filing of Crl.A.No.556

of 2008 on the file of the Additional Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II)

Thalassery in C.C.No.228 of 2008 of Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Thalassery.

        Dated this the 20th day of September, 2013

                            ORDER



     This is an application for anticipatory bail filed by

the accused Nos.2 to 4 in crime No.697/2013 of

Kareelakkulangara Police Station under Sec.438 Cr.P.C.

     2. The case of the prosecution in nut shell was that

the 1st accused married the de facto complainant on

27/03/2013 and thereafter they were living together as

husband and wife. while so, on 14/08/2013, the present

petitioners at the instructions and connivance of the 1st

accused, who is working abroad ill-treated the de facto

complainant demanding more dowry and thereby all of

them have committed the offence punishable under

Sec.498(A) read with Sec.34 IPC.

     3. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that

they are not committed the offence and they are innocent

of the same and they are falsely implicated in the case.

     4.  The application was opposed by the learned

B.A.No.5908 of 2013

                            ..2..

Public Prosecutor on the ground that the investigation is

not over.

     5. Heard both sides and peruse the records.

     6. It is seen from the records that the above case

was registered on the basis of the statement given by the

de facto complainant, who is the wife of the 1st accused

before the Police alleging commission of the above said

offence against all accused persons including the

petitioners.    The main allegation is that they have

misappropriated the gold ornaments given and ill-treated

her demanding more dowry. The petitioners 1 and 2 are

aged persons and 3rd petitioner is a lady residing with

her husband. Considering the fact that it is a matrimonial

offence and putting them behind Bar on the allegations

made by the de facto complainant alone will likely to mar

the possibility of settlement later and this may affect the

re-union between the spouses as well, I feel that some

leniency shall be shown in such cases. Further I feel that

the apprehension of the prosecution is that the

B.A.No.5908 of 2013

                              ..3..

investigation is in the     preliminary    stage and their

questioning is required, can be removed by giving

direction to appear before the investigating officer and

that   will  be    sufficient.    Further considering     the

circumstances of the case, there is no necessity of any

custodial interrogation is required in this case. If at all,

their presence is required for interrogation, a condition

incorporating making the presence available so as to

enable the Investigating agency to conduct interrogation

of the petitioners will be sufficient. So, I feel that it is a

fit case where anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioners with the following conditions:

     i)   The petitioners shall surrender before the

Investigating    Officer    on     04/10/2013   and     after

interrogation, if their arrest is required, after recording

their arrest the Investigating Officer shall release them

on bail    on executing a bond for  25,000/- (Rupees

Twenty Five thousand only) each with two solvent

sureties each for the like sum to satisfaction of the

B.A.No.5908 of 2013

                            ..4..

Investigating Officer/respondent as the case may be. If in

the meantime, the petitioners are arrested by the

respondent, he is directed to comply the above direction.

     ii)     The petitioners shall appear before the

Investigating Officer on the last Saturday of every month

between 9 a.m and 10 a.m. till the final report is filed.

     ii)     The petitioners shall appear before the

Investigating Officer for the purpose of interrogation, if

any, required during the course of investigation on

getting notice from the Investigating Officer under

Sec.160 Cr.P.C for that purpose till the final report is

filed.

     iii)   The petitioners shall not leave the State of

Kerala till the investigation is over without getting prior

permission from the Investigating Officer.

     iv)  If   the  petitioners   surrender   before     the

concerned Magistrate Court and move for regular bail,

then the learned Magistrate is directed to release the

petitioners on bail on the same condition as stated above.

B.A.No.5908 of 2013

                           ..5..

     With the above direction, the application is disposed

of.

                                     K.RAMAKRISHNAN,
                                            JUDGE.

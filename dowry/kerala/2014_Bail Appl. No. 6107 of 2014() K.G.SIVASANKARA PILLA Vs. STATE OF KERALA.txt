                         O R D E R

     The petitioners herein, who are the accused nos.2 and

3 in crime No.626/14 of Venmony Police Station, seeks

anticipatory bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C., as they are

apprehending arrest in the above crime.

     2. The allegation raised against the accused in the

above crime is that the marriage between the son of the

petitioners and the de facto complainant was held on

15.7.2013 and 115 sovereigns of gold was given to the de

facto complainant on the date of marriage. However, while

she is residing along with the accused in her matrimonial

home, she was subjected to harassment demanding more

dowry and therefore according to the prosecution the

accused 3 in numbers have committed offence punishable

under section 498 A r/w 34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

                                 2

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that the petitioners are the parents of the 1st accused who is

the husband of the de facto complainant and they are

implicated in the above crime connected with the

matrimonial dispute so as to harass them. On the other

hand, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that no

overtact is alleged against the petitioners. Having regard

to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

according to me, this application can be allowed, however

subject to conditions.

      In the result, this petition is allowed and there will be a

direction that in the event of arrest of the petitioners

connected with Crime No. 626/14 of Venmony Police

Station, they shall be released on bail on each of them

executing a bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent sureties

each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the

Investigating Officer in the above crime and on the

following other conditions :

                                  3

             1)   The petitioners are directed to report before the
             Investigating Officer in the above Crime as and when
             required.

             2)   The   petitioners  shall  co-operate   with   the
             investigation and they shall not interfere with the
             same or attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper
             the evidence.

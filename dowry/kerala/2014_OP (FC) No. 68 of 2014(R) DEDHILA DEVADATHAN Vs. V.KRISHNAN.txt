                    ----------------------------
                    O.P.(F.C) No. 68 of 2014
                     --------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of February 2014.

                            JUDGMENT




HARUN-UL-RASHID, J.




      The interim order in I.A. No. 310/2014 in O.P.No. 675/2011

dated 5.2.2014 on the file of the Family Court, Kollam is under

challenge.    Petitioner is the legally wedded wife          of the

respondent. Their marriage was solemnised on 6.11.2005

according to Hindu rites and customs. Two female children were

born out of their wedlock aged 7 years and 4 years respectively.

   2.   According to the petitioner, the marriage tie was broken

due to the demand for dowry and unbearable harassment and

assault by the respondent.      It is also alleged that petitioner's

gold ornaments and money were misappropriated               by the

respondent. At last she was thrown out of the matrimonial home

on 16.10.2009 during her 2nd pregnancy time by him.

      3. The petitioner   filed two O.Ps before the court below.

One for   divorce and    other for recovery of money and gold

ornaments.    The husband filed petition for restitution of conjugal

O.P.(F.C) No. 68/2014
                                 : 2 :



rights and getting the custody of the two female children. After

completing the formalities, the court below decided to order joint

trial of both cases. The case was posted for trial for so many

dates. PW1 to 4 were examined during this period of one year.

Petitioner's evidence was closed on 24.1.2014.           and the

respondent was examined as RW1 on 3.2.2014. Thereafter the

case was posted for final hearing on 5.2.2014.

       4.     I.A. No. 310/2014 was filed by the wife seeking

permission to examine the mother of the respondent as one of

her witnesses. The learned Judge observed in the order, copy of

which is marked as Ext.P6 that the evidence from both sides are

already closed and posted for final hearing.     It is stated that

more than ample time is given to the petitioner to adduce

evidence     and after closing her evidence, the respondent was

examined and his evidence also closed.    Learned Judge took the

view that there is no good reason to allow the application for

reopening the evidence and permit the petitioner to examine the

witness who was not examined during the period aforementioned.

The fact that the case was stand for trial on so many occasions

would show that there is no bonafides in filing the application at

this distance of time. Petitioner could have examined any of the

O.P.(F.C) No. 68/2014
                                  : 3 :



witnesses by summoning them. The court below found that more

than ample time is given to the petitioner to adduce evidence.

       5.    We find that I.A. 310/2014 was filed without any

justification and lacks bonafides.        We have examined the

materials on record and we find that no sustainable grounds are

made out for interference.

       Accordingly, the O.P.(F.C) stand dismissed.

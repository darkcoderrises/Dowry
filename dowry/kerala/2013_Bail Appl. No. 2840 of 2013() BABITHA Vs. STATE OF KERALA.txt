                                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

            Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

       2.   Petitioner is the 4th accused in Crime No.425/2013 of

Peechi Police Station presently pending investigation for the

offence punishable under Section 304B IPC. Initially, the crime

was registered for the offences under Sections 498A and 306

IPC.

       3.   The first accused is the husband of deceased

Prijitha. A2 and A3 are parents of the first accused. The present

petitioner is the sister of the first accused.

       4.   Deceased Prijitha was given in marriage to the first

accused during October, 2008. It is alleged that she was being

harassed and tortured to the maximum by forcing her to obtain

more dowry and money from her parents. Two children were

born in the wedlock. Finally, the girl, who could not withstand

the harassments, allegedly committed suicide by consuming

BA.No.2840/2013
                                 : 2 :



poison. It is also alleged that she gave poison to the two small

children aged 3 years and 1 year. All the three died.

      5.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

counsel for the de facto complainant and the learned Public

Prosecutor and perused the CD. The contents of the CD, prima

facie, reveal the complicity of A1 to A3.      There are specific

allegations of harassments in detail against them in the records

in the CD. It seems that the girl was tortured to the maximum, in

order to grab some other properties from the parents of the girl.

It seems that anticipatory bail has been granted to A1 to A3.

      6.    All most all the overt acts are alleged against A1 to

A3. Apart from a stray sentence in the statement of the de facto

complainant that the petitioner had also harassed her, no

specific  overt   acts   are   alleged   against   the    petitioner.

Considering the gravity of the offences involved and the present

stage of the investigation, I do not think that this is a fit case in

which anticipatory bail can be granted.       At the same time,

considering the fact that anticipatory bail was granted to A1 to

A3, I am of the view that an opportunity can be granted to the

BA.No.2840/2013
                                   : 3 :



petitioner to surrender before the investigating officer and to co-

operate with the investigation.

      7.    This bail application is dismissed. At the same time,

if so advised, the petitioner may surrender before the

investigating officer within ten days from today and in such case,

the investigating officer can interrogate the petitioner, effect

recovery if any, and conduct the investigation and produce the

petitioner without delay before the concerned Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, where the petitioner can move for bail. In

such case, the learned Magistrate shall pass appropriate orders,

preferably on the same day itself, provided advance notice on

such application has been given to the Assistant Public

Prosecutor also.

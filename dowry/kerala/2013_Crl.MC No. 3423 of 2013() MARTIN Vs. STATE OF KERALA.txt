                ----------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 16th day of August, 2013

                             O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused in Crime No.

730/2012 in C.C.No 4521/2012             of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Chalakudy which is a case instituted upon

the police report [in Crime No. 730/2012 of Koratty

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Sections

497,498(A) and 34 of Indian Penal Code with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings in Crime No.730/2012 of Koratty

Police Station, Thrissur as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that the first

accused married the de facto complainant on 21/09/08 as per

rites and ceremonies prevailing in their community and while

they were residing as husband and wife at the house of the

accused, she has been harassed mentally and physically by

demanding more dowry and the de facto complainant and her

child was neglected by the first petitioner. Thus, according to

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                 2

the de facto complainant, the accused has committed the

offences punishable under Sections 497, 497(A) and 34 of

Indian Penal Code. The further case of the petitioner is that

during the pendency of the above case, both matrimonial and

criminal disputes are settled as per Annexure-A3 agreement

with the de facto complainant who is the second respondent,

who sworn into Annexure-A4 affidavit.        Both the counsel for

the petitioners and the defacto complainant/second respondent

submitted that A2 in CC No.4521/12 is no more. Therefore,

the case against A2 is abated.

            3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

            4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.             Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.




            5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                   3

on the basis of specific instruction received          from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

            6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

            7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 497,498(A) and 34 of

Indian Penal Code, which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                     4

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                    "57. The position that emerges from

            the above discussion can be summarised

            thus:       the power of the High Court in

            quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

            complaint      in exercise   of   its  inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

            power       given to   a  criminal   court   for

            compounding the offences under S.320 of

            the Code.        Inherent power is of wide

            plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

            has to be exercised in accord with the

            guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

            secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

            abuse of the process of any Court. In what

            cases       power  to   quash    the    criminal

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                    5

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim

            have settled their dispute would depend on

            the facts and circumstances of each case

            and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having

            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

            flavour stand on different footing for the

            purposes     of  quashing,  particularly the

            offences      arising    from   commercial,

            financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

            such like transactions or the offences

            arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

            etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

            is basically private or personal in nature

            and the parties have resolved their entire

            dispute.     In this category of cases, High

            Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

            its view, because of the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                     6

            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

            and continuation of criminal case would put

            accused to great oppression and prejudice

            and extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal case

            despite     full and complete settlement and

            compromise with the victim........"

Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court

has held as follows:-

                    "7.     It  is not  in  dispute  that

            matrimonial       disputes  have   been   on

            considerable      increase in  recent  times

            resulting in filing of complaints under

            Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only

            against the husband but also against the

            relatives of the husband. The question is

            when such matters are resolved either by

            the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

            home or by mutual settlement of other

            pending disputes for which both the sides

            approached the High Court and jointly

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                      7

            prayed      for  quashing    of   the   criminal

            proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the

            wife under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C.,

            whether the prayer can be declined on the

            sole ground that since the offences are non-

            compoundable under Section 320 of the

            Code, it would be impermissible for the

            court to quash the criminal proceedings or

            FIR or complaint.

                    8. It is not in dispute that in the case

            on hand subsequent to the filing of the

            criminal complaint under Sections 498A and

            406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the

            Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help

            and intervention of family members, friends

            and well-wishers, the parties concerned

            have amicably settled their differences and

            executed         a     compromise/settlement.

            Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the

            said compromise before the Trial Court with

            a request to place the same on record and

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                    8

            to drop the criminal proceedings against the

            appellants herein. It is also not in dispute

            that in additional to the mutual settlement

            arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife

            has also filed an affidavit stating that she

            did not wish to        pursue the      criminal

            proceedings against the appellants and fully

            supported the contents of the settlement

            deed. It is the grievance of the appellants

            that no only the Trial Court rejected such

            prayer of the parties but also the High

            Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction

            under Section 482 of the Code only on the

            ground that the criminal proceedings relate

            to the offences punishable under Sections

            498A and 406 of IPC which are non-

            compoundable in nature."

                    "12. In our view, it is the duty of the

            Courts to    encourage genuine settlements

            of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when

            the same are on considerable increase.

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                    9

            Even if the offences are non-compoundable,

            if they relate to matrimonial disputes and

            the Court is satisfied that the parties have

            settled the same amicably and without any

            pressure, we hold that for the purpose of

            securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the

            Code would not be a bar to the exercise of

            power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the

            subsequent criminal proceedings.

                    13.  There has been an outburst of

            matrimonial disputes in recent times. The

            institution   of   marriage    occupies    an

            important place and it has an important

            role to play in the society. Therefore, every

            effort should be made in the interest of the

            individuals in order to enable them to settle

            down in life and live peacefully.      If the

            parties ponder over their defaults and

            terminate their disputes amicably by mutual

            agreement instead of fighting it out in a

            Court of law, in order to do complete justice

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                  10

            in the matrimonial matters, the Courts

            should be less hesitant in exercising its

            extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to

            state that the power under Section 482

            should be exercised sparingly and with

            circumspection only when the Court is

            convinced, on the basis of material on

            record, that allowing the proceedings to

            continue would be an abuse of the process

            of the Court or that the ends of justice

            require that the proceedings ought to be

            quashed."

Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this case,

it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings are

initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose among

the parties and both the disputes are now amicably settled

between the parties. According to me, in the light of the facts

and     circumstances     involved  in the  present   case  and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties

Crl.M.C.No. 3423 of 2013
                                    11

to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C.can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

                        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed,

quashing            all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.4521/2012         of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Chalakkudy in Crime No.730/2012                of

Koratty Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

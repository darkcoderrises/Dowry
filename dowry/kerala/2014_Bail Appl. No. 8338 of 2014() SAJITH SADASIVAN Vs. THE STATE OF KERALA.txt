            Dated this the 25th day of November, 2014

                                   ORDER

     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.992/2014 of

the Vallikunnam Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498(A), 323, 294(b) and 506(ii) read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the de-facto

complainant, who is the wife of the petitioner, and treated her with

cruelty by demanding more dowry. It is also alleged that she was

severely beaten up.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor. The crime has been registered on the basis of a

private complaint filed by the de-facto complainant, before the

B.A.8338 of 2014                   2

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kayamkulam, which was

referred to the police for an investigation under Section 156(3) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure. The contents of the C.D. reveals

that the investigation of the case is practically over. No criminal

antecedents have been reported against the petitioner. Considering

the facts and circumstances of the case and the present stage of

investigation, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      5.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge the petitioner on

bail in the event of his arrest on his executing a bond for 25,000/-

(Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each

for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

             (i)  The petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

B.A.8338 of 2014                    3

      all    Fridays  and      Tuesdays,    commencing       from

      28.11.2014 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

             (ii) The petitioner shall not tamper with the

      evidence or influence witnesses.

             (iii) The petitioner shall make himself available

      for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

             (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

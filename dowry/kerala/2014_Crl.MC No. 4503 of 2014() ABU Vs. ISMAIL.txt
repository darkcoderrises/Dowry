                      Crl.M.C.No.4503 of 2014
                      -------------------------------
               Dated this the 11th day of August, 2014.


                              O R D E R

            The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No. 756/2009 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court - I, North Paravur for the offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 452, 423, 323 and 506(ii) r/w Section 149 of

the I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further proceedings in C.C

No.756/2009 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - I, North Paravur as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.  The allegation in the above case is that on 20.11.2009 at

about 5 p.m the petitioners had trespassed into the house of the 1st

respondent demanding amount lost to them in rent a car business and

manhandled the 1st respondent/de facto complainant and respondents 2

to 4, who are his wife, son-in-law and daughter and thus, they have

committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the petitioners

Crl.M.C.No.4503 of 2014
                                     2



is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis

of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the

above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioners and he has no grievance

against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

Crl.M.C.No.4503 of 2014
                                           3



in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

under Sections 143, 147, 452, 423, 323 and 506(ii) r/w 149 of IPC, which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties

to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent,

it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.    In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57.     The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
          in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
          from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
          the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
          wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
          exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
          power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
          abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

Crl.M.C.No.4503 of 2014
                                            4



           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
           case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
           from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or
           such like transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
           where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
           and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
           is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
           put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
           injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite      full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in

the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out

of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have

                                     5



any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings.       Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No. 756/2009 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, North Paravur.

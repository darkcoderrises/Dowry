         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                 Dated this the 29th day of January 2015

                                      ORDER

      Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.     Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.649/2014 of

Kanakakkunu Police Station, Alappuzha district registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

tortured and harassed the de-facto complainant, who is the wife of

the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty, by demanding more

dowry and gold ornaments after misappropriating her entire gold

ornaments and money.

      4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A.165/2015                        2

      5.    No criminal antecedents have been reported against the

petitioners. The investigation of this case is practically over. This

is not a case wherein the custodial interrogation of the petitioners

is required for the continued investigation of the case. Being a

matrimonial offence, considering the possibility of re-union and

settlement, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge the petitioners on

bail in the event of their arrest on each of them executing a bond

for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two

solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the

officer conducting arrest, and subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

B.A.165/2015                        3

      all Thursdays        and Mondays commencing from

      5.2.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii) The petitioners shall not tamper with the

      evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

      available for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.



      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

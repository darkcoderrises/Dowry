                  Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                              ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.266 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.64 of 2012 of Hosdurg Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 447, 341, 323, 294(b), 427

& 506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

entire proceedings against the petitioners in C.C.No.266 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The allegation against the petitioners/accused is

that, they trespassed into the property belongs to the de facto

complainant and assaulted the de facto complainant and

thereby the accused committed the offences punishable under

Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 427 & 506(ii) read with Section 34

Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
                             :-2-:


of IPC. According to the petitioners, during the pendency of

the above case, the entire matter is settled with the 3rd

respondent, who is the de facto complainant as well as with

the respondents 4 and 5, who are the injured.           The 3rd

respondent/de facto complainant has sworn into Annexure-A3

affidavit and similarly respondents 4 and 5, who are the

injured respectively, have sworn into Annexures-A4 and A5

affidavits.

     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 3rd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4.    The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.    The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
                              :-3-:


submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-A3, A4 & A5 affidavits.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

     7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 447, 341, 323, 294

(b), 427 & 506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


made by the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that

the injured and the de facto complainant have no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in

which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

        partnership or such like transactions or the offences

        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

Crl.M.C.No.3903 of 2013
                               :-6-:


resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 F.I.R., Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.64

of 2012 of Hosdurg Police Station and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.266 of 2012 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg.

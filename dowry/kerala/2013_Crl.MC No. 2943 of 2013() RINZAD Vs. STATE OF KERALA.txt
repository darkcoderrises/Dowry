                       Crl.M.C.No. 2943 of 2013
                    ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 18th day of July, 2013

                                 O R D E R

               The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in Crime No.483 of 2013 of the

Kilimanoor Police Station, for the offences punishable under Sections

416,420,468,469 and 471 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR

in Crime No.483/2013 of Kilimanoor Police Station and all further

proceedings as the matter is settled out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the accused in order to

deceive the de facto complainant and to defame her, registered a marriage

on 29.12.2012 under the Special Marriage Act purportedly solemnized

with the de facto complainant by committing impersonation and forgery

and obtained a marriage certificate. Thus, according to the de facto

complainant, the accused has committed the offences punishable under

Sections 416,420,468,469 and 471 of I.P.C.and now, the case of the

Crl.M.C.No.2943 of 2013

                                     :-2-:

petitioner/s is that the matter is settled out of court between the petitioner

himself and the second respondent,who is the de facto complainant.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. The de facto complainant filed Annexure-3 affidavit. Besides the

above, the petitioner has also filed Annexure 2 compromise petition, which

is duly signed by counsel appearing for the petitioner and the respondents.

Crl.M.C.No.2943 of 2013

                                        :-3-:

I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

416,420,468,469 and 471 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioner/ accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

Crl.M.C.No.2943 of 2013

                                           :-4-:

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.No.2943 of 2013

                                      :-5-:

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure I FIR in

Crime No.483/2013 of Kilimanoor Police Station and all further

proceedings thereto.

                                                                   Judge

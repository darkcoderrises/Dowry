          Dated this the 18th day of July, 2013.


                         O R D E R


          The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in

S.C.No.95/12 of the Sessions Court-Kasaragode, which is a

case instituted upon the police report [in Crime No. 436/11

of Chandera Police Station] for the offences punishable

under Section 377 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure A FIR and Annexure B final report in the above

crime, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

17.5.2011 at 2 p.m. as well as on 20.5.2011 at 10.30 p.m.,

the petitioner sexually molested the minor son aged 14

years of the 1st respondent at the room of the petitioner,

while the petitioner was working as a teacher in the

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.2915 of 2013


Madrassa at Kaikottakadavu and thereby the minor son

aged 14, namely Ubaidulla, was subjected to unnatural

offence and now, the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court, as evident from Annexure C

affidavit    sworn     in by the  1st respondent/de    facto

complainant.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.         Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

                                3
Crl.M.C.No.2915 of 2013


de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         6.        I  have carefully considered    the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offence involved

in the above case is only under Section 377 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences

are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further

                                    4
Crl.M.C.No.2915 of 2013


grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)].

In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-




                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal     cases   having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

                                   5
Crl.M.C.No.2915 of 2013


         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute.    In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"



According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

                               6
Crl.M.C.No.2915 of 2013


prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.       Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioner in S.C.No.95/2012 of Sessions Court, Kasaragod,

in Crime No.436/11 of Chandera Police Station.

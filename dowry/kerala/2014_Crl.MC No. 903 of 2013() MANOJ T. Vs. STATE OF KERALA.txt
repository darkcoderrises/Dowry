                     Crl.M.C. No.903 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of February, 2014

                             ORDER

     This petition is filed U/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash Annexure-

A3 final report and all further criminal proceedings in

C.C.No.63/2012 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kannur. The above case was registered by the Kannapuram

Police on the basis of a complaint filed by the 2nd respondent

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur,

which was sent over to the Kannapuram Police for

investigation U/s.156(3) Cr.P.C. After investigation, they filed

a final report before Court.        The allegation is that on

17.6.2007 the petitioner married the 2nd respondent as per

customary rites and thereafter they lived together as

husband and wife till 15.12.2007. While residing together,

the petitioner illtreated the 2nd respondent demanding dowry

Crl.M.C.No.903/10               2

both physically and mentally. After that, on 15.12.2007,

she was ousted from the matrimonial house.           In the

circumstances, she filed Annexure-A1 complaint before

Court.     Aggrieved by that, the petitioner approached this

Court to quash the proceedings by invoking the inherent

jurisdiction.

      2.    Heard both sides.       The learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner contended that the incident

was occurred      between     17.6.2007 and     15.12.2007.

Annexure-A1 complaint was preferred on 1.3.2012 and

Annexure-A2 is the FIR registered on 2.3.2012 by the

Kannapuram Police after receiving Annexure-A1 complaint

from JFCM-I, Kannur. After detailed investigation, a final

report was filed only on 28.3.2012. Thereafter, the Court

took cognizance of the offence.        According to the 2nd

respondent, her marriage was solemnized on 17.6.2007

and thereafter both of them lived together as husband and

wife till 15.12.2007. The incident was occurred during this

period. The last incident was on 15.12.2007, on which

Crl.M.C.No.903/10                 3

date, the petitioner ousted her from matrimonial house.

The complaint was filed after the expiry of the period of

limitation provided U/s.468 Cr.P.C. The trial Court took

cognizance of the offence without considering the

aforesaid provision.        Prima facie no materials are

produced before the trial court to show that any

matrimonial offence was committed by the petitioner

against the 2nd respondent.

      3.    The learned Public Prosecutor admitted that no

petition for condoning the delay was filed along with the

complaint. When the final report was filed before the trial

court, it is the responsibility of the learned Magistrate to

consider the aforesaid period of limitation provided

U/s.468 Cr.P.C. Hence, he prays to remit the matter to the

trial court.

      4.    The inherent jurisdiction to interfere in criminal

proceedings is mentioned U/s.482 Cr.P.C. for three

grounds.      Inherent jurisdiction can be invoked to make

such orders necessary to "give effect to any order" under

Crl.M.C.No.903/10                  4

this code or to prevent "abuse of the process" of any court

or to secure "the ends of justice". While considering the

facts mentioned in the petition, there is a duty from the

side of Court to verify the materials placed before it to

invoke the inherent jurisdiction. The Apex Court in State

of Haryana V. Bhajanlal, held as follows: [1992 SCC 9 (Crl)

426]

               "where the allegations made in the FIR or
        complaint    are   so   absurd   and   inherently
        improbable on the basis of which no prudent
        person can ever reach a just conclusion that
        there is sufficient ground for proceeding against
        the accused, the proceedings are liable to be
        quashed".

      5.    The facts of the case show that the learned

Magistrate took cognizance of the offence on 12.9.2012

and issued summons to the petitioner and on the basis of

that summons, the petitioner appeared before the trial

Court. But, the learned Magistrate has not considered the

bar to take cognizance of the offence, after the expiry of

the limitation period mentioned U/s.468 Cr.P.C.          Section

468 Cr.P.C. reads as follows:

Crl.M.C.No.903/10                    5

            "468. Bar to taking cognizance after lapse of
            the period of limitation.- (1) Except as
            otherwise provided elsewhere in this Code, no
            court, shall take cognizance of an offence of
            the category specified in sub-section (2), after
            the expiry of the period of limitation.
            (2) The period of limitation shall be-
            (a) six months, if the offence is punishable
            with fine only;
            (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with
            imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
            year;
            (c) three years, if the offence is punishable
            with imprisonment for a term exceeding one
            year but not exceeding three years.
            (3). For the purpose of this section, the period
            of limitation, in relation to offences which may
            be tried together, shall be determined with
            reference to the offence which is punishable
            with the more severe punishment or, as the
            case may be, the most severe punishment."


The     offence      U/s.498A        shall    be   punished  with

imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years

and shall also be liable to fine. The language of sub-

section (3) of section 468 makes it imperative that the

limitation provided for taking cognizance in Section 468 is

in respect of offence charged. Therefore, before taking

cognizance of the offence, the learned Magistrate has

responsibility to ascertain the specific period. The Apex

Court in Venkappa Gurappa Hosur v. Kasawwa [(1997) 4 SC

Crl.M.C.No.903/10                6

217] held that once the limitation has begun to run, it runs

its full course. I have verified Annexure-A1 complaint. No

reasons are stated by the defacto complainant in the trial

court to condone the delay. Section 473 Cr.P.C. says that

even after the expiry of the period of limitation, the Court

can take cognizance of the offence, if it is satisfied on the

facts and in the circumstances of the case that the delay

has been properly explained or it is necessary to do so in

the interests of justice. Such request was also not made

in the trial court.     The petitioner contended that his

marriage with the 2nd respondent was divorced on

25.4.2011 as per Annexure-A9 judgment of the Family

Court, Kasaragod. If that be the position, further trial of

the case in J.F.C.M-I, Kannur amounts to a mere abuse of

process of the Court. The Apex Court in Krishnan and

another v. Krishnaveni and another [AIR 1997 SC 987] held

that: "When the High Court on examination of the record finds

that there is grave miscarriage of justice or abuse of process of

the Courts or the required statutory procedure has not been

Crl.M.C.No.903/10                7

complied with or there is failure of justice or order passed or

sentence imposed by the Magistrate requires correction, it is but

the duty of the High Court to have it corrected at the inception lest

grave miscarriage of justice would ensue. It is therefore, to meet

the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process that the

High Court is preserved with inherent power and would be

justified, under such circumstances, to exercise the inherent

power and in an appropriate case."

       6.   Accepting the above legal principle, I am of the

view that this a fit case to invoke the inherent jurisdiction

U/s.482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, Annexures-A1, A2 and A3

are liable to be quashed and I do so.

       Crl.M.C. is allowed as above.

                  -----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                                ORDER

      Petitioners are the accused in C.C. No.2112 of 2013 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Kasaragod.

They are alleged to have the offences under Sections 354,

406, 498A and 506 IPC. It is submitted that the matter has

been settled between the parties and the proceedings in the

criminal case may be quashed.

      2.    Heard.

      3.    The first petitioner was the husband              of the 2nd

respondent. They were married on 21.7.2011. They have no

issues. The 2nd petitioner is the mother and the 3rd and 4th

petitioners are the brothers and the 5th petitioner is the sister

of the 1st petitioner. It is alleged that they subjected to the

defacto complainant to cruelty demanding more dowry and

misappropriated her properties and threatened to cause her

death. The defacto complainant who is the 2nd respondent in

this case has entered appearance through a counsel and filed

an affidavit to the effect that the matter has been settled and

she has no complaints against the petitioners. Since this is a

family matter, I am of the view that it is only proper that the

proceeding in the criminal case are quashed.

CRL.M.C. No.3208 OF 2014  2

    In the result      this Criminal M.C. is allowed and the

proceedings in C.C. No.2112 of 2013 of the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate are quashed.

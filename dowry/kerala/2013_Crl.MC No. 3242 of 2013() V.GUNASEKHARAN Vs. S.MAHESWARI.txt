          ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 2nd day of August, 2013

                           O R D E R

      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.No.889/2012 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Palakkad which is a

case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Sections 498 A r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. with

a prayer to quash Annexure A final report and all further

proceedings pursuant thereto in C.C.No.889/2012 on the files

of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Palakkad as the matter

is settled out of court.

         2.   The prosecution allegation in the aforesaid case

that the accused who are the husband and mother-in-law of

the defacto complainant, subjected her to both physical and

mental cruelties demanding more money. Therefore the

prosecution    case   is  that   the petitioners/accused  have

committed the offence punishable under Section 498 A r/w

Section 34 of IPC. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled amicably between the first petitioner and the

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                2

first respondent who are husband and wife and they are

residing together and leading a peaceful marital life. Annexure-

B is the affidavit sworn into by the defaco complainant who is

the first respondent.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                    3

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Section 498 A r/w Section 34 of

IPC, which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the first

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioner accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them.             In this juncture, it is

relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court,              in the

decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v.

Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)],

has held as follows:-

               "7.   It is not in dispute that matrimonial

         disputes have been on considerable increase in

         recent times resulting in filing of complaints under

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                    4

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against

         the husband but also against the relatives of the

         husband. The question is when such matters are

         resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the

         matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

         pending    disputes  for   which   both   the   sides

         approached the High Court and jointly prayed for

         quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or

         complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406

         of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the

         sole ground that since the offences are non-

         compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

         would be impermissible for the court to quash the

         criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on

         hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal

         complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,

         1961, with the help and intervention of family

         members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences

         and executed a compromise/settlement. Pursuant

         thereto, the appellants filed the said compromise

         before the Trial Court with a request to place the

         same    on   record  and    to  drop   the   criminal

         proceedings against the appellants herein.      It is

         also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual

         settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-

         wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she did

         not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of

         the settlement deed.     It is the grievance of the

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                     5

         appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such

         prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed

         toe exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of

         the Code only on the ground that the criminal

         proceedings relate to the offences punishable under

         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-

         compoundable in nature."

                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts

         to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial

         disputes, particularly, when the same are on

         considerable increase.     Even if the offences are

         non-compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial

         disputes and the Court is satisfied that the parties

         have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing

         ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not

         be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing of

         FIR,   complaint    or   the   subsequent     criminal

         proceedings.

                   13.    There has been an outburst of

         matrimonial    disputes   in  recent  times.      The

         institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society.

         Therefore, every effort should be made in the

         interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully.     If the

         parties ponder over their defaults and terminate

         their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order

         to do complete justice in the matrimonial matters,

         the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

         extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                   6

         the power under Section 482 should be exercised

         sparingly and with circumspection only when the

         Court is convinced, on the basis of material on

         record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or

         that  the   ends   of  justice require  that  the

         proceedings ought to be quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

Crl.M.C.No.3242 of 2013
                                7

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A final report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.889/2012 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Palakkad.

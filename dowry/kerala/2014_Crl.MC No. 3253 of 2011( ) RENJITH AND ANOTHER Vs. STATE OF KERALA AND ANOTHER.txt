            ------------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C No.3253 of 2011
            ------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 30th day of June, 2014.

                             O R D E R


           Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Petitioners

are accused in C.C No.1146/2011 pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Karungappally.

      2.   Facts in brief, are as follows :

       Chavara Police Station registered Crime No.745/2011

under Section 498A r/w Section 34 IPC on the allegation made

by the second and the third respondents that the first petitioner

married the second respondent and during their marital life, the

petitioners made the second respondent's life miserable by

harassing her physically and mentally. Annexure V is the first

information report and the first information statement in this

case. Annexure IX is the final report filed by the police after

investigation.

      3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned counsel for the respondents. I have perused the records.

Crl.M.C No.3253 of 2011            2



      4.      Specific case of the complainants/respondents is that

the accused married the second respondent on 11/11/2010. It is

submitted by the learned counsel for the second and third

respondents that the marriage was registered with S.N.D.P.

Yogam. In Annexure V clear allegations are made that the

petitioners together harassed the second respondent demanding

more dowry and money.

      5.      Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the

first petitioner never married the second respondent. It is an

admitted fact, according to the learned counsel, that there was a

betrothal ceremony between the first petitioner and the second

respondent on 27-10-2010. However, no marriage took place

thereafter, contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

It is also submitted that second respondent actually married one

Shailesh. Annexure VII is the invitation letter for the marriage

between the second respondent and Shailesh . It is seen from

Annexure VII that they married on 19-04-2012. It is submitted

Crl.M.C No.3253 of 2011          3



by the learned counsel for the petitioners that an issue is born in

the relationship. Annexure VIII is the marriage certificate

produced to show that the second respondent was married to

Shailesh on 19-04-2012. Learned counsel for the second and

third respondents has no case that this marriage took place after

dissolving the marriage of the second respondent with the first

petitioner. This probabilises the case of the petitioners that there

was no marriage between the first petitioner and the second

respondent. Learned counsel produced a copy of the judgment

of Family Court, Chavara in O.P(HMA) No.1350/2013. That

was a case filed by the first petitioner against the second

respondent and her husband Shailesh. On perusal of the

judgment, it can be seen that though the respondents entered

appearance and filed objection before the Family Court, later

they did not turn up and they were set ex parte. The Family

Court, after considering the evidence produced before it,

allowed the original petition declaring that there was no marital

Crl.M.C No.3253 of 2011           4



relationship between the first petitioner and the second

respondent. Reckoning all these facts, I find that the prosecution

against the petitioners in Crime No.745/2011 is an abuse of the

process of the court. Therefore, the power of this Court under

Section 482 Cr.P.C has to be invoked in this case.

              In the result, Annexure V first information report and

first information statement and Annexure IX final report are

hereby quashed.

      All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.

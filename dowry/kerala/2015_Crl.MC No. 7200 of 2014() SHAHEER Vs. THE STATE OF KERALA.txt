                  CRL. M.C. No.7200 of 2014
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 27th day of January, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A7 in Crime No.1269/14 of the

Perumbavoor Police Station, Ernakulam registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting all further proceedings in

Crime No No.1269/14 of the Perumbavoor Police Station,

Ernakulam, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.No.7200 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



more    dowry,      after misappropriating her    entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,  who     is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.7200 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings        based on    Crime    No.1269/14    of   the

Perumbavoor Police       Station, Ernakulam, are       hereby

quashed.

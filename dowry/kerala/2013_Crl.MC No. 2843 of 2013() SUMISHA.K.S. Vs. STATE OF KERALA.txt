                               ORDER


          This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure seeking for a direction to

respondents 2 and 3 to conduct proper investigation in

Annexure A1 FIR and Annexure A2 complaint and file an final

report.

          2. The petitioner is the defacto complaint in Crime

No. 670 of 2013 of Munambam Police Station. The grievance

of the petitioner is that no proper investigation is being

conducted and offences that are actually committed are not

being incorporated. It is pointed out that offences under the

Information Technology Act were deliberately omitted with

ulterior motive. The further complaint is that the petitioner

has filed Annexure II complaint before the third respondent

and no action has been taken on the said complaint.

Therefore, it is contended that an investigation that is being

Crl.M.C.2843/2013.               2

conducted is not proper and a direction to that effect may be

made.

             3.   A detailed statement has been filed by the

second respondent in which steps taken during investigation

is made mention of. It is also pointed out that provisions

under     the      Information   Technology  Act  have   been

incorporated.      In paragraphs 4 and 5 there is a specific

averment to this effect. It is pointed out that the petitioner

was questioned in Crime No. 670 of 2013 and she had no

grievance regarding the dowry harassment.       Therefore, no

steps were taken in that regard.

             4.   The petitioner has no case in the complaint

which resulted in registration of Crime No.670 of 2013

regarding dowry harassment. Her complaint is that she had

filed a complaint in which no action is taken. Of course, the

provisions of Dowry Prohibition Act do not form subject matter

Crl.M.C.2843/2013.              3

of Crime No. 670 of 2013 which is a different cause of action

altogether.

             5. However, if the petitioner has moved Annexure

A2 petition, as claimed, before the third respondent, he is

bound to take steps in accordance with law.

             Therefore, this petition is disposed of with a

direction to the third respondent to consider and take a

decision on Annexue A2 in accordance with law as

expeditiously as possible.




                                            P. BHAVADASAN,
                                                 JUDGE

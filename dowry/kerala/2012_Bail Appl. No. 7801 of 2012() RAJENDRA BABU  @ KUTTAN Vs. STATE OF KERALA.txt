                      B.A. No. 7801 of 2012
                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
           Dated this the 19th day of October, 2012.

                                  ORDER



          Petitioner stands accused of having committed

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 I.P.C.

          2. The allegation against the petitioner is that the

petitioner ill-treated his wife and tortured her mentally and

physically demanding more dowry and ultimately, she

committed suicide on 5.9.2012 by hanging.

          3. Petitioner points out that he is innocent and

has been falsely implicated with ulterior motive.                 He has

been in custody from 13.9.2012 onwards. According to the

petitioner, his continued custody is necessary. He therefore

seeks bail.

          4.     Learned Public Prosecutor submits that the

investigation is not yet complete.

          5. No doubt the allegations against the petitioner

are serious in nature.          But he has been in custody from

B.A.7801/12.                      2

13.9.2012 onwards and a good part of the investigation

must have been completed by now.                   There is no

apprehension expressed by the investigating agency that if

released on bail, the petitioner is likely to abscond. In such

circumstances, it is felt that it is unnecessary to continue the

custody of the petitioner.

             Therefore, this    application is allowed  and the

petitioner is released on bail on the following conditions:

      i) Petitioner shall execute a bond for a sum of

      Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only)

      with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to

      the satisfaction of JFCM-II, Kollam.


      ii) The learned Magistrate may ensure the identity

      of the sureties and also the veracity of the tax

      receipts that are sought to be produced at the time

      of executing the bond.


      iii)   Petitioner shall report before the Investigating

      Officer on every Friday between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.

      till final report is laid.

B.A.7801/12.                   3



      iv)   Petitioner shall not    tamper or attempt to

      tamper with the evidence or influence or try to

      influence the witnesses.


      v) If any of the condition is violated, bail granted to

      the petitioner shall stand cancelled, and the JFCM

      concerned, on being satisfied of the said fact, may

      take such steps as are available to him in law.




                                             P. BHAVADASAN,
                                                   JUDGE

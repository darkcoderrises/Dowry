           ============================
                   Crl.M.C.No.2213 of 2014
           ============================
              Dated this the 6th day of November, 2015

                              ORDER


      The petitioners herein are the original accused Nos.3

and 4 in C.C.No.1155 of 2004 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Kochi involving the offence under Section

498(A) IPC. The other accused Nos.1, 2 and 5 faced trial

before the learned Magistrate in C.C.No.1155 of 2004. On

trial, the learned Magistrate found the first accused guilty,

but found the accused Nos.2 and 5 not guilty. Accordingly,

the accused Nos. 2 and 5 were acquitted under Section 248

(1) Cr.P.C., and the first accused was convicted under Section

498A    IPC.   He   was     sentenced     to  undergo  rigorous

imprisonment for two years, and to pay a fine amount of

10,000/-. The case against the petitioners herein was split

up and refiled as C.C.No.1064 of 2008. The aggrieved first

Crl.M.C.No.2213 of 2014                 2

accused preferred appeal before the Court of Session,

Ernakulam as Crl.Appeal No.3 of 2009. In appeal, the learned

Sixth Additional Sessions Judge, Ernakulam found the first

accused not guilty. Accordingly, the conviction against him

was set aside, and he was acquitted in appeal.                     Now the

petitioners seek orders quashing the prosecution as against

them on the ground that the main witnesses including the

defacto complainant have not given any evidence against

them at the first round of trial, and that the very substratum

of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the acquittal of

the first accused by the appellate court.

        2.      On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the

Annexure A4 and A5 judgments, I find that continuance of

present prosecution against these petitioners will not serve

any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the trial

court. As regards the first accused, who stands acquitted in

appeal, the learned appellate Judge found thus in Paragraph

9 of the Annexure A5 judgment.

                       "9. xxxxxx A specific incident spoken was

               about    the  incident allegedly   took   place  on

               10.03.2003 and that was the day she was kept out of

               the house with the child and thereafter the accused

               did not care to maintain the wife and child. xxxxxx

Crl.M.C.No.2213 of 2014                  3

               No evidence is there before court to come to the

               conclusion that the appellant had harassed her to

               meet any unlawful demand for in dowry and that was

               even after fathering a child. Hence I hold that the

               prosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubt

               that    accused  had   subjected    PW2   to  cruelty

               warranting a conviction u/s.492(A) IPC. xxxxxx"




        3.      The Annexure A4 judgment shows that the

evidence given by the material witnesses including the

defacto complainant examined as PW2 is mainly against the

first accused. As regards the complainant's case against the

accused Nos.2 and 3, the learned Magistrate found thus in

Paragraph 14 of the Annexure A4 judgment.

                       "14.  xxxxxx On going through her testimony, no

              incident was spoken by her. A mere allegation does not

              suffice the purpose.   The incident ought to have been

              spoken. Though there was no proper cross examination

              to challenge this aspect, court need not embark upon the

              same, on seeing, there is circumstances that it projects to

              be artificial. Therefore the available are not adequate to

              prove that accused No:2 to 5 committed any cruelty upon

              PW2 either physically or mentally."




        4.      The accused Nos.2 and 3 were arraigned as

accused, as persons who prompted the first accused to

commit acts of cruelty. But the learned Magistrate found that

those allegations are not substantiated by evidence, and that

Crl.M.C.No.2213 of 2014                 4

the accused Nos.2 and 3 cannot be found guilty. As regards

the evidence given by the defacto complainant(PW2), the

learned Magistrate found thus in Paragraph 13 of the

Annexure A4 judgment.

                       "13.  xxxxxx Therefore her testimony itself would

                prove that the 1st accused used to beat her after

                consuming alcohol and she was sent out of his house to

                take Rs.25,000/- from her house as dowry for his personal

                needs.  Thus testimony of PW2 would prove that the

                accused committed cruelty against her for his unlawful

                demands."




        5.      This finding shows that her evidence is mainly

against the first accused, and not against the others. There

is reason to believe that the in-laws were unnecessarily or

baselessly arraigned as accused in her complaint. Her main

grievance was against the first accused, but he stands

acquitted by the appellate court on merits. On a perusal of

the two judgments, I find that the prosecution, or the defacto

complainant, cannot improve the case at the second round,

when it goes to trial against these petitioners. I find that the

substratum of the prosecution case, which is practically and

mainly against the first accused, stands lost by the acquittal

of the first accused.             I am well satisfied that no definite

Crl.M.C.No.2213 of 2014            5

evidence was given by the defacto complainant against the

other accused. Definite, it is, that she cannot improve the

case against these petitioners, when the case against them

goes to trial.

        In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution

against the petitioners in C.C.No.1064 of 2008 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kochi will stand quashed under

Section 482 Cr.P.C.

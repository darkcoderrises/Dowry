                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013.


                         O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the 4th accused in Crime

No.340/2001 of Thaliparamba Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

307 r/w 149 of I.P.C. and u/s.3 & 5 of Explosive Substances

Act, with a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR and police

charge and all further proceedings in L.P.C.209/2006 in

C.P.No.162/2006 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate court, Thaliparamba, as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2. The case of the petitioner, who is the 4th accused

in Crime No.340/01 of Thaliparamba police station, is that

the other accused in the very same crime faced the

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                               2

prosecution and as per Annexure II judgment, they are

acquitted and the petitioner is entitled to get the benefit of

that judgment. It is also the case of the petitioner that

after the registration of the crime, the entire dispute is

settled with the 1st respondent who is the de facto

complainant and therefore no purpose would be served

even if the petitioner is ready to face the trial. Therefore,

the present M.C. is filed under section 482 of Cr.P.C. with

a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR and police charge and all

further poceedings pending against the petitioner in

L.P.C.No.209 of 2006 in C.P.No.162/06 on the file of the

court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-Thaliparamba.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.     The prosecution case in brief is as follows :

Accused are the workers of Communist Marxist Party and

PW1 is a worker of Congress party. On account of political

enemity, on 18.7.2001 at about 7.30 p.m. all te accused

formed themselves into an unlawful assembly with deadly

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                               3

weapons like bomb at Therandy in Koovery village.

Thereafter all the accused wrongfully restrained PW1 who

was walking along the Chudala-Therandy Kudavu road.

Thereafter 1st accused threw a bomb at the left side of the

forehead of PW1 and he sustained injury due to the

explosion of the said bomb.        It is alleged that all the

accused did the above acts in prosecution of their common

object to commit murder of PW1. Thereby the accused

committed the above said offences. Thus according to the

prosecution, the accused in the above crime committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

307 r/w 149 of I.P.C. and u/s.3 & 5 of Explosive Substances

Act.

         5. In the light of the claim of the petitioner and in

view of the submission made by the counsel for the

petitioner, I have perused Annexure II judgment.          The

learned Judge who undertook the trial in S.C.No.702/06,

particularly in paragraph 5 of Annexure II judgment, found

that PW1 who launched Ext.P1 FI statement could not

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                                4

identify the person who throw bomb at him as there was

darkness. Pws.2 to 6, the eye witnesses, have also gave

evidence       not     supporting  the   prosecution  case.

Consequently,         the learned  Public  Prosecutor  who

conducted the trial in the trial court, given up the

remaining witnesses. In the light of the above facts and

circumstances involved in the case, the learned Sessions

Judge found that the prosecution has failed to prove the

offences alleged against the accused. It is also relevant to

note that the de facto complainant had sworn into

Annexure III affidavit stating that he has no objection in

dropping the proceedings against the petitioner, as the

entire dispute is settled out of court.

         6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

                              5

         7. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received     from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against him.

         8.       I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 143,

147, 148, 341, 307 r/w 149 of I.P.C. and u/s.3 & 5 of

Explosive Substances Act, which are more or less personal

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                                    6

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what     cases power     to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                                    7

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According        to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case.         According to me, as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

Crl.M.C.No.3620 of 2013
                                  8

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I FIR and all further proceedings pending

against       the      petitioner    in  L.P.C.209/2006    in

C.P.No.162/2006 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate court, Thaliparamba, in Crime No.340 of 2001

of Thaliparamba Police Station.

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                  Dated this the 8th day of April 2015

                                     ORDER


     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.     Petitioners are accused Nos.2 and 3 in Crime

No.265/2015 of Ponnani Police Station pending investigation for

the offences punishable under Sections 308, 354, 406 and 498A

read with Section 34 I.P. C.

     3.     The allegation against the petitioners and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is the wife of A1, and treated her with cruelty,

by demanding more dowry and also by complaining that she was

not fair enough to be the wife of A1. It is also alleged that on

20.2.2015 at 11.30 p.m., A2, who is the father-in-law of the

B.A.1683/2015                     2

defacto complainant dragged her down from the stair-case and A3,

who is her mother-in-law, poured kerosene on her. It is alleged that

as and when A2 went for taking the matchbox to ignite her, she

went out of the house along with her child.

      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     It seems that the wound certificate reveals that there

was smell of kerosene on the body of the defacto complainant. At

the same time, no injuries were found on the body of the defacto

complainant. The learned counsel for the petitioners has pointed

out that the story regarding the pouring of kerosene on her is a

cooked up story made up by the father of the defacto complainant,

who is a retired Police Officer. It has also been pointed out that the

case of the defacto complainant is that after the pouring kerosene

on her body by A3, A2 went inside the house for taking the

matchbox and it was at that time she went out of the house, along

B.A.1683/2015                       3

with her child. It seems that there is some improbability in the case

as pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The

petitioners are aged persons, who are the father-in-law and mother-

in-law of the defacto complainant. It seems that A4, A5 and A6

have been granted anticipatory bail. Considering the facts and

circumstances of this case, I do not think that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is required for the continued

investigation of the case. Matters being so, I am of the view that

this is a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioners.

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge the petitioners on

bail in the event of their arrest on each of them executing a bond

for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent

sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer

B.A.1683/2015                        4

conducting arrest, and         subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

      Wednesdays and Saturdays, commencing from 15.4.2015

      for a period of three months or till the filing of the final

      report in this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with the

      evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The     petitioners  shall    make  themselves

      available for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

     ==============================
                     B.A.No.909 of 2014
     ==============================
       Dated this, the 07th day of February, 2014.


                            O R D E R

      This is an application for anticipatory bail filed by the

accused Nos. 1 to 5 in Crime No.107/14 of Hosdurg Police

Station under Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    The case of the prosecution was that first accused

married the de facto complainant on 06.03.2011 and thereafter

these accused persons harassed her both physically and mentally

and threatened her demanding more dowry and thereby all of

them    have    committed    the   offence     punishable    under

Sections.498A, 323, 506(1), read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code. The Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioners have not committed any offence and they are

innocent of the same and they have been falsely implicated in

the case. Petitioners 2 to 5 are the mother and siblings of the

first petitioner and they have been implicated only to harass

them. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that they

are prepared to abide by any condition imposed by this court.

      3.    The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor

on the ground that the investigation is in the preliminary stage.

B.A.No.909 of 2014           :  2 :

      4.     Heard both sides and perused the case diary file

produced.

      5.     It is seen from the case diary file that the above case

was registered on the basis of a private complaint filed by the de

facto complainant against the petitioners alleging offences under

Sections.498A, 323, 506(1), read with Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg

which was forwarded to the police for investigation by the

learned magistrate under Section 156(3) of Code of Criminal

Procedure. On receipt of the complaint, the Hosdurg police has

registered a case as Crime No.107/14 under Section 498A, 323,

506(1), read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Though, it

was alleged in the complaint that she has been assaulted but no

document has been produced by the de facto complainant along

with the complaint to substantiate the same. However, I am not

going to that question at this stage or not expressing any

opinion regarding the genuineness of the allegations made in the

complaint.       The second petitioner is aged 62 years and

petitioners 4 and 5 are ladies.        Considering the nature of

allegations made, the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is

not required in connection with the investigation.               So,

considering the circumstances, I feel that anticipatory bail can be

B.A.No.909 of 2014                 :    3 :

granted to the petitioners in the event of their arrest in

connection with the above crime with some conditions. So, the

application is allowed with the following conditions:

         1.      The respondent is directed to release the petitioners on

  bail in the event of their arrest in connection with Crime No.107/14 of

  Hosdurg Police Station on executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- each with

  two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the

  arresting officer/investigating officer/respondent as the case may be.

         2.      That the petitioners shall appear before the investigating

  officer for the purpose of interrogation for two consecutive days

  between 9 a.m and 12 noon immediately after their arrest and release

  and thereafter as and when required by him for this purpose in writing

  to do so till the final report is filed.


         3.      That the petitioners shall appear before the investigating

  officer on the last Saturday of every month between 9.00 a.m and

  10.00 a.m till the final report is is filed.


          4.     The petitioners shall not intimidate or influence the

  witnesses.

          5.     The petitioners shall not leave State of Kerala without

  getting prior permission from the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

  Hosdurg till the disposal of the case.

          6.     The petitioners are directed to surrender their passport

  either before the investigating officer or before the court where they

  surrender and move for regular bail on their surrender and if they do

  not have any passport, they are directed to file an affidavit to that

  effect before the authorities mentioned above.

          7.     If the petitioners surrender before the Judicial First Class

  Magistrate Court, Hosdurg No-I or the concerned magistrate court

  and moves for regular bail, then the learned magistrate is directed to

  release the petitioners on bail on the same conditions as stated above.

      With the above conditions, the application is allowed.

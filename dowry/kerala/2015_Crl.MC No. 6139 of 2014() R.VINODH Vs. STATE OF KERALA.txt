                   CRL. M.C. No.6139 of 2014
           ...............................................................
           Dated this the 16th day of February, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioner is first accused in Crime No.324/2011 of the

Parassala Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A, 294(b) read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-II final report in

Crime No.324/2011 of the Parassala Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.711/2011 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,

Neyyattinkara, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

along with the other accused, have tortured and harassed

CRL.M.C.No.6139 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



the defacto complainant, who is his wife, and treated her

with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by

demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,    who   is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

CRL.M.C.No.6139 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-II

final report in Crime No.324/2011 of the Parassala Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.711/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Neyyattinkara, are hereby quashed.

             Dated this the 11th day of July, 2014

                               O R D E R

      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      The petitioners are the accused in crime No.584/2014

of Kattoor Police Station, Thrissur District which has been

registered for the offences under Sections 406, 498A r/w

Section 34 of IPC. The first petitioner is the husband of the

first informant and the other petitioners are his parents.

      2.   It is alleged that the petitioners misappropriated

the first informant's money and gold ornaments. That apart,

demanding more dowry they subjected her to cruelty.

      3.   The defence version is that the first petitioner

filed an application for restitution of conjugal rights and on

account of this enmity the first informant got this false case

registered.

      4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   In the Family Court, Thiruvalla the first petitioner

B.A. No.5075 of 2014
                                -2-

filed O.P.(HMA) No.94/2014 on 07.03.2014 against the first

informant for restitution of conjugal rights. They have been

married for two years. They have no children. The first

informant was working abroad and the first petitioner in

Bangalore. After three months of filing of the O.P. in the

Family Court, the first informant got this case registered.

There is no allegation that any of the petitioners inflicted

any serious injury to the first informant. It appears that

reconciliation is not impossible. If the petitioners happen to

be detained, it may become impossible. Moreover, from the

nature of the allegations, I am of the view that custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is not necessary.

      In the result, this application is allowed.

     1)   The petitioners shall be released on bail on their

          executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty

          five thousand only) each with two solvent sureties

          each for the like sum if they are arrested by the

          Police in connection with this case.

     2)   They shall appear before the Investigating Officer

B.A. No.5075 of 2014
                                -3-

          for interrogation if they are so required by him in

          writing.

     3)   They shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

     4)   They shall not harass the defacto complainant or

          her relatives.

     5)   This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose

          to surrender before the Magistrate concerned and

          in such case the learned Magistrate may take

          appropriate action in accordance with the law.

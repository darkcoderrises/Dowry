                       B.A.No.2335 of 2009
                   ------------------------------------------
               Dated, this the 5th    day of May, 2009

                              ORDER

             This is an application filed under Section 439 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. Petitioner is the first accused in

Crime No.147 of 2009 of Kunnicode Police Station.              The

allegation is that the petitioner has committed offences

punishable under 498A ands 304B read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. In connection with the above said crime

petitioner was taken into custody on 1.4.2009 and since then

he is in judicial custody. According to the petitioner, his wife

has committed suicide on account of mental strain.             But

according to the prosecution, the petitioner has harassed his

wife demanding more dowry and that led to the commission of

suicide.

           2.     I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

Considering the fact that the petitioner has been in custody

from 1.4.2009 and that major part of the investigation has

already been completed, I think no prejudice will be caused to

the investigation, if the petitioner is released on bail subject to

B.A.No.2335 of 2009
                                      2

conditions.

             3. Accordingly this application is allowed subject to

the following conditions:

             i) Petitioner shall be released on bail on his

executing a bond for Rs.25000/- with two solvent sureties for

the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial I Class

Magistrate-III, Punalur.

             ii)  Petitioner shall report before the investigating

officer once in a week on all Mondays between 10 a.m. and

11a.m. till the final report is laid.

             iii) Petitioner shall not tamper with or attempt to

tamper with evidence or intimidate or influence or attempt to

intimidate or influence the witnesses.

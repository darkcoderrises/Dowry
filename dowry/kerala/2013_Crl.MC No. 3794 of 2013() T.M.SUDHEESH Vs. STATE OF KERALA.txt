                 -------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.3794 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013.


                         O R D E R


     The petitioners are accused in C.C.No.508/10 on the

file of the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Payyanur, which is a case instituted upon the report in

Transfer FIR No.608/09 of Payyannur police station,

wherein the offence alleged against the petitioners/accused

are under section 498 A of IPC.               According to the

petitioners, there is no progress in the trial and therefore

the present M.C. is filed with the following prayers : "To

direct the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-

Payyannur to stop the prosecution in C.C.No.508/2010 and

acquit the petitioners or to direct the court of Judicial First

Class Magistrate-Payyannur to dispose of the case within a

time frame."

     2.  Heard the counsel for the petitioners and the

Crl.M.C.No.3794 of 2013
                              2

learned Public Prosecutor.

      3.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances of

the case it appears that the de facto complainant who is the

2nd respondent herein was married by the 1st petitioner and

according to her, after the marriage, she was subjected to

harassment both mentally and physically, insisting to bring

more dowry and thus the accused has committed the

offence punishable under section 498 A of IPC. On

completing the investigation, the police preferred report

based upon which, the court took cognizance              and

instituted C.C.No.508/10 in the court below.            Even

according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, on

7.5.2012, there was a posting of the above case for

producing CWs.1 and 2, since NBW has already been issued

against them. It is the further submission of the learned

counsel that on 7.5.2012, CWs.1 and 2 did not appear, but

the learned counsel for the petitioners is totally ignorant of

the further steps ordered by the learned Magistrate on the

failure of appearance of CWs.1 and 2 before that court on

Crl.M.C.No.3794 of 2013
                                3

7.5.2012. So, it cannot be said that the learned Magistrate

is protracting the proceedings or there is laches in

completing the trial. From the submission of the learned

counsel for the petitioner it is clear that the court is taking

every earnest steps towards the progress of the trial. I am

of the opinion that, if the witnesses are not responding

properly and failed to attend the proceedings, the court will

take appropriate coercive steps to secure the presence of

the petitioners and thereby to expedite the trial of the case.

Hence, I find no fault with the proceedings adopted by the

learned Magistrate and therefore, there is no merit in this

petition.

      Subject      to  the above    observation,  this  M.C.is

dismissed.

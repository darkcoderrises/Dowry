                  Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 15th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused in Crime No.825 of 2013 of

Pathanamthitta Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 323, 324, 326, 427 & 447 of I.P.C with a

prayer   to   quash    Annexure-I    FIR    registered  by   the

Pathanamthitta Police station against the petitioner and the

entire proceedings based on Crime No.825 of 2013 registered

by the Pathanamthitta Police Station as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that on

23.05.2013 at about 6 pm the accused trespassed into the

courtyard of the house of the first respondent and beat him on

the left side of his neck and he attempted to attack the de

facto complainant with a chopper and first respondent

prevented the attack with his left hand which resulted in the

cut injury and fracture on the left hand of the de facto

complainant.      It is also alleged that the petitioner has

caused cut injuries on the right leg of first respondent and

Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013          2

further alleged that the petitioner damaged the mobile phone

of the first respondent and caused a loss of Rs.4,000/- and

thus the petitioner/accused has committed the offences

punishable under Sections 323, 324, 326, 427 and 447 of IPC

and now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

out of court.

           3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

           4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.             Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

           5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

           6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013          3

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. Annexure-2

is the affidavit of the first respondent. They have also filed a

compromise deed which is signed by both petitioner as well as

the de facto complainant and counter signed by the respective

counsels. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also

no objection in allowing the above petition.

           7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 323, 324, 326, 427

and 447 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved.     It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

first respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/s accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013             4

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                   "57. The position that emerges from
           the above discussion can be summarised
           thus:      the power of the High Court in
           quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
           complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
           power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of
           the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the
           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
           abuse of the process of any Court. In what
           cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim
           have settled their dispute would depend on
           the facts and circumstances of each case
           and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

            "......... But the criminal cases having
            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
            flavour stand on different footing for the
            purposes     of quashing,   particularly   the
            offences arising from commercial, financial,
            mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
            transactions or the offences arising out of
            matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
            family disputes where the wrong is basically
            private or personal in nature and the
            parties have resolved their entire dispute.

Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013            5

            In this category of cases, High Court may
            quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
            because of the compromise between the
            offender and victim, the possibility of
            conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
            continuation of criminal case would put
            accused to great oppression and prejudice
            and extreme injustice would be caused to
            him by not quashing the criminal case
            despite    full and complete settlement and
            compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2811 of 2013          6

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -I FIR in Crime No.825 of 2013 of Pathanamthitta

Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

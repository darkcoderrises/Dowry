                 ---------------------------
                Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014
              -------------------------------
        Dated this the 4th day of June, 2014

                          ORDER


        This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1

to 10 in C.C.No.403/2013 pending before the Judicial

First class Magistrate's Court - I, Thamarassery to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement under

Section 482 of the code o Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called as the 'Code')

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 10 in Crime No.238/2013

of Thamarassery Police station which was registered on

the basis of      the statement given by the second

respondent      as   de    facto   complainant     alleging

commission of offence under Sections 143, 147, 148,

341, 323, 324 and Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code. Apart from the de facto complainant respondents

3 and 4 who were shown as CWs 2 and 3 also

sustained injuries.

     3. It was a clash between the sympathizers of

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014        2

S.S.F.party and Indian Union Muslim League. Both

belong to same community. After investigation final

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C. No.

403/2013 and it is now pending before the Judicial

First   Class     Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery.

Between the same faction, some other incidents also

happened and C.C.No.402/2013 and 578/2013 were

also pending before the same court      in respect of

those incidents happened between the same two

groups. Since it happened between the two factions of

the same community on account of their political

ideology due to the intervention of well wishers and

community leaders,        the matter has been settled

between the parties and they have decided to

withdraw all the criminal cases in connection with this

factional difference. Since some of the offences are

non compoundable in nature, they could not file an

application before the concerned magistrate court on

account of the settlement no purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case as well. So they have no

other remedy except to approach this Court seeking

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014          3

the following relief:

             to quash the proceedings as against

        the petitioners/accused 1 to 10 pursuant to

        Annexure     A    final report  in   Crime

        No.238/2013 registered by Thamarassery

        police station now pending before the

        Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

        Thamarassery as C.C.No.403/2013 in the

        interest of justice.



      4. Respondents 2 to 4 appeared through counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of

community leaders and on account of the settlement

they do not want to prosecute the case and they filed

Annexures H, I, and J affidavits respectively stating

these facts.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted

that in view of the settlement, there is no possibility

of any conviction and so he prayed for allowing the

application.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions

as directed by this Court, submitted that except these

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014       4

cases there is no other case between these parties and

it was a clash between two groups of same community

and in such cases the power under Section 482 of the

Code need not be invoked to quash the proceedings.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement      given     by the   second    respondent,

Thamarassery        police has  registered  Crime   No.

238/2013 of that police station against the petitioners

alleging offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,

148, 341, 323, 324 and Section 149 of the Indian

Penal Code.

      8. After investigation,  Annexure A final report

was filed and the case was taken on file as

C.C.No.403/2013 and now pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Thamarassery. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. It is an

admitted fact that both these accused as well as the

de fcto complainant and respondents 3 and 4 belongs

to same community namely muslim community.          Due

to some political ideological difference,    there was

some split in the community and        they showed the

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014       5

allegiance to the Indian Muslim League party and SSF

party respectively and then difference of opinion arose

and clashes occurred and some other cases have been

registered in respect of these incidents. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of mediators and well wishers and the

party leaders and community leaders so as to bring

harmony among the members of the community. It is

true that the people are now forgetting the fact the

religion is intended for the welfare of the people and

they should not be over govern by the religion. They

are only expected to follow the preachings of the

religion to lead a perfect life. But that principle is

being violated and this is being misused for their

personal purposes which resulted in clashes like this

causing      difference of opinion among the same

community as well. It       is true that such fanatic

vandalism in the name of religion should not be

encouraged as submitted by the learned Public

Prosecutor. But considering the fact that settlement

has been arrived at due to the intervention of all the

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014              6

persons concerned in the same community to bring

harmony among the members of the community and

on account of the settlement there is no possibility of

any conviction as well as none of the prosecution

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution and

conviction of such cases will be remote. There is no

purpose in proceeding with the case as it will amount

to wastage of judicial time alone.

      9. Further the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the

      above discussion can be summarised thus: the

      power of the High Court in quashing in criminal

      proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of

      its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

      from the power given to a criminal court for

      compounding the offences under S.320 of the

      Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

      no statutory limitation but it has to be

      exercised    in  accord     with   the   guideline

      engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

      process of any Court. In what cases power to

      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or

      F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014            7

      victim have settled their dispute would depend

      on the facts and circumstances of each case

      and no category can be prescribed. However,

      before exercise of such power, the High Court

      must have due regard to the nature and

      gravity of the crime.     Heinous and serious

      offences of mental depravity or offences like

      murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

      quashed even though the victim or victim's

      family and the offender have settled the

      dispute.    Such offences are not private in

      nature and have serious impact on society.

      Similarly, any compromise between the victim

      and offender in relation to the offences under

      special statutes like Prevention of Corruption

      Act or the offences committed by public

      servants while working in that capacity etc;

      cannot provide for any basis for quashing

      criminal proceedings involving such offences.

      But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly

      and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on

      different footing for the purposes of quashing,

      particularly   the    offences   arising   from

      commercial,     financial,   mercantile,   civil,

      partnership or such like transactions or the

      offences arising out of matrimony relating to

      dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the

      wrong is basically private or personal in nature

      and the parties have resolved their entire

      dispute. In this category of case, High Court

      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

      because of the compromise between the

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014            8

      offender    and   victim,  the    possibility of

      conviction    is   remote   and     bleak    and

      continuation of criminal case would put accused

      to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

      injustice would be caused to him by not

      quashing the criminal case despite full and

      complete settlement and compromise with the

      victim. In other words, the High Court must

      consider whether it would be unfair or contrary

      to the interest of justice to continue with the

      criminal proceeding or continuation of the

      criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse

      of process of law despite settlement and

      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer

      and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and

      if the answer to the above question(s) is in

      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within

      its   jurisdiction  to   quash    the    criminal

      proceeding."

      10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a clash

between the same community people and on account

of the settlement harmony has been brought in among

the community people hoping that this will lead a

better future and avoid unnecessary tension in the

locality and in view of the settlement conviction will be

Crl.M.C.No.2766 of 2014         9

remote. This court feels that the power under Section

482 of the Code         can be invoked to quash the

proceedings in order to promote the settlement which

this Court hope and believe,       has brought harmony

among the people belong to the same community and

further clashes in the locality will be avoided on

account of this settlement and they will try to live on

the belief that religion is for their benefit and it should

not be used as a weapon to promote fanaticism and

bring hatredness among the same community people

or others as well.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.403/2013 (Crime No.238/2013 of Thamarassery

Police Station pending before the Judicial First class

Magistrate's Court - I, Thamarassery as against the

petitioners is hereby quashed.

         Office is directed to communicate this order to

the concerned court immediately for necessary action.

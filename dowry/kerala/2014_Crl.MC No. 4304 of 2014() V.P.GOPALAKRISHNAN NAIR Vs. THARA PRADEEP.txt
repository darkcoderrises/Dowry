                           V.K.MOHANAN, J
                  ===========================
                        Crl.M.C No.4304 of 2014
                 ============================
                 Dated this the 4th day of August, 2014

                                 ORDER


                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused numbers 1 to 4 in C.C.No.379/2005 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Changanassery, for the offences

punishable under Sections 420, 406, 120(B), 354, 366(B), 506 and 34 of

the I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I to III as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that the accused 1 to 4 are

alleged to have conspired among themselves with the intention to cheat the

de facto complainant for making unlawful financial gain to themselves and

thereby cause unlawful loss to her and also promising good job at Saudi

Arabia in the company where the first accused was working for the de

facto complainant and her husband for salaries at the rate of `9,000/- per

month each received a sum of `5 lakhs from the de facto complainant and

Crl.M.C No.4304/2014                   2



after taking them to Saudi Arabia, the accused did not arrange to provide

them the deserving jobs and on 19th May, 2001 the accused caught hold of

the de facto complainant at her residence to outrage her modesty and after

reaching home from Saudi the 4th accused called her over phone and

abused and thereby all the accused committed the aforesaid offences and

now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the 1st

respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

          6.    I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

Crl.M.C No.4304/2014                        3



respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only under

Sections 420, 406, 120(B), 354, 366(B), 506 and 34 of the I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.              It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From

the submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing
          a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given

Crl.M.C No.4304/2014                        4



           to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of
           the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
           to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power
           to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full    and   complete   settlement and   compromise     with   the
           victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

Crl.M.C No.4304/2014                    5



proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C.

can be allowed granting the relief as sought for. It is also relevant to note that

the petitioners and the first respondent approached this Court with the above

prayer in terms of the settlement arrived in the Kerala mediation Centre

connected with R.F.A No.69/2010 of this Court. So, according to me, it is the

duty of this Court to encourage such settlement and thereby to allow the

Crl.M.C in terms of the prayer.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I to III and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No. 379/2005 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Changanassery.

                    Crl.M.C.No. 231 of 2013 - D
                  ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 4th day of July, 2013

                               O R D E R

                 The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1,4 and 5 in C.C.No.112 of 2003

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,Kozhikode,          which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 42 of 1999 of

Panniyankara Police Station, Kozhikode District for the offences

punishable under Sections 143,147,148,452,324,506(II) read with

Section 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A final report

in Crime No.42 of 1999 of Panniyankara Police Station and all further

proceedings pursuant to that against the petitioners, which is now

pending as C.C.No.112 of 2003 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kozhikode as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.  The allegation in the above case is that on 24.5.1999 at

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                  :-2-:

2 a.m., all the accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly

with deadly weapons and entered into the house of the de facto

complainant and when the said act was questioned, they caused hurt to

the de facto complainant and intimidated his family members and

thereby, the accused have committed the above offences. Now, the

case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court between

the petitioners and respondents 2 to 4.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

respondents 2 to 4. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.    The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4, who on the

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

basis of specific instruction received from the respondents submitted

that the above respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the

charge witnesses 2 and 3 do not intend to proceed any further against

the petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. Annexure C is the affidavit sworn by the second

respondent and Annexure D by the third respondent. I have verified

the documents and materials produced along with the above petition.

In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 143,147,148,452,324,506(II) read with Section 149 of

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                       :-4-:

I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved.      It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for respondents 2 to 4, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused

in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108] (SC)] which is

squarely applicable in the present case. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                             :-5-:

          Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                         :-6-:

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in

the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in

the present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled

the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of the trial proceeded, there would not have

any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings.                   Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.231 of 2013

                                 :-7-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure A

final report in Crime No.42 of 1999 of Panniyankara Police Station

and all further proceedings pursuant to that against the petitioners,

which is now pending as C.C.No.112 of 2003 on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kozhikode.

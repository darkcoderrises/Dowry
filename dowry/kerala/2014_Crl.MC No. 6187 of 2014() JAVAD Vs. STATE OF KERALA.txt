                  ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 4th day of November, 2014.

                             O R D E R



     The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime

No.609/2014     of    Thamarassery      Police    Station alleging

commission of offence punishable under Secs.451, 341 & 354

IPC.   Annexure-A is the impugned FIR in in the impugned

Crime No.609/2014 of Thamarassery Police Station.             The

prosecution allegation is that the accused on 15.8.2014 at

4:00 p.m. had trespassed into the house of the 2nd respondent

(defacto complainant) and attempted to outrage the modesty

of the 2nd respondent while she was doing work in the kitchen.

Thereafter, the 2nd respondent filed complaint before the

Thamarassery Police Station against the petitioner and on the

basis of the first information statement of the 2nd respondent,

police registered the above said crime No.609/2014 against

the petitioner for the above said offences. It is stated that

now the disputes between the parties have been amicably

settled and that the 2nd respondent is not interested to

continue the criminal proceedings. The 2nd respondent-defacto

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

complainant has filed affidavit dated 18.10.2014 produced as

Annexure-B in this Crl.M.C stating the above aspects and

further stating that the matter has been amicably settled

between the parties and the impugned criminal proceedings

may be quashed.        It is in the light of the facts and

circumstances, the instant Crl.M.C has been filed with the

prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-A FIR in Crime

No.609/2014 of Thamarassery Police Station and all further

proceedings arising therefrom on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Thamarassery in the interest of

justice.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.Jose

Kuriakose, Advocate, has taken notice for the 2nd respondent

and the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.Luiz Godwin D'Couth, learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner, Sri.Jose Kuriakose, learned

counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent and the learned

Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between

the parties, and that the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case/crime will cause miscarriage of justice to both

parties as the real disputants to the controversy have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money     and    would   unnecessarily    strain  the   judicial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.Jose Kuriakose, learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the

petitioner and that he has no objection in the quashment of

the    impugned     criminal    proceedings    and    that   the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner as he has no grievance against

him and that they will not raise any dispute/complaint in future

if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is allowed.

                               ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for the 2nd

respondent,    it   is  clear     to    the   Court    that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.

      8.   In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

                                     ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

                                   ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

            "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
      are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect
      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

                               ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.6187 Of 2014

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-A FIR in Crime No.609/2014 of Thamarassery Police

Station which is now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Thamarassery and all further proceedings

arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioner shall produce

certified copies of this order before the Station House Officer

concerned as well as before the jurisdictional Magistrate

concerned.

                                         ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                   Judge.

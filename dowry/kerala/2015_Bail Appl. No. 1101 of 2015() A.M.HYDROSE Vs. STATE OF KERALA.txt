                  ================
                     B.A. No. 1101 of 2015
            =======================
            Dated this the 5th day of March, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2. Petitioners are A2 to A4 in Crime No.66/15 of the New

Mahi Police Station, Kannur District, registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 406, 506 and 498A read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her

with cruelty, by demanding more dowry and gold ornaments, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   The main overt acts are alleged against the 1st accused,

who is the husband of the de facto complainant. No criminal

B.A. No. 1101 of 2015
                                    2

antecedents have been reported against the petitioners. Being a

matrimonial offence, this Court has to consider the possibility of

the settlement and re-union in the matter. Considering the same,

and considering the allegations against the petitioners, I am of the

view that this is not a case wherein the custodial interrogation of

the petitioners is required for the continued investigation of this

case. Matters being so, anticipatory bail can be granted to the

petitioners.

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge the petitioners on

bail in the event of their arrest on each of them executing a bond

for 25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent

sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and        subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

B.A. No. 1101 of 2015
                                    3

            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

      all Thursdays and Mondays, commencing                  from

      12.03.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with the

      evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

      available for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

     It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

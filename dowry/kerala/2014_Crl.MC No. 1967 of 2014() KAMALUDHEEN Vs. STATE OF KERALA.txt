                   Crl.M.C. No. 1967 of 2014-A
                ---------------------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 7th April, 2014

                           O R D E R

      This Criminal Miscellaneous Case               is    filed by the

petitioners, who are the        1st and 2nd accused           in C.C No.

896/2013 (Crime No.892/2013           of Kilikollur     police     station)

pending before     the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kollam for quashing the proceedings in view of the settlement

under Section 482 of the            Code of        Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter referred to as 'the Code').

      2. It is alleged in the petition that there             was some

dispute regarding the disposal of waste in the cashew

packing centre owned by 1st petitioner and managed by

2nd petitioner and on account of                that enmity,         some

altercation occurred which resulted in the registration of

the crime. It is also alleged in the petition that the petitioners

are 1st and 2nd accused in C.C.No. 896/2013 on the file of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I Kollam. The case was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the defacto

Crl.M.C. No. 1967 of 2014-A
                                2

complainant/2nd respondent      against the petitioners alleging

offences under Sections 294(b) and 506(i) read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.   After investigation final report was

filed and it was taken on file as CC.No.896/2013 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I Kollam.

      3. Now the matter has been settled between the parties.

Due to    the settlement, the relationship   between them    has

been restored. On       account of the settlement, the defacto

complainant does not want to prosecute the case any further.

Since some of the offences are non- compoundable in nature,

they could not file application for compounding before the

court below. No purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case. So they have no other remedy       except to approach this

Court seeking the following relief:

          "For the above reasons and other valid grounds

          that are to be urged at the time of hearing it is

          most humbly prayed in the interest of justice that

          this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash

          Annexure A1      and A2 FIR and Final Report in

          Crime No.892/2013 of Kilikollur Police Station in

          Kollam District pending as C.C. No.986/2013 on

          the file of the Judicial first Class Magistrate

Crl.M.C. No. 1967 of 2014-A
                                   3

           Court- I, Kollam by accepting Annexure A3

           affidavit of the 2nd respondent".

      4. The counsel for the 2nd respondent appeared through

counsel     and    submitted that    the matter has been settled

between the parties due to intervention of mediators and their

relationship has been restored. She does not want to prosecute

the case any further.        She filed Annexure - A3 affidavit

stating these facts.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the case. So, she prayed for allowing the application.

      6. The learned       Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners and there is no criminal antecedents

but opposed the application.

      7. It is an admitted fact that the petitioners are the 1st and

2nd accused in C.C.No.896/2013 which was originated on the

basis of the statement given by the defacto complainant/2nd

respondent against the petitioners as Crime No. 892/2013 of

Kilikollur Police Station alleging offences under Sections 294

(b) and 506(i) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

Crl.M.C. No. 1967 of 2014-A
                                      4

After investigation final report was filed and it is now pending

as C.C No. 896/2013.

      8. Now the matter has been settled between the parties.

It is seen from the affidavit and allegations in the petition that

the parties are friends and the incident occurred due to

misunderstanding between them which resulted in registration

of the crime and filing of the final report. The matter has been

settled between the parties due to intervention of mediators.

On account of the settlement            original relationship between

them has been restored and the defacto complainant                   does

not want to prosecute the case.           Further, on account of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction also, even if

the case is allowed to proceed with. The case is not a case of

public interest affecting public safety or affecting the society

at large. It is a private dispute which resulted in registration

of the crime and filing of the final report.

      9. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

Crl.M.C. No. 1967 of 2014-A
                                       5

          the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

          arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

          partnership or such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

          family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

          of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

          continuation of criminal case would put accused to

          great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

          would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

          case   despite    full and   complete    settlement  and

          compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

          Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

          contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

          criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

          proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

          law despite settlement and compromise between the

          victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

          of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

          an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

          affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

          jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

                                 6



      10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and no public interest is involved     as it is

not a case of offence affecting the society at large and in view

of the settlement, the original relationship has been restored

between the parties        and no purpose   will be    served by

proceeding with the case as conviction will be remote and        it

will be wastage of judicial time, this Court feels that it is a fit

case where power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings       in order to promote the

settlement and restoration of relationship between the parties

and the pendency of this case will not be a hurdle for the same.

      So, the petition is   allowed  and further proceedings in

C.C.No 896/2013 (Crime No. Kilikollur police station) pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I Kollamt as

against the petitioners is quashed.

concerned court immediately.

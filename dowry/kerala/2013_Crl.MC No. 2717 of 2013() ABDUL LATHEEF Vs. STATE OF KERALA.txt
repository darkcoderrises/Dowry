                Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 4th day of July, 2013.


                         O R D E R

          The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is accused in C.C.No.381/07

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Mannarkkad,

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No. 381/07 of Mannarkkad Police Station] for the offences

punishable under Section 498 A of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash the conviction and sentence entered against the

petitioner by Annexure -3 judgment dated 17.9.2011 in

C.C.No.381/07 and Crl.A.No.491/11 pending on the file of

Additional Session's Judge (Fast Track Court No.II),

Palakkad, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.    The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner herein married the de facto complainant who is

                               2
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


the 2nd respondent on 29.3.1998 and after that they were

residing in the matrimonial house at Arappara and

according          to   the  prosecution,      the    accused

misappropriated the entire money and gold given to PW1

and it is also the allegation that the petitioner harassed the

de facto complainant on demanding more money and gold

and     thereby      the accused   committed    the   offences

punishable under section 498 A of IPC.

         3.     The police on completing the investigation in

Crime No.172/07 which was registered on the basis of the

petition preferred by the de facto complainant before the

Sub Inspector of Mannarkkad police station, upon which

the court took cognizance and instituted C.C.No.381/07

and by judgment dated 17.9.2011 the court of Judicial First

Class      Magistrate,     Mannarkkad     found    that    the

petitioner/accused      is guilty  and   accordingly   he   is

sentenced. Challenging the above order and sentence, the

petitioner herein preferred an appeal, ie., Crl.A.No.491/11

before the Additional Session's Judge (Fast Track Court

                              3
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


No.II), Palakkad. Now, the case of the petitioner/s is that

the matter is settled out of court.     Annexure 4 is the

affidavit sworn in by the de facto complainant/the 2nd

respondent.

         4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/s

as well as the 2nd respondent.      I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, matrimonial as

well as the criminal disputes, which are the subject

matters of the above case, are settled amicably and now

they are now residing together as man and wife,.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received      from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

                              4
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


against him.

         6.       I have carefully considered   the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 498 A of

I.P.C., which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved.   It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.      From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

                                   5
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.     In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the

Honourable Apex Court,             in the decision reported in

Jitendra       Raghuvanshi         and     Others     v.  Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has

held as follows:-

                "7.    It is not in dispute that matrimonial
         disputes have been on considerable increase in
         recent times resulting in filing of complaints
         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only
         against the husband but also against the
         relatives of the husband. The question is when
         such matters are resolved either by the wife
         agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by
         mutual settlement of other pending disputes for
         which both the sides approached the High Court
         and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal
         proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife
         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether
         the prayer can be declined on the sole ground
         that since the offences are non-compoundable
         under Section 320 of the Code, it would be
         impermissible for the court to quash the criminal
         proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on
         hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal
         complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC
         and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition
         Act, 1961, with the help and intervention of
         family members, friends and well-wishers, the
         parties concerned have amicably settled their
         differences           and         executed       a
         compromise/settlement.        Pursuant thereto, the
         appellants filed the said compromise before the

                                  6
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


         Trial Court with a request to place the same on
         record and to drop the criminal proceedings
         against the appellants herein. It is also not in
         dispute      that  in  additional   to  the   mutual
         settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-
         wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she
         did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings
         against the appellants and fully supported the
         contents of the settlement deed.            It is the
         grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial
         Court rejected such prayer of the parties but also
         the High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction
         under Section 482 of the Code only on the
         ground that the criminal proceedings relate to
         the offences punishable under Sections 498A and
         406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in
         nature."
                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts
         to         encourage    genuine     settlements    of
         matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the
         same are on considerable increase. Even if the
         offences are non-compoundable, if they relate to
         matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied
         that the parties have settled the same amicably
         and without any pressure, we hold that for the
         purpose of securing ends of justice, Section 320
         of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of
         power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
         subsequent criminal proceedings.
                    13.   There has been an outburst of
         matrimonial disputes in recent times.            The
         institution of marriage occupies an important
         place and it has an important role to play in the
         society. Therefore, every effort should be made
         in the interest of the individuals in order to
         enable them to settle down in life and live
         peacefully.      If the parties ponder over their
         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably
         by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in
         a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in
         the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be

                                 7
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


         less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary
         jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power
         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly
         and with circumspection only when the Court is
         convinced, on the basis of material on record,
         that allowing the proceedings to continue would
         be an abuse of the process of the Court or that
         the ends of justice require that the proceedings
         ought to be quashed."

In the present case, the only offence involved is under

Section 498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the

said offence originated from the matrimonial issues, which

are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus

to the criminal case as well. According to me, in the light

of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be

squarely applicable in the present case. According to me,

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.

It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court,     in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

                               8
Crl.M.C.No.2717 of 2013


would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be

sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing the

conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner vide

Annexure 3 judgment in C.C.No.381/07 of the court of

Judicial First Class Magistrate-Mannarkkad, and all further

proceedings in Crl.A.No.491/11 on the file of the court of

Additional Session's Judge (Fast Track Court No.II),

Palakkad.

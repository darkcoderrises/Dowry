                       ===============================
                       Bail Application No.4895 of 2010
                       ===============================
                            DATED: 30.09.2010

                                  O R D E R

       Petitioner who are accused Nos.2 to 5 in Crime No.448/2010 of

Kumbla Police Station for an offence punishable under Section.498A I.P.C.

and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, seeks anticipatory bail.

       2.    The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application.

       3.     Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of this nature.

But at the same time, I am inclined to permit the petitioners to surrender

before the Investigating Officer for the purpose of interrogation and then to

have their application for bail considered by the Magistrate          having

jurisdiction.   Accordingly, the petitioners shall surrender before the

investigating officer on 15.09.2010 or on      16.09.10 for the purpose of

interrogation and      recovery of incriminating material,     if any.  The

petitioners shall thereafter be produced before the Magistrate who on being

satisfied that the petitioners have been interrogated by the Police, shall

consider and dispose of their application for regular bail preferably on the

same date on which it is filed.

       This petition is disposed of as above.



                                                     V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE

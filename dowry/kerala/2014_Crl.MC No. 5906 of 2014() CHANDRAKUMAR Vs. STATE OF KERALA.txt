                   ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
            =========================
                   Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014
         ============================
         Dated this the 05th day of November, 2014

                            ORDER



      The petitioners are arrayed as accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime

No.787 of 2010 of Panangad Police Station for offences alleged

under Sections 279, 294(b), 323, 324, 427 and 34 of Indian Penal

Code. Annexure 1 is the copy of the FIR in the impugned Crime

No.787 of 2010.     The police after investigation submitted the

impugned Annexure 2 final report/charge sheet in the impugned

Annexure 1 Crime No.787 of 2010 of Panangad Police Station.

Pursuant to the filing of the impugned Annexure 1 final

report/charge sheet the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Ernakulam has taken cognizance and this has led to the

institution of the Calendar Case C.C No.22 of 2011 on the file of

the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam and the

petitioners have been enlarged on bail.

      2.   The gist of the prosecution allegation is that the

petitioners who were riding and travelling in a motor cycle

recklessly met with an accident with the de facto complainant's

car and because of the sudden enmity caused due to the accident

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014         2



the petitioners attacked the de facto complainant and his

daughter with their hands causing injury to the de facto

complainant and his daughter and that they caused damage to

the de facto complainant's car. It is stated that now the entire

disputes have been settled between the petitioners and the

contesting respondents 2 and 3. It is further stated that the

contesting respondents 2 and 3 have separately filed affidavits

dated 07.08.2014 produced as Annexures 3 and 4 in this Crl.M.C

stating that the matters are settled between the parties and that

they are now in good terms and that they have no grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the impugned crime and that

the allegations in the present case arise out of purely private and

personal disputes between the petitioners and respondents 2 and

3 and that the injuries sustained by them are minor in nature and

that respectable persons in the locality   mediated    the   entire

issues and settled the matter and that they have no complaint

against the petitioner and that they have no objection in

quashing the impugned FIR, final report and all further

proceedings in the above said crime, which was instituted at

their instance. It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances that the petitioners have filed the aforementioned

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014          3



Crl.M.C with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure 2 final

report/charge sheet filed in the impugned Annexure 1 FIR in

Crime No.787 of 2010 of Panangad Police Station, Ernakulam,

which has led to the institution of the Calendar Case C.C No.22

of 2011 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Ernakulam and all further proceedings arising therefrom.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.Ajith George

has taken notice for the 2nd and 3rd respondents and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State of

Kerala.

      4.    Heard Sri.P.J.Mathew, the learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners, Sri.Ajith George, learned counsel appearing

for 2nd and 3rd respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor

appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Kerala.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned impugned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of

the aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014          4



arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time

and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.Ajith George, the learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd and 3rd respondents, has submitted on the basis of the

specific instructions furnished by the 2nd and 3rd respondents that

they have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and

that they have no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as

they have no grievance against them and that they will not raise

any dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this

court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law

well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014              5



that the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and

not much element of public interest is involved.               The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved,

the real disputants to the controversy which has led to the

impugned criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter. From the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it is clear
                                       a



to the court that the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of

the settlement arrived at by them. In this connection, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Apex Court in the case

between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1)

SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108

(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [See SCC (Cri)]:

                "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
         with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court.      In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
         or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend on the

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014                  6



          facts and circumstances of each case and no category
          can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
           and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
           footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
           offences          arising       from        commercial,
           financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
           relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
           wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
           the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of
           conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
           criminal case would put accused to great oppression
           and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
           to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
           and complete settlement and compromise with the
           victim........"

       In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8) Scale 634

= III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC), the Apex Court

has held as follows:

              "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
       entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
       peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
       proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace
       and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash
       them".

       The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014          7



         9. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have

arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably between

the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the

light of the facts and circumstances involved in the present case

and particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions

of the Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned

criminal proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there may not be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of

conviction of the accused is rather negligible and therefore, the

net result of continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer

waste of judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would

amount to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the

larger sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited

Crl.M.C No.5906 of 2014            8



supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be

allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. In the interest of

justice    it is ordered that the impugned Annexure 2 final

report/charge sheet filed in the impugned Annexure 1 FIR in

Crime No.787 of 2010 of Panangad Police Station, Ernakulam,

which has led to the institution of C.C No.22 of 2011 on the file

of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam and

all further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed.       The

petitioners shall produce certified copies of this order before the

court below concerned as well as before the Station House

Officer, Panangad Police Station, Ernakulam.

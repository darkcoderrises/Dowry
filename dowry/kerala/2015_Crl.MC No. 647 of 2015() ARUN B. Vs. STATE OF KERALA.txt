                   ================
                    Crl.M.C. No. 647 of 2015
             =======================
            Dated this the 11th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R



      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1082 of 2012 of the

Ernakulam Town North Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in Crime

No.1082/2012 of Ernakulam Town North Police Station and all

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.153 of 2015 pending before

the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Ernakulam,

quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

Crl.M.C. No. 647 of 2015
                                 2

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd    respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed. She has entered appearance

through her counsel.       The learned counsel for the defacto

complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been

sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in

Crl.M.C. No. 647 of 2015
                                3

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.1082/2012 of Ernakulam Town North

Police Station and all    further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.153 of 2015 pending before the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate's Court, Ernakulam, are hereby quashed.




                                              Sd/-
                                  B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

          ................................................................
                          B.A. No.3 of 2015
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 15th day of January, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners           are        the       accused           in Crime

No.1248/2014 of the Hosdurg Police Station, Kasaragod

registered for the offence punishable under Section 498A of

the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the first petitioner and treated her with cruelty, by

demanding       more       dowry         and      gold       ornaments,     after

misappropriating her entire 75 sovereigns of gold ornaments

and an amount of 3 lakhs. She was harassed and tortured

to the maximum by demanding her to sell and handover the

B.A.No. 3 of 2015
                                -: 2 :-



sale proceeds of 50 cents of property belongs to her. The

second petitioner is the mother of the first petitioner and

petitioners 3 and 4 are the sisters of the first petitioner.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the CD.

      5.     The contents of the CD, prima facie, reveal the

complicity of the first petitioner. It has been reported that the

first petitioner has married again, during the subsistence of

his marriage with the defacto complainant, on 20.11.2014.

The cruelty meted out by the defacto complainant from the

first petitioner is writ large from the contents of the CD.

Therefore, this is not a fit case wherein the discretionary

relief of anticipatory bail can be granted to the first petitioner.

      6.     At the same time, the custodial interrogation of

petitioners 2 to 4 is not required for the continued

investigation of this case. Considering the allegations

against petitioners 2 to 4 and their lesser involvement in

torturing and harassing the defacto complainant, this Court

B.A.No. 3 of 2015
                                 -: 3 :-



is of the view that anticipatory bail can be granted to them.

      7.     In the result, this bail application is allowed in part

and the investigating officer or such other police officer, who

is conducting the arrest of petitioners 2 to 4, is directed to

enlarge petitioners 2 to 4 on bail in the event of their arrest

on each of them executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees

twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for

the like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting

arrest, and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

              (i)   Petitioners 2 to 4 shall report before

       the investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

       a.m. on all Thursdays and Mondays commencing

       from 22.01.2015 for a period of three months or

       till the filing of the final report in this case,

       whichever is earlier.

              (ii)  Petitioners 2 to 4 shall not tamper with

       the evidence or influence witnesses.

              (iii) Petitioners   2     to  4   shall    make

       themselves available for interrogation as and

       when required by the investigating officer.

              (iv) Petitioners 2 to 4 shall not involve in

B.A.No. 3 of 2015
                                -: 4 :-



       any offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

      This petition, as far as the 1st petitioner is concerned, is

dismissed.

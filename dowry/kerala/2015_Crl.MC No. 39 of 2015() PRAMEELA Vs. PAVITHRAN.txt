           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   Petitioner is the defacto complainant                         in Crime

No.260/2011 of Chombala Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Sections 403, 406, 420 and 498A of

the Indian Penal Code.

      3.   Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-3 FIR and Annexure-4

final report in Crime No.260/2011 of Chombala Police Station as

against the 1st respondent, who is the husband of the petitioner,

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.684/2011

pending before the Judicial first Class Magistrate's Court,

Vatakara, quashed.

      4.   The allegation against the 1st respondent is that he

had tortured and harassed the petitioner, who is his wife, and

Crl.M.C. No. 39 of 2015
                                 2

treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC,

by demanding more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the 1st respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between her and and her husband, who is the 1st respondent

herein, have been amicably settled and presently, she has no

complaints against the 1st respondent and, therefore, the

proceedings against the 1st respondent may be quashed.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the petitioner has no complaints

against the 1st respondent, it is only just and expedient in the

interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-3 FIR

and Annexure-4 final report in Crime No.260/2011 of Chombala

Police Station as against the 1st respondent and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.684/2011 pending before the

               -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 27th day of June, 2013

                          O R D E R

     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.      Petitioners are the second to fifth

accused in Crime No.140/2013 of Chandera Police Station

registered for the offences punishable under Sections 323,

324 and 498 A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant,

who is the wife of the first accused, and treated her with

cruelty, by demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The

contents of the CD reveal that no specific overt acts are

alleged against any of the petitioners. All the main overt

acts are alleged against the first accused. Petitioners are

the aged parents and other relatives of the first accused.

Considering the facts and circumstances of this case and

the present stage of investigation, I do not think that the

B.A. No. 2174 of 2013
                                 2

custodial interrogation of the petitioners is required for

the continued investigation of this case. Matters being

so, anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

       In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest

on each of them executing a bond for ` 25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties for

the like sum each to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and       subject to the following terms

and conditions.

           (1) The petitioners shall report before the

     Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

     on all Thursdays and Mondays, commencing from

     04.07.2013 for a period of three months or till the

     filing of the final report in this case, which ever is

     earlier.

           (2) The petitioners shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (3) The petitioners shall make themselves

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the Investigating Officer.

B.A. No. 2174 of 2013
                                 3

           (4) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

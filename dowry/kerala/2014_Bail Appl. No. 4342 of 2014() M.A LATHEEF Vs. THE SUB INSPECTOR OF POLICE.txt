                      B.A. No. 4342 of 2014

              ----------------------------------------------

            Dated this the 18th day of June, 2014


                                ORDER

     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.96/2014 of

Manjeshwar Police Station which has been registered for the

offences under Sections 323, 498(A) and 506(ii) read with

Section 34 I.P.C.

     2.  The first petitioner is the husband of the de facto-

complainant and the other petitioners are his parents. They are

alleged to have subjected the de facto-complainant to cruelty

demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     4.   The marriage between the first petitioner and the

de facto-complainant took place on 16.07.2006. They have no

children. Since this is a family matter, the first attempt of the

court should be to bring back harmony to the family. There is no

allegation that the petitioners inflicted any serious injury to the

B.A. No. 4342 /2014                 2


de facto-complainant. If they happen to be detained, the chances

of reconciliation may become impossible. So I think it is proper

to grant the prayer of the petitioners.

       In the result, this application is allowed.

         1.      The petitioners shall be released on bail on

                 their executing a bond for Rs. 25,000/- with

                 two solvent sureties each for the like sum if

                 they are arrested by the Police in connection

                 with this case.

         2.      They shall appear before the Investigating

                 Officer for interrogation if they are so

                 required by him in writing.

         3.      They shall not destroy or tamper with

                 evidence.

       This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose to

surrender before the Magistrate concerned and in such case the

learned Magistrate may take appropriate action in accordance

with the law.

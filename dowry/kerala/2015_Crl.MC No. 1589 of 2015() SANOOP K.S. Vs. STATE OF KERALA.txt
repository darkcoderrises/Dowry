         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                  Dated this the 24th day of March 2015

                                      ORDER


      Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482    Cr.P.C.      for     getting       Annexure-A1            final     report in

C.C.No.1013/13 of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Payyannur and all further proceedings based on it, quashed.

      3.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife of

the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant/ 3rd respondent herein, and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.1589/2015                 2

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably settled

and, therefore, she has no complaints against the petitioners, and,

hence, all further proceedings in the matter referred to above can

be quashed. She has entered appearance through her counsel. The

learned counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on

her own volition.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

Crl.M.C.1589/2015                  3

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1 final

report, and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1013/13

of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Payyannur, are hereby

quashed.

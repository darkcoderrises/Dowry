                 ---------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014
               -------------------------------
        Dated this the 30th day of May, 2014

                          ORDER


       This is an application filed by the accused

persons in Crime No.2953/2013 of Kottarakara Police

Station for quashing the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called as the 'Code')

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused persons in Crime No.2953/2013 of

Kottarakara Police Station on the basis of the statement

given by the third respondent alleging commission of

offences under Section 294(b), 323, 324 and 308 read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3. The incident happened on account of some

dispute regarding the playing of songs in the bus and

the de facto complainant and the petitioners were

employees working in the same bus. Now the matter

has been settled between the parties due to the

intervention of mediators and well wishers of both

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014               2

parties and the de facto complainant does not want to

prosecute the case further. In view of the settlement, no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case as

well. Since it is in the crime stage and non compoundable

offences were included, neither the police nor the court

before whom the case is now pending will not drop further

proceedings.      So they have no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief.

              to call for the records leads to this case and

        to    quash     Annexure      I    proceedings    in

        CrimeNo.2953/2013 Kottarakara Police Station

        now pending before the Hon'ble Judicial 1st Class

        Magistrate Court No.I Kottarakara against the

        petitioners and further proceedings against the

        petitioners in the interest of justice.

      4. The third respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that since they were friends and on

account of some dispute in respect of playing some songs

in the vehicle,        some incident occurred and now the

matter has been settled due to the intervention of

mediators and others and they are working in the same

bus now.        So he does not want to prosecute the

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014        3

petitioners.    He has filed Anneuxre II affidavit stating

these facts as well.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in

view of the settlement,       no purpose will be served

allowing the case to continue.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other

case pending against the petitioners but offence under

Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code is also incorporated

and opposed the application.

      7. Heard both sides.

      8. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by second respondent in respect of an

incident occurred regarding playing of some songs in the

bus in which both the de facto complainant and the

petitioners were working,       Annexure A1 crime was

registered as Crime No.2953/2013 of Kottarakara Police

station against the petitioners alleging offences under

Sections 294(b), 323, 324 and 308 read with Section 34

of the     Indian     Penal Code. The   matter  is  under

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014         4

investigation. In the meantime, it is seen from Annexure

II affidavit that the matter has been settled between the

parties and the de facto complainant does not want to

prosecute the petitioners in view of the settlement arrived

at due to the intervention of well wishers of both parties.

It is true that the offence under Section 308 of the Indian

Penal code is also incorporated. I am not at this stage

going into the question as to whether the allegations are

sufficient to attract the offence under Section 308 of the

Indian Penal Code or not at this stage as the matter has

been settled between the parties. Further, the nature of

injury sustained is also not that grave and it is admitted

fact that both         the petitioners and the de facto

complainant were working in the same bus and on

account of the settlement, their original relationship has

been restored as well as they are now working together in

the same bus.

      9. In view of the settlement there is no possibility of

either the de facto complainant or his witnesses to

support or co-operate with the investigation and filing the

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014             5

final report itself will be difficult. Even assuming that on

the basis of available evidence,          if final report is filed,

they will not support the case of prosecution as well at

the time of trial and conviction of such cases will be

remote.

       10. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or

      F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent

      jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

      given to a criminal court for compounding the

      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

      of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

      has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

      engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of

      justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any

      Court.    In what cases power to quash the criminal

      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised

      where the offender and victim have settled their

      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances

      of each case and no category can be prescribed.

      However, before exercise of such power, the High

      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014             6

      of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,

      cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or

      victim's family and the offender have settled the

      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and

      have serious impact on society.         Similarly, any

      compromise between the victim and offender in

      relation to the offences under special statutes like

      Prevention    of  Corruption   Act   or  the   offences

      committed by public servants while working in that

      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for

      quashing     criminal  proceedings    involving    such

      offences.       But   the    criminal  cases    having

      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

      stand on different footing for the purposes of

      quashing, particularly the offences arising from

      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership

      or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

      disputes where the wrong is basically private or

      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

      entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court

      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

      because of the compromise between the offender and

      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and

      bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

      accused to great oppression and prejudice and

      extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

      words, the High Court must consider whether it would

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014            7

      be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation

      of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to

      abuse of process of law despite settlement and

      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and

      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the

      answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the

      High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

      quash the criminal proceeding."



      11. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the petitioners

and the third respondent are employees in the same bus

and the matter has been settled between the parties and

on account of settlement, their original relationship has

been restored and there is no possibility of conviction

even if ultimately the final report is filed, this court feels

that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of

the code can be invoked to quash the proceedings in

order to promote the restoration of relationship that has

been caused on account of the settlement and the

pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the

Crl.M.C.No.2785 of 2014        8

same.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.2953/2013 of Kottarakara Police Station        as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -I, Kottarakara to

inform the same to the Kottarakara Police Station for

necessary further action in this regard immediately.

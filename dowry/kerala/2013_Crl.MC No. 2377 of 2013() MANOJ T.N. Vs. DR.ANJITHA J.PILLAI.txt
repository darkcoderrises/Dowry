                 Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013
                   -------------------------------
           Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013.


                           O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.

578/2013 of South E.T. Police Station on the file of the Addl.

Chief  Judicial   Magistrate      court    (Economic Offences),

Ernakulam, for the offences punishable under Sections 498

(A), 406, 420 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure 1 proceedings, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.     The allegation in the above case is that, the de

facto complainant who is the 1st respondent herein filed a

complaint before the court of Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate

court (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, which was forwarded

to South E.T. Police Station, Ernakulam, based upon which

Crime No. 578/2013 has been registered for the offences

                                2
Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


punishable under sections 498(A), 406, 420 r/w 34 of I.P.C.

and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the 1st

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and she has no grievance against

them.

         6.        I  have carefully considered   the  above

                                3
Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 498(A),

406, 420 r/w 34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties

to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.      From the submission made by the

counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

                                   4
Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]                  and Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code.      Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
         such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

                "......... But the   criminal   cases    having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership
         or such like transactions or the offences arising out
         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
         disputes where the wrong is basically private or
         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice and
         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


         quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court

has held as follows:-

                "7.    It is not in dispute that matrimonial
         disputes have been on considerable increase in recent
         times resulting in filing of complaints under Sections
         498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband
         but also against the relatives of the husband. The
         question is when such matters are resolved either by
         the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or
         by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for
         which both the sides approached the High Court and
         jointly    prayed   for   quashing   of   the   criminal
         proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife
         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the
         prayer can be declined on the sole ground that since
         the offences are non-compoundable under Section
         320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the
         court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or
         complaint.
                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand
         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint
         under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3
         and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the
         help and intervention of family members, friends and
         well-wishers, the parties concerned have amicably
         settled     their   differences    and    executed    a
         compromise/settlement.         Pursuant   thereto,  the
         appellants filed the said compromise before the Trial
         Court with a request to place the same on record and
         to drop the       criminal  proceedings against     the
         appellants herein.    It is also not in dispute that in
         additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the
         parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit
         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal
         proceedings     against   the   appellants   and   fully
         supported the contents of the settlement deed. It is
         the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial
         Court rejected such prayer of the parties but also the
         High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction under

                                   6
Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


         Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the
         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable
         under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
         compoundable in nature."
                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to
         encourage     genuine   settlements    of   matrimonial
         disputes, particularly,   when     the  same   are on
         considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes
         and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled
         the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold
         that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,
         Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the
         exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
         subsequent criminal proceedings.
                13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
         disputes in recent times. The institution of marriage
         occupies an important place and it has an important
         role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
         should be made in the interest of the individuals in
         order to enable them to settle down in life and live
         peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults
         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
         agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law,
         in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
         matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to
         state that the power under Section 482 should be
         exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
         when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material
         on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that
         the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought
         to be quashed."

Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings

are initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose

among the parties and both the disputes are now amicably

                              7
Crl.M.C.No.2377 of 2013


settled between the parties. In my view, in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case.    According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.        It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution, resulting the conviction of

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - 1 and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in Crime No. 578/2013 of South E.T. Police

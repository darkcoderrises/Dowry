              R.P.(F.C) No.240 of 2013

       Dated this the 5th day of November, 2013


                         ORDER



     The revision petitioner is the respondent in MC No.64

of 2007 on the files of Family Court, Nedumangad. He is

the husband of the 1st respondent and father of the 2nd

respondent who is a minor aged 2 years only. They filed

the above petition under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.

seeking    maintenance    allowance    from  the   revision

petitioner. According to the 1st respondent she is legally

wedded wife of the revision petitioner and the 2nd

respondent is the child born in that wedlock. The marriage

was solemnized on 09/02/2004. It is averred that she was

subjected to cruelty and harassment on demand of more

dowry by the revision petitioner. In the meanwhile, he

left the country on 19/05/2004 and thereafter there was

no communication from him. Thus the revision petitioner

has been neglecting and refused to pay maintenance

allowance form 2004 onwards. She has no job or income.

R.P.(F.C) No.240 of 2013        2

She is depending upon her parents for livelihood but he

revision petitioner is employed abroad and having more

than Rs.50,000/-       as salary. Hence she prayed for an

order directing him to pay maintenance allowance         @

Rs.4,000/- to       1st respondent  and    2,000/- to 2nd

respondent. The court below after considering the

evidence on record allowed the above prayer as such.

This order is under challenge in this revision petition.

      2. The revision petitioner admitted his marriage with

1st respondent and also the paternity of the child. But he

denied the allegations of cruelty and harassment alleged

to have been meeted out by him. According to him the 1st

respondent is not interested in leading a matrimonial life

with him. He is not having an income of Rs.50,000/- as

alleged by the 1st respondent.

      3. In view of the rival contentions, the question to

be considered is whether there is any illegality or

impropriety in the impugned order directing the Revision

Petitioner to pay the maintenance allowance @ Rs.4,000/-

R.P.(F.C) No.240 of 2013       3

to the 1st respondent and Rs.2,000/- to the 2nd

respondent.      The   learned counsel  for   the   revision

petitioner points out that either in the pleadings or in

evidence,     the respondent has no case of future

maintenance. Her claim was limited to in evidence that

she claims maintenance allowance till 20/01/2009, that is,

the date of divorce and the 2nd respondent wants

maintenance allowance from the revision petitioner

without limiting the period.    Therefore, the court below

went wrong by granting maintenance allowance @ Rs.

4,000/- to the 1st respondent beyond the period from

20/01/2009.       Per contra, the learned counsel for the

respondents submits that it is only a slip of the time or a

mistake      while adducing   evidence and totality of the

evidence indicate that she wants maintenance allowance

without limiting the same to a particular period.      But,

going by the pleadings as well as evidence, I am unable

to accept the arguments advanced by the learned counsel

for the respondents.

R.P.(F.C) No.240 of 2013     4

      4. Going by paragraph 17 of the petition, it is seen

that she has not clarified whether her claim is for a

limited period or unlimited period. But, in evidence, she

clarified that she claims maintenance allowance till

20/01/2009 only. If that be of the matter, I am of the

opinion that after 20/01/2009, she is not entitled to get

maintenance allowance from the revision petitioner in this

proceedings. The next point survives for consideration is

whether the court below can be justified in determining

the quantum of maintenance allowance. It is admitted

that the petitioner was working abroad. As far as the 2nd

respondent is concerned, she is a minor studying at

school level. Though the revision petitioner contended

that 1st respondent is working in a computer centre and

getting Rs.3000/- per month, no evidence had been

adduced to prove the said contention. So it can be held

that 1st respondent has no job or income. 2nd respondent

is a minor studying at school level. Certainly she is in

need of money for her food, cloth, medical treatment and

R.P.(F.C) No.240 of 2013         5

educational expense. She is the daughter of an NRI,

working in Gulf Country. The minor child also has the

right to live with the standard of life at par, with as that

her father.

      5. Having regard to the standard of life and present

living cost, I am of the opinion that the direction to pay

Rs.4,000/- to the 1st respondent and Rs.2,000/- to the 2nd

respondent is just and proper and the determination of

the quantum of maintenance does not call for any

interference under revisional jurisdiction.    But it is made

clear that 1st respondent is entitled to get maintenance

allowance till 20-01-2009 only.

      This revision petition is allowed in part.

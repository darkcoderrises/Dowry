                     Crl.M.C No.2948 OF 2012
           -------------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 4th day of December, 2012


                                 ORDER



      Petitioner is the accused in a pending case on the file of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Cherthala. He is being

prosecuted on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,

Muhamma Police Station for the offence punishable under Section

498 A of the Indian Penal Code. Crime in the above case was

registered on the complaint filed by the second respondent, who

is none other than the wife of the petitioner, imputing

matrimonial cruelty and harassment demanding dowry. Now, the

spouses have settled all disputes and they are living together, is

the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused

to seek the exercise of inherent powers of this court to quash the

criminal proceedings against him. Learned counsel appearing for

the second respondent/wife also endorsed the submissions made

Crl.M.C No.2948 OF 2012

                                2




as above.      Learned Public Prosecutor, who was directed to

ascertain and report correctness of the representation made as

above, has also reported, after getting instructions, that spouses

are now living under the common roof resolving all their

matrimonial disputes. In such circumstances, I find, continuation

of the criminal proceedings against the husband, that too on a

complaint giving rise to a report by the police, at the instance of

the wife, would only result in rupturing the renewed matrimonial

relationship of the spouses. Though the offence imputed falling

under    Section     498A  of   the    Indian   Penal    Code    is

non-compoundable, having regard to the guidelines given by the

Apex court in "Gian Singh v State of Punjab" (2012(4) KLT

108) and also taking note that the crime has been registered on

account of the matrimonial disputes between the spouses and it

has now been settled amicably by them, with both of them living

together, the criminal proceedings against the petitioner/husband

have to be terminated to advance the ends of justice. In that view

of the matter, criminal proceedings against the petitioner/accused

in C.C No.713 of 2012 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court - II, Cherthala are quashed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.



      Petition is disposed of.

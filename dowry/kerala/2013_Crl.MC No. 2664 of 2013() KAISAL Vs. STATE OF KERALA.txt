             ----------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.No.2664 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 1st day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who is accused in Crime No.1163 of 2012 of

Kasaragod Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 324 and 341 of I.P.C with a prayer to quash

Annexure-A1 final report and all further proceedings against

the petitioners in Crime No.1163 of 2012 of Kasaragod police

station as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that at about 1

p.m on 30.09.2012, the petitioner/accused attacked the de

facto complainant with a stick on his head and thereby caused

injury to him and accordingly committed the offences

punishable under Sections 341 and 324 of IPC and now, the

case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the second respondent.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

Crl.M.C.No.2664 of 2013            2

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.             Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings. Annexure-A2 is the affidavit

sworn into by the de facto complainant, who is the second

respondent herein.

            5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received          from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him

and stating the said fact she had sworn into Annexure-A2

affidavit.

            6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

            7.      Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No.2664 of 2013              3

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 324 and 341 of I.P.C which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                     "57. The position that emerges from
            the above discussion can be summarised
            thus:      the power of the High Court in
            quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
            complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
            power      given  to   a  criminal   court  for
            compounding the offences under S.320 of
            the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
            plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
            has to be exercised in accord with the
            guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
            secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
            abuse of the process of any Court. In what

Crl.M.C.No.2664 of 2013             4

            cases      power   to  quash   the   criminal
            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
            exercised where the offender and victim
            have settled their dispute would depend on
            the facts and circumstances of each case
            and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

             "......... But the criminal cases having
             overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
             flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes    of   quashing, particularly the
             offences arising from commercial, financial,
             mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
             transactions or the offences arising out of
             matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
             family disputes where the wrong is basically
             private or personal in nature and the
             parties have resolved their entire dispute.
             In this category of cases, High Court may
             quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
             because of the compromise between the
             offender and victim, the possibility of
             conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
             continuation of criminal case would put
             accused to great oppression and prejudice
             and extreme injustice would be caused to
             him by not quashing the criminal case
             despite    full and complete settlement and
             compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

Crl.M.C.No.2664 of 2013          5

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

            In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - AI Final Report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in Crime No.1163 of 2012 of Kasaragod

police station and all further proceedings thereto.

                         Crl.M.C. No.1022 of 2014
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 7th day of February, 2014


                                    O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioners,     who          are         the         accused             persons in

C.C.No.2477/2013 (Crime No.418/2013 of Mattancherry

Police Station) to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

composition entered into between them under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the

'Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that, they are

accused Nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.2477/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kochi. The case

was originated on the basis of a crime registered as Crime

No.418/2013 of Mattancherry Police Station, on the basis of

the statement given by the 2nd respondent herein, alleging

offences under Section 323, 324 and 34 of Indian Penal

Code.   After investigation, the investigating officer filed

final report before the court and learned magistrate has

Crl.M.C. No.1022 of 2014
                                2

taken cognizance of the case as C.C.2477/2013 and that is

pending before that court. Now the matter has been settled

between the parties. No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case. The petitioners and 2nd

respondent are close neighbours and now they are living in

harmony. Since some of the offences are non-compoundable

in nature, they cannot apply to the court below for

withdrawal of the case or compounding the case. So they

have no other option but to approach this court to quash the

proceedings, invoking the power under Section 482 of the

'Code'. Hence the petition.

            3.    The   2nd  respondent   appeared    through

counsel and submitted that, he has no objection in allowing

the application as the matter has been settled between the

parties. The 2nd respondent has filed an affidavit to that

effect also.     I have called for the report from the learned

Public Prosecutor, as to the criminal antecedent of the

petitioners.      Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

except this case there is no other case and they have no

Crl.M.C. No.1022 of 2014
                                 3

criminal background. But however opposed the application.

            4.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Annexure-A1 first

information report was registered by the Mattancherry

police as Crime No.418/2013 of that police station, alleging

offences under Section 323, 324 and Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code. It is also an admitted fact that after

investigation, the investigating officer filed Annexure-A2

final report before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

II, Kochi, and the case was taken on file by that court as

C.C.No.2477/2013 and that is pending before that court. In

the meantime, the matter has been settled between the

parties.

            5.    It is mentioned in the petition that, the

petitioners and 2nd respondent are neighbours and now they

are living in harmony and that fact was admitted by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent as well. The 2nd respondent

also filed an affidavit admitting the settlement of disputes

between the parties and expressing his willings to quash the

Crl.M.C. No.1022 of 2014
                                    4

proceedings as they are now living in harmony.                  In the

decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been observed as follows:

      "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
      its view, because of the compromise between the offender
      and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
      and continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
      be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim.   In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation of the criminal proceedings would tantamount
      to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
      criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Since the matter has been settled between the parties and

they are neighbours and the settlement will promote the

harmony and peace between the neighbours, the settlement

has to be honoured by this court. Further being a settled

Crl.M.C. No.1022 of 2014
                                   5

matter, there is no possibility of the case being ending in

conviction, as the defacto-complainant and witnesses are

not going to support the case and no purpose will be served

by retaining the case on record. So in view of the above

circumstances, I feel that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of the 'Code' has to be invoked to quash

the proceedings.        So the application is allowed and the

proceedings in C.C. No.2477/2013 (Crime No.418/2013 of

Mattancherry Police Station), pending before the Judicial

First    Class    Magistrate     Court-II,   Kochi,  is   quashed,

recording the composition entered into between the

petitioners and the 2nd respondent. Office is directed to

communicate         this  order     to    the  concerned      court,

immediately for further necessary action.

           Dated this the 5th day of June, 2015

                            ORDER

    This revision petition is preferred against the judgment

in  C.C.No.421/1999      of    Chief     Judicial    Magistrate,

Pathanamthitta.      The revision petitioner is the defacto

complainant and respondents 1 and 2 are the accused in the

above case. The defacto complainant's allegation was that

the accused with the common intention, demanded more

money as dowry and they misappropriated a sum of 

2,80,000/- from the Fixed Deposit of PW1 and subjected her

to cruelty, thereby committed offence punishable u/s.406

and 498A r/w.34 IPC.        The trial Court examined PW1 to

PW5 and marked Exts.P1 to P6. Ext.D1 was marked on the

Crl.R.P. No.932/2003           2

side of the accused.      The incriminating circumstances

brought out in evidence were denied by the accused, while

questioning them u/s.313 Cr.P.C.    The trial Court, after

sifting and weighing the evidence on record, acquitted the

accused in the above case.      Against that, this revision

petition preferred.

      2.      After filing this revision petition, several

directions were given to the revision petitioner to take

steps against respondents 1 and 2. Even after such

direction, no steps were taken by the revision petitioner. I

have perused the judgment of the Court below.           The

evidence was properly anlaysed by the trial Court. In view

of the above discussion of the trial Court, I am of the

opinion that the trial Court has rightly acquitted the

accused for offence punishable u/s.498A and 406 r/w. 34

Crl.R.P. No.932/2003           3

IPC. Therefore, there is no merit in this revision petition

and it is dismissed accordingly.




                                 P.D. RAJAN, JUDGE.

               ---------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No.3436 OF 2013
              ---------------------------------------
          Dated this the 16th day of August, 2013.


                           O R D E R



                   The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance    of    the   petitioners,   who    are    accused  in

C.C.No.305/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court

-II, Hosdurg which is a case instituted upon the police report

[in Crime No. 87/2012 of Neeleswaram Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Sections 143,147,341,323,294(b),

427 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code with a prayer to quash

Annexure A2 final report filed before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court -II, Hosdurg in CC 305/2012 as the matter

is settled out of court.

         2.     The case of the prosecution is that when the

second respondent was trying to take the photographs of the

construction of tombs, the petitioners unlawfully assembled

and in pursuance of the common object, committed mischief

and assaulted the second respondent. Thus, according to the

prosecution, the petitioners are committed the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 294(b), 427

Crl.M.C. No.3436 OF 2013
                               2

read with 149 of Indian Penal Code.       Now the case of the

petitioners is that while the above case is pending due to the

intervention of the mediators, the matter has been settled

amicably and according to the de facto complainant who is the

second respondent sworn in Annexure-A4 affidavit particularly,

in view of the settlement arrived through the mediation

conducted as per the common judgment of this court in WPC

No. 5959/2012 and WPC No 402/2012 .

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

Crl.M.C. No.3436 OF 2013
                                3

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143,147,341,323,294(b),

427 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.     It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

Crl.M.C. No.3436 OF 2013
                                       4

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                   "57.   The position that emerges from the

           above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

           power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

           inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

           the power given to a criminal court for compounding

           the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

           power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

           the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

           the process of any Court. In what cases power to

           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

           may be exercised where the offender and victim

           have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

           and circumstances of each case and no category can

           be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But    the    criminal    cases    having

           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

           stand on different footing for the purposes of

           quashing, particularly the offences arising from

           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

           or such like transactions or the offences arising out

           of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

           disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved

           their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

Crl.M.C. No.3436 OF 2013
                                    5

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite         full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

                              6

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A2 final report and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No. 787/2011 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court -II,Hosdurg in Crime No.

87/2012 of Neeleswaram Police Station and all further

proceedings thereto.

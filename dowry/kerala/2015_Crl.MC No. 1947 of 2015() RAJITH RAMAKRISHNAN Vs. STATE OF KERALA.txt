                  Crl.M.C. No. 1947 of 2015
             =======================
              Dated this the 7th day of April, 2015

                          O R D E R




      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.283 of 2011 of the

Parappanangadi Police Station, Malappuram District, registered

for the offence punishable under Section 498A            read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section

482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 Final

Report in Crime No.283 of 2011 of the Parappanangadi Police

Station, Malappuram District and all further proceedings based

on it in C.C.No.1999 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Parappanangadi, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 1947 of 2015
                                 2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

                                   3

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1 FIR

and Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.283 of 2011 of the

Parappanangadi Police Station, Malappuram District and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1999 of 2013 pending

before     the    Judicial    First   Class   Magistrate's  Court,

Parappanangadi, are hereby quashed.

                                      B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE

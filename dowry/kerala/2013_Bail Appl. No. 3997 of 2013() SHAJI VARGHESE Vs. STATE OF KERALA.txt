                   -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 7th day of June, 2013


                              ORDER

      Petitioner is the 1st accused in crime No.503/2013 of

Pandalam Police Station, registered for offences punishable

under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    The above crime was registered on a complaint

given by the wife of petitioner against him, his mother and

sister, imputing matrimonial cruelty that all of them harassed,

intimidated and assaulted her demanding dowry. The crime

registered is now under investigation.

      3.    Learned counsel for petitioner relying on some

Annexures produced with the petition submits that the crime

has been registered on false allegation as a counterblast to

the complaint filed by him before higher Police Officials and

Human Rights Commission over his torture by a Police

Officer, after keeping him in illegal custody. The other two

accused (A2 and A3) have already been granted regular bail

by the magistrate is the further submission of the counsel.

After hearing the counsel for petitioner and also learned

Public Prosecutor and looking into materials produced with

the petition also, I find, arrest and custodial interrogation of

petitioner may not be essential for a fair investigation of the

B.A.No. 3997 of 2013              2




crime. However, he has to co-operate with the investigation.

        In the event of arrest of petitioner by police in

connection with the above crime he is directed to be released

on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- with one

solvent surety for the like sum. Petitioner has to report before

the investigating officer, if his presence is demanded for

completing the investigation of the crime.

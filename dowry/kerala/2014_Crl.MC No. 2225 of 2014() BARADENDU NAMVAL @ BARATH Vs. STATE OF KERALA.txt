    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014
    ==============================
          Dated this, the 21st day of May, 2014.




                            O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the accused in Crime

No.1132/2013        of   Medical     College    Police    Station,

Thiruvananthapuram, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.     It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.1132/2013 of Medical College

Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram which was registered on

the basis of a private complaint filed by the third respondent

before the District Police Chief, Thiruvananthapuram which was

forwarded to the Medical College Police Station through proper

channel against the petitioners alleging offences under Section

420 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 66

(A) & 66(C) of Information Technology Act. The matter has

now been settled between the parties due to the intervention

of mediators and others. In view of the settlement, there is no

possibility of any conviction. Further, some of the offences are

non-compoundable in nature. So, they could not file the

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014          :  2 :

application before the concerned court or before the police.

So, they have no other remedy except to approach this court

seeking the following relief:

           "To call for the records leading to Crime No.1132/2013 of

    the Medical College Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, pending

    before the Hon'ble Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

    Thiruvananthapuram, and quash the entire proceedings on the

    basis of the agreement entered into between the de facto

    complainant and the petitioners and on the basis of the petition

    filed by the de facto complainant for withdrawing the complaint

    and for not further prosecuting the same."

     3.    The third respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties due to the intervention of mediators and he has no

complaint against the petitioners now. Further, he had filed

Annexure 4 affidavit stating these facts. The Counsel for the

petitioners submitted that in view of the settlement, there is

no possibility of any conviction and it is a purely a money

transaction. So, he prayed for allowing the application.

     4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed to this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioners but opposed the application.

    5.     It is an admitted fact that there was some transaction

between the third respondent-de facto complainant and the

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014     :  3 :

petitioners and since that transaction has not materialized,

third respondent filed a complaint before the District Police

Chief, Thiruvananthapuram, alleging that the petitioners have

committed the offence punishable under Section 420 read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and that complaint was

forwarded       to    the  Medical   College    Police  Station,

Thiruvananthapuram within whose jurisdiction the alleged

offence has been committed through proper channel and on

that basis, Medical College Police has registered Annexure A1

First Information Report as Crime No.1132/13 originally under

Section 420 of Indian Penal Code alone against the first

petitioner.    Thereafter, during investigation, it was revealed

that second petitioner also involved in the crime and offences

under Sections 66(A) & 66(C) of Information Technology Act

were also committed and second petitioner was also implicated

as    second     accused  and   above    provisions  were   also

incorporated in the First Information Report. Second petitioner

was granted anticipatory bail by this court as per Annexure A2

order. It is seen from the documents produced that there was

some transaction regarding promise of obtaining Medical

College seat and the same has been now settled between the

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014        :   4 :

parties.    They have entered in to Annexure A3 agreement

regarding this transaction and A4 affidavit was filed by the de

facto complainant stating that the matter has been settled

between the parties and he does not want to proceed with the

case in view of the settlement due to the intervention of

mediators. On going through the allegations, it is seen that it

is some sort of money transaction between the parties.

Further, the prosecutor had submitted that there is no other

case against the petitioners of committing similar offences as

well. In view of the settlement between the parties, there is

no possibility of conviction as well as neither the de facto

complainant nor his witnesses will support the case of the

prosecution.

        6. Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion

      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in

      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014          :   5 :

      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each

      case and no category can be prescribed.      However, before

      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard

      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have

      serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise

      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

      offences committed by public servants while working in that

      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the

      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of

      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

      financial,  mercantile,   civil,   partnership or   such   like

      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating

      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is

      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by

      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014         :  6 :

      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding

      would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

      settlement    and  compromise      between    the  victim  and

      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

      appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer

      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

      be well within its jurisdiction      to quash the criminal

      proceeding."



      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and it is not a case of public

interest but, purely a private transaction between the de facto

complainant and the petitioners and in view of the settlement,

there is no possibility of any conviction, this court feels that, it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

as no purpose will be served by keeping the case any longer.

      8.     So,    the   application      is   allowed     and    further

proceedings in Crime No.1132/13 of Medical College Police

Station, Thiruvananthapuram             as against the petitioners is

hereby quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.2225 of 2014    :  7 :

         Office is directed to communicate this order to the

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram

to inform the same to the concerned Police Station for

necessary further action immediately.

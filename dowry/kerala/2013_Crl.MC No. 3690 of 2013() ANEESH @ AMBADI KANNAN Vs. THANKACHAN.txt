                           V.K. MOHANAN, J.
                   ......................................................
                         CRL.M.C.NO.3690 OF 2013
                   ......................................................
                Dated this the 30th day of August, 2013

                                 O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused Nos.1 and 2 in

S.C.No.231/2012 on the file of the 2nd Additional Assistant

Sessions Court, Ernakulam which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No.731/2011 of                          Hill Palace Police

Station for the offences punishable under Sections 447,341,323

and 308 read with Section 34 of IPC with a prayer to quash

Annexure-1 final report pending as S.C.No.231/2012 on the file

of the 2nd Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Ernakulam as

the matter is settled out of court.

     2. The allegation in the above case is that out of                        the

animosity, the accused persons trespassed into the property

of the defacto complainant at about 8.50 p.m on 20.3.2011

and the first accused caught hold of the defacto complainant

on his   neck and thereby restrained him and the defacto

complainant was put into a well and as a result of which his

head would have been hit against the ring of the well which

would have resulted in his death and                         thus the      accused

                                  2

persons committed the offences punishable under Sections

447, 341,323 and 308 read with Section 34 of IPC. The

present case of the petitioner is that being a neighbour of the

petitioner, the entire dispute is settled with the first respondent,

who is the defacto complainant and          who accordingly sworn

into Annexure A3 affidavit.

      3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 1st respondent.     I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that,

during the pendency of the above case the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in

the above case       is an abuse of the process of law and

proceedings.

      5.   The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of the specific instruction received        from the first

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the de

facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further against

the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

      6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

                                  3

the respective counsel.      I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-III affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Sections 447, 341,323 and 308 read with Section

34 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the first

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57. The position that emerges from the

                                  4

         above discussion can be summarised thus: the

         power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

         exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences

         under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of

         wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

         it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

         abuse of the process of any Court. In what

         cases power to quash the criminal proceeding

         or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their

         dispute would depend on the facts and

         circumstances of each case and no category

         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But  the  criminal  cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes    of   quashing,   particularly   the

          offences      arising   from      commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil,  partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences arising

          out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

                                 5

        family disputes where the wrong is basically

        private or personal in nature and the parties

        have resolved their entire dispute.      In this

        category of cases, High Court may quash

        criminal proceedings if in its view, because of

        the compromise between the offender and

        victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

        and bleak and continuation of criminal case

        would put accused to great oppression and

        prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal

        case despite full and complete settlement and

        compromise with the victim........"

        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute.   It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

                                  6

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.    Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C.is allowed, quashing Annexure

-I final report and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in S.C.No.231/2012 on the file of the 2nd Additional

Assistant Sessions Court, Ernakulam          in Crime No.731/2011

of Hill Palace Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

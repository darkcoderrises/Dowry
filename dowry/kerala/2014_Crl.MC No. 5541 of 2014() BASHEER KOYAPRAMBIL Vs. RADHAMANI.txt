                Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
      Dated this the 30th day of September, 2014.


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in

C.C.No.2226 of 2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Alappuzha, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No.1186 of 2013 of Alappuzha

South Police Station] for the offences punishable under

Sections 294(b), 353, 506(1) and 509 of I.P.C. with a prayer

to quash Annexure-I FIR and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in the above crime, as the

matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

3.8.2013 at around 10.30 a.m., the petitioner/accused who

is  Municipal    Councilor      at    Alappuzha    Municipality

Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                               2

intimidated and threatened the 1st respondent inside the

chamber of Municipal Secretary, Alappuzha Municipality,

by saying that she is a corrupt person and she lodged a

complaint before the Alappuzha South Police Station

against the petitioner. Now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, which

is the subject matter of the above case, as per Annexure II

copy of the compromise reached in, signed by 1st

respondent and petitioner, and as per Annexure III affidavit

sworn into by the 1st respondent/de facto complainant.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                                3

         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

against the petitioner.

         6.        I  have carefully considered    the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 294(b),

353, 506(1) and 509 of I.P.C. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                                    4

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the   power    given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
         what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                                   5

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

Crl.M.C.No.5541 of 2014
                              6

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.        Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-I FIR and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioner in C.C.No. 2226 of 2013 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha, pursuant to Crime

No.1186 of 2013 of Alappuzha South Police Station.

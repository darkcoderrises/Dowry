               -----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 16th day of April, 2013

                              O R D E R

           The petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.

422/2013 of Adimali Police Station registered at the instance of

Sheeba, the wife of the petitioner's son Arshad alleging commission

of offences under Section 498-A, 406 and 420 r/w Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. On 21.02.2004 the petitioner's son Arshad

married the defacto complainant. The aforesaid crime was

registered based on Annexure-4 complaint lodged by the defacto

complainant, Sheeba. The contention of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner is that the petitioner has been falsely

implicated in the aforesaid crime and that there is no specific

accusation against the petitioner except to the extent       that he

harassed the defacto complainant mentally by demanding dowry. In

fact, that allegation is also very vague, it is contended. As already

noticed hereinbefore the marriage between the son of the petitioner

and the defacto complainant, Sheeba was conducted as early as

21.02.2004 and Annexure-4 complaint was made only on 7.3.2013.

Evidently, no specific accusation has been made against the

petitioner. The allegation against him is that he used to say that

B.A.No. 2517 of 2013
                                    2

proper dowry was not fetched by her and that by saying so he

mentally harassed the defacto complainant.

            2.   I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and also the learned Public Prosecutor. Considering the allegations

in Annexure-4 complaint and also the rival submissions I am

inclined to allow this petition and hence, it is ordered as

hereunder:-

i) The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating Officer in

the aforesaid crime within a week from today. Upon such surrender

before the Investigating Officer he shall be interrogated and he shall

then be enlarged on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.20,000/-

(Rupees Twenty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for

the like to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer.

ii) The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as

and when required by the Investigating officer.

Iii) The petitioner shall not interfere with the investigation or

intimidate or influence      the witnesses. He shall not tamper or

attempt to tamper with the evidence.




                                                      Sd/-


                                         C.T.RAVIKUMAR,JUDGE.

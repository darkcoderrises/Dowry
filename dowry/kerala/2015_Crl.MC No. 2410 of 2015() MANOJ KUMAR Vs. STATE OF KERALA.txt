                     Crl.M.C.No.2410 Of 2015
          --------------------------------------------------
           DATED THIS THE 28th DAY OF APRIL, 2015

                               ORDER

       Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.841/14 of

Kothamangalam Police Station, Ernakualam district. The offences

alleged against the petitioner are under Sections 498A, 323, 341

and 506(2) of Indian Penal Code. Now, it is submitted on behalf of

the petitioner that the entire disputes between the petitioner and

the second respondent have already been settled and they jointly

filed an affidavit which is produced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure

4. Therefore, the prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire

proceedings in Crime No.841/2014 of Kothamangalam Police

Station.

      2.    Heard, the learned counsel for petitioner, learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned

counsel for the second respondent.

      3.    In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

CRL.M.C.No.2410/15                 -2-


inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given

to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section

320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is of wide

plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz.; (i) to

secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process

of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the

offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on

the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be

prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

CRL.M.C.No.2410/15               -3-


or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on

a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where

the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of

cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,

because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,

the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

CRL.M.C.No.2410/15               -4-


proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

committed offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 341

and 506(2) of Indian Penal Code.

      5.    Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioner and the second respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second

respondent has also stated that the second respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioner.

The petitioner and the second respondent jointly filed an affidavit

also before this Court as Annexure 4 in this regard. It is also

submitted that they are now residing together.

      6.    In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

CRL.M.C.No.2410/15              -5-


proceedings pending against the petitioner in Crime No.841/14 of

Kothamangalam Police Station, Ernakualam district can be

quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid

down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in Crime No.841/14 of Kothamangalam Police

Station, Ernakualam district against the petitioner is quashed.

            ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 1st day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is accused in L.P.No.2 of 2011 in

S.C.No.183 of 2008 of the Principal Assistance Sessions court,

Kozhikode which is a case instituted upon the police report [in

Crime No.96 of 2002 of Town Police Station, Kozhikode] for

the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452,

341, 506(ii), 307 r/w 149 of I.P.C with a prayer to quash all

further proceedings against the petitioner/accused in L.P.No.2

of 2011 in S.C.No.183 of 2008 on the files of Principal

Assistance Sessions Court, Kozhikode in Crime No.96 of 2002

of Town Police Station, Kozhikode as the matter is settled out

of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that on

09.05.2002 at 3 p.m the accused persons 6 in number formed

themselves into an unlawful assembly armed with deadly

weapons and trespassed into the Queens Bar at Kozhikode,

and wrongly restrained the prosecution witnesses and

assaulted them and attempted to commit murder and thus the

Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013         2

accused has committed the offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 148 452, 341, 506(ii), 307 r/w 149 of IPC. Now the

case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court

between himself and the de facto complainant who is the

second respondent herein and other injured               namely

respondents 3 and 4. It is also the case of the petitioner that

the other accused in the very same case of prosecution i.e., in

S.C.No.824 of 2003 of the court of Sessions, Kozhikode

Division faced the trial but by judgment dated 26.02.2008 in

the above Sessions Case they were acquitted as the all injured

witness including the de facto complainant are turned hostile.

Therefore, the counsel seeks an order quashing of proceedings

pending against him in L.P.2/11 in S.C.No.183 of 2008 of the

Prl.Asst.Sessions Court, Kozhikode. In the light of the above

submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, I have

perused Annexure-2 judgment and in paragraph 9 of the same

the learned Sessions Judge has found that Pws.1 to 16 who

are the injured turned hostile stating that they do not know

who attacked them and those witnesses failed to identify the

accused. The independent witnesses also do not support the

prosecution case. If that be so, no purpose would be served in

Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013             3

sending the petitioner to face the trial.           The de facto

complainant and the injured have filed Annexure A-3, A4 and

A5 affidavits respectively before this Court and now, the case

of the petitioner/s is that the matter is settled out of court.

              3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as respondents 2 to 4.         I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

              4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.               Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

              5. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4 who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondents, who are the

de facto complainant/victim/injured do not intend to proceed

any further against the petitioner and they have no grievance

against him.

              6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013               4

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

              7.       Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 341,

506(ii), 307 r/w 149 of I.P.C which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the respondents 2 to 4, it appears to me that the

injured/the victim/the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioner accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013                5

                       "57. The position that emerges from
              the above discussion can be summarised
              thus:      the power of the High Court in
              quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
              complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
              jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
              power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
              compounding the offences under S.320 of
              the Code.        Inherent power is of wide
              plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
              has to be exercised in accord with the
              guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
              secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
              abuse of the process of any Court. In what
              cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
              proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
              exercised where the offender and victim
              have settled their dispute would depend on
              the facts and circumstances of each case
              and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

              "......... But the criminal cases having
              overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
              flavour stand on different footing for the
              purposes      of  quashing,  particularly   the
              offences arising from commercial, financial,
              mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
              transactions or the offences arising out of
              matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
              family disputes where the wrong is basically
              private or personal in nature and the
              parties have resolved their entire dispute.
              In this category of cases, High Court may
              quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
              because of the compromise between the
              offender and victim, the possibility of
              conviction     is  remote    and    bleak  and
              continuation of criminal case would put
              accused to great oppression and prejudice

Crl.M.C.No.2667 of 2013              6

              and extreme injustice would be caused to
              him by not quashing the criminal case
              despite    full and complete settlement and
              compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

              In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in L.P.No.2

of 2011 in S.C.No.183 of 2008 of the Principal Asst. Sessions

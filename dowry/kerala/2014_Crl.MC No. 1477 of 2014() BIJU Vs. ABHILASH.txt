                       Crl.M.C.No.1477 of 2014
                    ..................................................
               Dated this the 7th day of March, 2014.

                                 O R D E R

      This is an application filed by the accused in C.C.No.6/2012,

who are the     original accused           Nos.7       to 9      and   14 in Crime

No.531/2008 of Aranmula police station now pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta to quash the

proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at between the

parties under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are accused

Nos. 7 to 9 and 14 in Crime No.531/2008 of Aranamula police station

now pending as C.C.No.6/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta. The case was registered on the

basis of a statement given by defacto complainant/injured against

18 accused persons including the present petitioners and a crime

was registered as Crime No.531/2008 of Aranmula police station as

Annexure A1 and after investigation, Annexure A2 final report was

filed alleging the offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 452,

324 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code. The case was originally taken

on file as C.C.No.38/2009 and accused Nos 1 to 6, 10 to 13, 15 to

18 had appeared in that case and in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the case against them was quashed by this

Crl.M.C.No.1477 of 2014                    2

Court as per Annexure A3 order in Crl.M.C.No.3900/2011. Now the

dispute between the petitioners and respondents 2 to 5 who are

Cws     1  to 4 were also settled             and     there is   no possibility of

conviction. Since some of the offences are non compoundable                     in

nature, they could not      approach the lower court for compounding

the case. They have no other option except to approach this Court

seeking the following relief:




            In the above said circumstance it is most humbly prayed
            that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash
            Annexure A2 final report in Crime No.531/2008 of
            Aranmula Police Station and all other proceedings in
            C.C.No.6/2012 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I,
            Pathanamthitta by allowing this Criminal Miscellaneous
            Case in the better interest of justice and equity.

      3. Respondents 2 to 5 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and they have no objection in quashing the proceedings.                       The

counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of the

settlement there is no possibility of conviction and prayed for

allowing the application.

       4. The learned          Public Prosecutor, on instructions,             as

directed by this Court, submitted that the present petitioners

are accused in several cases and those cases arose out of

a clash between Dy.F.I and RSS activists and opposed the

Crl.M.C.No.1477 of 2014           3

application for quashing.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the defacto complainant, Annexure A1 crime was

registered against 18 accused persons including the petitioners

and after investigation Annexure A2 final report was filed. It is

also an admitted fact that except the present petitioners, case

against other accused persons was quashed by this Court as

per Annexure A3 order on the basis of the settlement arrived

at between the parties. It is true that now a days without any

reason or motive unmerited political clashes are occurred

between lower wing of the political parties. Youngsters are

being    spoiled on account of the provocation made by the

political bosses without knowing the consequences of the acts

or its impact on their future. It goes beyond their hands and

at last some of them become criminals as well. Some of them

even involve in such activities under the cover of political

ideology. However, considering the fact that in this case the

matter has been settled between the       workers of two political

parties and      brought harmony in the locality and      the case

against other accused persons has been quashed by this Court

on the ground of       settlement, there is no possibility of any

Crl.M.C.No.1477 of 2014             4

conviction being entered against the petitioners even if trial is

allowed to proceed with.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

      "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
      its view, because of the compromise between the offender
      and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
      and continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
      be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim.   In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation of the criminal proceedings would tantamount
      to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
      criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also in view of the fact that case against most of the accused

were quashed by this Court on the ground of settlement and it

Crl.M.C.No.1477 of 2014            5

is   alleged that political harmony has been restored in the

locality due to the settlement, this Court feels that this is a

fit case where the power under Section 482 has to be invoked

to   quash the proceedings       as no purpose will be served in

allowing the prosecution to continue in view of the settlement

arrived at between the parties. So this petition is allowed and

further proceeding      in  C.C.No.6/2012        on   the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -I, Pathanamthitta as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is    directed to    communicate       this order to the

concerned court for necessary further action immediately.

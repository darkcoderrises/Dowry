            ------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 6th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

accused Nos. 1 to 6 in C.C.773/12 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur, to quash the

proceedings, recording the composition entered into

between the petitioners and the injured persons, including

the defacto-complainant under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that the

petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 6 in C.C.No.773/12 on the

file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. The

case was originated on the basis of a crime registered by

the Nenmara Police as Crime No.361/2011 of Nenmara

Police Station, alleging offences under Section 143, 147,

148, and 324 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code. The prosecution allegation was that on 13.10.2011, at

Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
                              2

about 12.30, hours the accused formed themselves into an

unlawful assembly and beat the defacto-complainant with

bamboo sticks due to the animosity in connection with a

clash between Kerala Students Union by the Students

Federation of India students.       After investigation, final

report has been filed and the case has been taken on the file

by the learned magistrate as C.C.No.773/2012. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. They have

realised their mistake and now settled in their life. The

pending case will affect their future prospects. Since some

of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they

cannot file a compounding application before the concerned

court. So they have no other option but to seek the

intervention of this court, to quash the proceedings, after

recording composition under Section 482 of the 'Code'.

Hence the petition.

            3.    The respondents 1 to 7, who are the defacto-

complainant and injured in the case, appeared through

counsel and also filed affidavits supporting the case of the

Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
                              3

petitioners.

            4.    Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,

who opposed the application.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, while the

petitioners and respondents 1 to 7 were studying in N.S.S.

College, Nenmara, there occurred a clash in connection

with some incident between two group of students political

organisation and the police has registered case and counter

case against the petitioners and respondents 1 to 7 in

respect of that incident. Both petitioners and respondents 1

to 7 represented one fraction or other of the political

student's union. The matter has been settled between the

parties now. They have completed their studies and settled

in life.    It is quite unfortunate that, the students now

without going the consequences of their act, on some

fanciful aspiration to become leaders in a political party

involve in such activities. Further they also did not know

the pains taken by their parents, for educating them, by

spending their harder earned money. These things were

Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
                               4

done by the students in fact at the instigation of political

parties, without knowing the fact that, it will affect their

future.

            6.    However, though it is in the nature of a

political issue, considering the fact that the poor students

without knowing the consequences have involved in such

activities and the pendency of these cases are likely to

affect their future and also considering the fact that they

have now repenting for what they have done, I feel that, it

can be treated as an exceptional case where, (though

normally courts should not inclined to invoke the

jurisdiction), this court has to invoke the power to provide

them better prospects in their life, especially when they

have understood their mistake and wanted to rectify them

in future. Further the learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that there is no other criminal case registered and pending

against them except this case. So they do not have any

criminal background as well. In the decision reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)],

Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
                                    5

it has been observed as follows:

      "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
      its view, because of the compromise between the offender
      and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
      and continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
      be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim.   In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation of the criminal proceedings would tantamount
      to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
      criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

In view of the above discussions made and also considering

the fact that things done during the student life has been

realised to be a mistake by the petitioners and the

respondents 1 to 7 and they want to console themselves,

forgetting their political ideologies which they carried

during their college days and want to lead a peaceful life,

after getting good employment for which this could not

Crl.M.C. No.1054 of 2014
                                 6

stand in the way, I feel that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of the 'Code' has to be invoked to quash

the proceedings to make them settle in their life in a proper

and prospective manner.        Further since, the matter has

been settled between the parties, there is no probability of

conviction if it is allowed to proceed with. So this criminal

miscellaneous case is allowed and the proceedings against

the petitioners in C.C.No.773/2012 (Crime No.361/2011 of

Nenmara Police Station) on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Alathur, is quashed.            Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

for appropriate further action.

      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioners except 4 and 6 are accused in Crime No.

489 of 2015 of Thalayolaparamb Police Station. The allegation is

that they subjected to cruelty the victim demanding more dowry.

      3.    Heard.

      4.    There is no allegation that the victim sustained any

serious injuries. It appears that restoration of harmony to the

family is not impossible. So, I am inclined to grant the prayer of

the petitioners except 4 and 6.

      In the result, this application is allowed in part.

    1)The petitioners (except 4 and 6)shall be released on bail

       on their executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty

       five thousand only) each with two solvent sureties each

       for the like sum if they are arrested by the Police in

       connection with this case.

    2)They shall surrender their passports before the lower

       court concerned or if they do not have one, they shall file

       affidavits to that effect within five days of their release.

     3)They shall not leave India without the previous permission

        of the court of enquiry or trial court as the case may be.

    4)They shall appear before the Investigating Officer for

        interrogation if they are so required by him in writing.

     5)They shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the

     6)They shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

     7)They shall not get themselves involved in any other

        criminal case while they are on bail.

            If the petitioners surrender before the Magistrate this

        order is not applicable and the learned Magistrate may

        pass appropriate orders.

          In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the

  learned Magistrate is empowered to cancel the bail in

  accordance with the law.

      This is an application filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure seeking anticipatory bail.

      2.   The petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime

the offence punishable under Section 498(A) of IPC.                     The

prosecution case is that on 14.5.2011 the 1st petitioner had

married the defacto complainant and it is alleged that after the

marriage the 1st petitioner started to harass the defacto

complainant demanding           more     dowry both mentally            and

physically. The complaint was laid down on 2.8.2012.

      3.   Having gone through the records made available it is

felt that this is a fit case where extraordinary jurisdiction can be

exercised in favour of the petitioners.

following directions:

            i)    The petitioners shall surrender before the
      Investigating      Officer     on     19.9.2012,      who      after

     interrogation shall produce them before the JFCM
     concerned      and on application for bail moved by the
     petitioners, the learned Magistrate shall release the
     petitioners on bail on each of them executing a bond for
     a sum of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) with
     two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the
     satisfaction of the said Court.

           ii)    The learned Magistrate shall ensure the
     identity of the sureties and also the veracity of the tax
     receipts before granting bail.

           Iii)   The petitioners shall appear before the
     Investigating Officer concerned for interrogation as and
     when required by him until further orders.

           iv)    The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to
     tamper with the evidence or influence or try to influence
     the witness.

           v)     If any of the condition is violated, the bail
     granted shall stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned,
     on being satisfied of the said fact, may take such
     proceedings as are available to him in law.

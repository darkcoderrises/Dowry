                    B.A. No. 4829 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 1st day of July, 2014


                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   The petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime

No.241/2014 of Sasthamcotta Police Station, which has

been registered for the offence under section 498A of IPC.

He is the husband of the 1st informant.

     3.   The allegation against him is that he, along with

his parents who are co-accused, subjected the 1st informant

to cruelty demanding more dowry and has thus committed

the offence mentioned above.




     4.   It is submitted that the allegations are false and

the petitioner is innocent.

     5.   Heard.

                               -2-



     6.    The petitioner and the 1st informant have been

married only for one year. They resided together only for

four months. They have no children. The first attempt of

the Court should be to restore harmony in the family. If the

petitioner happens to be detained in jail, that may not be

possible.    So, I am inclined to grant the prayer of the

petitioner.




     7.    In the result, this application is allowed.

      i.    The petitioner shall be released on bail on

           his    executing   a  bond    for   Rs.20,000/-

           (Rupees Twenty thousand only) with two

           solvent sureties each for the like sum if he is

           arrested by the Police in connection with this

           case.

      ii.  He shall not contact or communicate with

           the 1st informant without the previous

           permission of the Court.

B.A. No. 4829 of 2014
                              -3-



      iii. He shall not get himself involved in any

           other criminal case while he is on bail.

      iv.   This order is not applicable if the petitioner

           chooses to surrender before the Magistrate

           concerned and in such case the learned

           Magistrate may take appropriate action in

           accordance with the law.

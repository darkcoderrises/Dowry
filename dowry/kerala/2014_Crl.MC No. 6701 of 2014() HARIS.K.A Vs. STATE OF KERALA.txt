                  CRL. M.C. No.6701 of 2014
           ...............................................................
          Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.878/2012 of

the Bekal Police Station, Kasaragod registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I final report in

Crime No. 878/2012 of the Bekal Police Station, Kasaragod

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.713/2013

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,

Hosdurg, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.6701 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



the wife of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more

dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,    who   is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

CRL.M.C.No.6701 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I

final report in Crime No. 878/2012 of the Bekkal Police

Station, Kasaragod and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C.713/2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg, are hereby quashed.

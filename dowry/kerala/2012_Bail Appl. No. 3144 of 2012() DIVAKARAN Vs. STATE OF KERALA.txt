                         C.T.RAVIKUMAR, J.
                       ----------------------------
                         B.A.No.3144 of 2012
                       ----------------------------
                         Dated 18th May, 2012

                                ORDER

            The petitioners are accused Nos. 2 and 3 in Crime No.337 of

2012 of Enath Police Station.       The said crime was registered for

offences punishable under sections 406, 498A and 34 of the Indian

Penal Code. The petitioners are the parents of the first accused.




            2. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioners

demanded more dowry from the defacto complainant for purchasing

property. The defacto complainant is a nurse and she has been working

at Gulf at the time of marriage and even now. Allegation of torture,

both mental and physical, is also levelled against the petitioners.




            3. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

also the learned Public Prosecutor. The case diary was also perused.




            4. The learned Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the

application.  Considering the nature and gravity of the accusation

against the petitioners who are the parents of the first accused and that

they are aged 60 years and 58 years respectively and upon perusing

the case diary I am of the considered view that a custodial interrogation

B.A.No.3144/2012                       2


is not warranted.      I am inclined to dispose of this application as

hereunder:-




        (a) The petitioners shall surrender before the Investigating

             Officer within seven days from today.


          (b) After interrogation, the petitioners shall be released on bail

              on their executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- each with two

              solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of

              the Investigating Officer.


          (c) The petitioners shall report before the Investigating Officer

              once in a month for a period of three months and

              thereafter, as and when required by the Investigating

              Officer till the final report is filed.


        (d) The petitioners shall not interfere with the investigation or

             intimidate or influence the witnesses. They shall not tamper

             or attempt to tamper, with the evidence.




                                                     Sd/-
                                              C.T.RAVIKUMAR
                                                    Judge

                      P. BHAVADASAN, J.
                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
          Dated this the 12th day of October, 2012.

                                 ORDER



         B.A. No.5982 of 2012 is filed by the husband of

the defacto complainant, while B.A. 5708 of 2012 is by the

parents of the petitioner in B.A. 5982 of 2012. In both

these   applications,       the       respective            petitioners seek

anticipatory bail.

         2.       The        marriage            between        the   defacto

complainant and the petitioner in B.A. 5982 of 2012 took

place on 2.2.2006. The defacto complainant is a B.Tech.

Degree holder, while her husband is an M.Tech. Degree

holder from I.I.T. Madras.               The main allegation in the

complaint which was filed                before the JFCM Court and

which was forwarded for investigation under Section 156

(3) Cr.P.C. is that the defacto complainant was being

continuously harassed and humiliated                        demanding more

and more dowry. The allegation appears to be that at the

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                               2

time of fixation of marriage, the in-laws of the defacto

complainant represented as if they were unconcerned

anything that was to be given to the defacto complainant.

But, after the marriage fixation ceremony was over, it is

alleged that they had shown their true colour when they

insisted that it be let known to them what was intended to

be given to the defacto complainant at the time of marriage.

This annoyed the defacto complainant and her family and

they decided to call off the marriage.      Coming to know

about the same, it is stated that the petitioners apologized

for the misunderstanding caused and asserted that they

were totally unconcerned about what was being given to the

defacto complainant at the time of marriage.

            3. After the marriage was over, on the very same

day of marriage itself, it is alleged that the in-laws wanted

the defacto complainant to hand over all her gold

ornaments to them. There are allegations of usual nature of

continuous harassment, ill-treatment and humiliation and

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                              3

ultimately the defacto complainant being deprived of her

ornaments. It is alleged in the petition that the husband of

the defacto complainant has worked in several countries.

At the time when the couple was in Sharja, both were

employed in the same company and the allegation is that

when she used to get encomium for her work, it could not

be tolerated by her husband which resulted in physical

ill-treatment of the defacto complainant. It is also alleged

that her salary was being drawn by her husband, who used

to hand it over to his parents and she was left with no

savings. Then there is a long narration of various acts and

cruelty committed by the in-laws and her husband including

physical assault. The trauma at the time when she

conceived, and at the time of her delivery and thereafter are

also narrated in detail in the complaint filed before the

JFCM Court which in fact runs to several pages.

            4.    Based on the allegations in the complaint,

Crime No.1080 of 2012 was registered in Punalur Police

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                               4

Station for having committed offences punishable under

Sections 120B, 307, 323, 324, 327, 330, 329, 343, 346, 352,

354, 406, 498A read with Section 34 I.P.C.

            5. Petitioners in these petitions would deny the

allegations contained in the complaint and would accuse the

defacto complainant as a spoiled child of her parents.

According to the petitioners, she used to get agitated on

slightest pretext and it became extremely difficult to carry

on life with her. According to the petitioners, except for

some minor quarrel and squabbles, there was not much of

difference of opinion between the couple. The trouble in

fact started when the parents and other relatives of the

defacto complainant began to meddle with the family life of

the couple. Unnecessary and uncalled for interference by

the members of the family of the defacto complainant in the

marital life of the couple caused further trouble in their

marital life and their relationship went from bad to worse.

According to the petitioners, the allegations of ill-treatment,

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                                 5

humiliation, physical assault are only made for the purpose

of the petition       are not true. They apprehend arrest in

Crime No.1080 of 2012 and therefore they seek anticipatory

bail.

            6. Two highly educated persons entered into a

marital life.        One would have expected them to be

understandable and tolerant.        But it turned out to be

otherwise. One fact is very clear that the marital life is

irretrievably damaged and a reunion looks virtually

impossible. Though the matter was sent mediation, it did

not meet with success.

            7. The allegations in the complaint are indeed

very grave and serious. But as noticed by the Apex Court

in the decision reported in        Preeti Gupta v. State of

Jharkhand ((2010) 7 SCC 667), it is difficult in such cases

of harassment to ascertain the veracity of the allegations

and counter allegations. In fact, the Apex Court observed

as follows:

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                                 6

            "35. The ultimate object of justice is to find

      out the truth and punish the guilty and protect

      the innocent. To find out the truth is a Herculean

      task in majority of these complaints. The tendency

      of implicating husband and all his immediate

      relations is also not uncommon. At times, even

      after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult

      to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be

      extremely careful and cautious in dealing with

      these complaints and must take pragmatic

      realities into consideration while dealing with

      matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment

      of husband's close relations who had been living

      in different cities and never visited or rarely

      visited the place where the complainant resided

      would have an entirely different complexion. The

      allegations of the complaint are required to be

      scrutinized with great care and circumspection.

            36.       Experience reveals that long and

      protracted       criminal trials lead  to    rancour,

      acrimony and bitterness in the relationship

      amongst the parties. It is also a matter of common

      knowledge that in cases filed by the complainant

      if the husband or the husband's relations had to

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                               7

      remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin

      the chances of amicable settlement altogether.

      The process of suffering is extremely long and

      painful."

            8.    Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

defacto complainant, who got herself impleaded in these

proceedings very vehemently contended that the life with

her husband is inconceivable and he is using her as a

'punching bag'. Learned Senior Counsel emphasized that

the physical assaults were so severe and cruel, that it was

virtually impossible to continue life with her husband. In

fact, according to the learned counsel, the defacto

complainant had to undergo treatment for the various

injuries suffered by her at the hands of her husband and

things got so worse that she even        developed mental

problems. In such circumstances, the petitioners do not

deserve any sympathy at all.

            9. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

pointed out that as has been observed by the Apex Court in

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                                 8

the decision referred to above, all sorts of allegations are

seen made against her husband and his parents. May be,

according to the learned counsel, there were petty quarrels

and differences of opinion between the couple.          But he

denied that there was any physical assault or such cruel

acts which caused injuries to the defacto complainant.

Even now, according to the learned counsel for the

petitioners, the family of the husband of the defacto

complainant is willing to accept the complainant, provided

she is willing to lead a normal life.

            10. It is virtually impossible at this point of time

to ascertain wherein lies the truth. Both raise allegations

and counter allegations against each other. Of course, if

the allegations in the complaint are true, it is indeed cruel

and inhuman. But the question is are they true? In the CD

produced for perusal of this court, the photographs of the

lady at the time of marriage wearing tonnes of gold

ornaments and also the photographs of the bruises on the

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                                9

body of the        defacto complainant are seen. As regards

what had actually transpired, there are two versions given

by the defacto complainant and the family members of her

husband.       Even after going through the CD, it is not

possible at this point of time to come to the conclusion as to

who is at fault.

            11. It is significant to notice that the mediation

did not succeed, that means that the couple is not willing

for a reunion and a patch up is virtually out of question.

            12. Then the question is whether anticipatory bail

should be granted to the petitioners. As already noticed,

the allegations are indeed serious and the offences

attributed to the petitioners are indeed grave. Normally,

this court is extremely reluctant in cases of allegations of

such     offences to grant anticipatory bail to the accused

persons. But one has to remember in this case that the

court is dealing with the family life of two persons. At any

rate, even though the mediation has failed, the court can

B.A. Nos.5708 & 5982/2012.
                               10

still hope that wisdom may dawn on the parties and it may

be that after some time possibility of reunion need not be

ruled out. If as a matter of fact the petitioners are send to

jail and are remanded to custody by the court concerned,

that would only worsen the relationship and increase the

spite in the mind of the petitioners. The situation would

then be irretrievably lost.    On the other hand, possible

avoidance of incarceration may induce some wisdom on

both parties, so that they may, though late, try to patch up

the differences and continue the marital relationship

between the defacto complainant and the first petitioner.

            13. Taking the totality of the circumstances into

consideration, the facts and circumstances of the case, and

the possibility of a reunion, even though it looks difficult at

this point of time, induces this court to grant relief to the

petitioners.

            These applications are allowed as follows:

      shall produce them before the JFCM court

      concerned, which court, on applications for bail

      being moved by the petitioners, shall release them

      on bail on each of them executing a bond for a

      sum      of    Rs.25,000/-  (Rupees   Twenty   Five

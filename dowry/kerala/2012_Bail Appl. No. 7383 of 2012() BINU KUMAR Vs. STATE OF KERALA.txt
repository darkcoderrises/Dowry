                         BA No.7383 of 2012
             ----------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 14th day of November 2012

                                   Order


            This is an application filed under Section 439 of

Cr.PC., by the accused in Crime No.1191/12 of Parassala

Police Station, for having committed the offence punishable

under Section 304(B) of IPC.             The prosecution allegation is

that the wife of the petitioner committed suicide due to the

harassment meted out by him, demanding more dowry. The

learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he is totally

innocent and has been implicated with ulterior motives.             The

petitioner was arrested on 21.09.2012 and since then, he has

been in judicial custody. Therefore, according to the learned

counsel, a good part of the investigation must have been

completed and the continued custody of the petitioner is

unnecessary. So, he prays for grant of bail.

            2. The learned Public Prosecutor very vehemently

opposed the application and pointed out that the investigation

is only at an infant stage and if bail is granted, it will impede the

BA 7383/12                          2

investigation. He, therefore, prays that bail may not be granted

to the petitioner.

             3. After having heard the learned counsel on both

sides and gone through the records made available before this

court, the claim of the petitioner that he is totally innocent and

has been implicated with ulterior motives, does not appear to

be correct. But, the fact remains that he has been in custody

since 21.09.2012 and the investigation must have progressed

to a good extent. So, it is felt that the continued custody of the

petitioner is unnecessary. Moreover, there is no apprehension

raised by the prosecution that if released on bail, the petitioner

is likely to abscond.     In the facts and circumstances of the

case, it is felt that bail can be granted to the petitioner.

Accordingly, this application is allowed subject to the following

conditions :

1. The petitioner shall be released on bail, on executing a bond

   for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only) with

   two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction

   of the JFCM-II, Neyyattinkara.

2. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

BA 7383/12                           3

   sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts produced by the

   sureties, before granting bail to the petitioner.

3. The petitioner shall report before the Investigating Officer on

   every Monday between 9.30 am and 11.30 am, till final report

   is filed.

4. The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

5. If any of the conditions is violated, the bail granted shall

   stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned on being satisfied

   of the said fact, may take such action as available to him in

   law.

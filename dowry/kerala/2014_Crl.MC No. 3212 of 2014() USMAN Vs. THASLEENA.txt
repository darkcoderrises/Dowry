                  CRL.M.C No.3212 OF 2014
                  -----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                                ORDER

       Petitioners are accused in C.C.No.404 of 2013 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate -1, Perintalmanna.

The defacto complainant is the wife of the 1st petitioner. 2nd

and 3rd petitioners are his parents and the 4th the petitioner is

his brother. It is alleged that the petitioners subjected the

defacto complainant to cruelty demanding more dowry. It is

submitted that the matter has been settled and the

proceedings in the criminal case may be quashed.

      2.   The defacto complainant who is the 1st respondent

entered appearance through a counsel and filed an affidavit to

the effect that the matter has been settled and she has no

complaints against the respondents. I am satisfied that the

ground alleged in the petition is sufficient to quash the the

proceedings in the criminal case.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the

proceedings in C.C. No. 404 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate-1, Perintalmanna are quashed.

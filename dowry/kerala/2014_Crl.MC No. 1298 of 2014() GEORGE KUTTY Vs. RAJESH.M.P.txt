                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 17th day of March, 2014.

                                O R D E R



     This is an application filed by the accused persons in

C.C.No.637/2012 (Crime No.59/2011 of Pamba police Station)

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ranni

to quash the proceedings on the basis of a settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners were

shown as accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the above case. The case

was registered on the basis of a compliant given by the defacto

complainant alleging the offences under Sections 447, 506 (i)

and 332 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and on

that basis Crime No.59/2011 of                   Pamaba police station was

registered. After investigation, Annexure A1 final report was

filed which was taken on file as C.C.No.637/2012                        and it is

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ranni.

In the meantime, the matter has been settled between the

parties and since some of the offences are not compoundable

in nature, they could not file the application for compounding

Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014         2

before the concerned Magistrate court. So they have no other

option except to approach this    Court seeking the    following

relief:


         For these and other grounds to be urged at
         the time of hearing it is most respectfully
         submitted that this Hon'ble Court may be
         pleased to quash Annexure 1 proceedings
         Crime No.59/2011 of Pampa police station
         now pending as C.C.No.637/2012 on the file
         of JFMC, Ranni.



      3. Respondents 1 to 4, who are the defacto complainant

and the other persons involved in the incident appeared

through counsel and filed Annexures A2 series affidavits and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and they do not want to proceed with the prosecution in view of

the settlement. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that

there was some incident occurred between the parents of the

children studying in the school and the school staff on the basis

of which the present crime has been registered and later the

dispute between them     has been settled.  So he     prayed for

allowing the application.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014         3

directed by this Court submitted that except this case, there

is no other crime registered against the petitioners and

according to her instruction, the matter has been settled, but

opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a statement

given by the first respondent as the defacto complainant, the

Pamba police has registered a case as Crime No.59/2011

against the petitioners alleging the offences under Sections

447, 506(i) and 332 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code and after investigation, Annexure A1 final report was

field and it was taken on file as C.C.No.637/2012 and pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ranni.     It is

also an admitted fact that petitioners 1 and 2 are the parents

of children studying in the school and there was some incident

occurred on the fateful day in the school between the petitioners

and the school staff which resulted in registration of the crime.

It is seen from Annexure A2 series affidavits filed by the

defacto complainant and others, who were the injured       in the

case, that there was some incident occurred due to some

misunderstanding between the petitioners and the teachers of

Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014                4

the school and in that incident some scuffle occurred and now

the misunderstanding has been removed and harmony has been

restored between the parties and the school authorities on

account of intervention of mediators and others. Further, it

cannot be said to be an offence affecting the society as such

and the incident occurred in the school between the parents of

the children studying in the school and teachers which has

been settled amicably between them so as to restore harmony

between them and also have smooth functioning of the school

in future.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
             pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
             footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
             offences arising from commercial, financial mercantile,
             civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
             offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry,
             etc., or the family disputes where the wrong is
             basically private or personal in nature and the parties
             have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
             cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if
             in its view, because of the compromise between the
             offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
             remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case
             would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
             and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
             quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
             settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
             words, the High Court must consider whether it would

Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014                5

             be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
             continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation
             of the criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse
             of process of law despite settlement and compromise
             between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
             secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
             criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the
             above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
             shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the
             criminal proceeding."




      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and settlement was arrived at due to

intervention of respectable           mediators including the          Parent

Teachers Association and the staff of the school for the purpose

of restoring good relationship between the parents and the

school authorities and no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case as the prosecution witnesses are not going to

support the prosecution and it will be only wastage of time,

this Court feels that it is fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked

to  quash the proceedings.            So the petition is          allowed and

further proceedings in C.C.No.637/2012 (Crime No.59/2011 of

Pamba police station) pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Ranni against the petitioners is quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.1298 of 2014          6

      Office is directed to   communicate this order    to the

concerned court for further necessary action in this regard.

                  B.A.No.5413 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

     The petitioners are accused in Crime No.451/14 of

Chandera Police station and they preferred this petition

under section 438 of Cr.P.C. seeking anticipatory bail in

the above crime.

     2. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioners

harassed the de facto complainant both mentally and

physically, demanding dowry.        Thus they committed the

offences punishable under sections 323, 498A, 506(1) r/w

34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that no offence is attracted against the petitioners under

any of the offences incorporated in the above crime. The

                               2

learned Public Prosecutor has also stated that the above

crime is registered connected with a family dispute.

     5.  It appears to me that the first petitioner is the

husband of the de facto complainant and the 2nd petitioner

is her mother in law, who is aged 52. In the absence of any

specific overtact against the petitioners, according to me,

this petition can be allowed, particularly when the 2nd

petitioner is an aged woman.

     In the result, this petition is allowed and there will be

a direction that in the event of arrest of the petitioners,

they shall be released on bail, on each of them executing a

bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the

like amount to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer

in Crime No. 451/14 of Chandera Police station and on the

following other conditions :

          1.   The 1st petitioner shall report before the
          Investigating Officer in the above crime on every
          second Saturdays at 11 a.m.

                         3

      2.  The petitioners shall co-operate with the
      investigation and they shall not influence the
      witnesses or tamper the evidence.

                                         Judge.

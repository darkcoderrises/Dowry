               CRL.M.C. No.6851 of 2014
               ====================
           Dated this the 21st day of January, 2015

                         O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.725 of 2014 of the

Valapattanam Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-1 First Information

Report and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.1410

of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-II, Kannur, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

                             -: 2 :-



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.6851 of 2014
                                -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7. A copy of the agreement, by which the matter has

been settled between the parties has been produced as

Annexure-III. In Clause No.4 of Annexure-III, it has been

stated that the minor child of the 1st respondent and the 1st

petitioner is not entitled to claim any maintenance. The said

condition incorporated in the agreement is totally illegal.

The child is entitled to get maintenance. As the 1st

respondent is maintaining the child, she can claim

maintenance for the child till it's attaining the age of majority

and the 1st petitioner is duty bound to see that proper

maintenance is paid to the child. The said condition

restraining the maintenance to the child in Annexure-III is

illegal and is set aside.

      8. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

                               -: 4 :-



complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I

First Information Report and all further proceedings based

on it in C.C.1410 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur, are hereby quashed. It

is made clear that the child of the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent herein, shall be entitled to maintenance from the

1st petitioner.

                ===================
                 CRL.M.C. No.531 of 2015
                ====================
            Dated this the 4th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R


      Petitioners 1 to 5 are A1 to A5 in Crime No.119 of 2013

of the Pazhayangadi Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Section 498A read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code. 6th petitioner is the defacto

complainant.

      2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I Final Report in

Crime No.119 of 2013 of the Pazhayangadi Police Station as

against petitioners 1 to 5 and all further proceedings based

on it, in C.C.No.611 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court, Payyanur, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against petitioners 1 to 5 is that

CRL.M.C.No.531 of 2015
                               -: 2 :-



they have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant,

who is the 6th petitioner herein, who is the wife of the 1st

petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to petitioners 1 to 5, all the matters in

dispute between petitioners 1 to 5 and the defacto

complainant have been amicably settled and presently the

defacto complainant has no complaints against petitioners 1

to 5 and, therefore, the proceedings against petitioners 1 to

5 may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 6th petitioner

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and petitioners 1 to 5 have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against petitioners 1 to 5, and, hence, all further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

CRL.M.C.No.531 of 2015
                                   -: 3 :-



quashed. The learned counsel also endorses the fact that

the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto complainant

on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against petitioners 1 to 5, it is only just

and expedient in the interest of justice to quash the

proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I

Final Report in Crime No.119 of 2013 of the Pazhayangadi

Police Station as against petitioners 1 to 5 and all further

proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.611 of 2013 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Payyanur,

are hereby quashed.

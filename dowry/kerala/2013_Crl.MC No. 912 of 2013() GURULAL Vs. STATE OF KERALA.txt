                  Crl.M.C.No. 912 of 2013
               ----------------------------------
              Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                            ORDER

        The 4th accused in Crime No.679/2007 of Kollam East

Police Station, is the petitioner herein and he seeks an order

under Section 482 of Cr.P.C quashing all the proceedings

pending against him in C.C.No.97/12 of the Chief Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kollam, on the ground that the other

accused who faced trial in C.C.No.242/2007 connected with the

very same crime acquitted as per Annexure A1 judgment.

        2.        The above crime registered on the allegation

that the first accused had married PW2 one Rekha according to

customary rites and before the marriage A1 to 4 demanded

gold ornaments weighing 150 sovereigns and cash worth Rs.5

lakhs and on 14/5/2006 cash worth Rs. 2 lakhs was entrusted

with the accused and at the time of marriage gold ornaments

weighing 100 sovereign were also given to CW1, the said

Rekha. The allegation continues that further on 18/5/2006

Rs.50,000/- was given to the 1st accused as pocket money.

After marriage, the first accused and the said Rakhi who is

cited as CW1 were living as husband and wife at the house of

A1 and at Dubai where CW2 was working. It is the further case

Crl.M.C.No. 912 of 2013
                                  2

that while so, accused 2 to 4 demanded more dowry for

purchasing a service bus for the first accused. First accused

manhandled his wife for fulfilling the illegal demand. It is also

alleged that on 1/5/2007, A1 to A3 manhandled the wife of A1

for more dowry. According to the prosecution the accused was

acting in prosecution of their common intention. The wife of A1

gave a complain before the police and accordingly the above

crime was registered and on completing the investigation

report was filed. The petitioner was not available to face the

trial in C.C.No.242/2007 and therefore, the case against him

was split up and refiled as C.C.No.97/2012. The other accused

faced the trial but the result of the prosecution was not fruitful

and accordingly, all the other accused were acquitted. It is on

the basis of the above judgment the petitioner now

approached this court stating that even if the trial against him

as proceeded there would not have been fruitful turn out.

          3.          Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

          4.          Counsel appearing for the petitioner after

inviting my attention to Paragraph 8 of Annexure A1 judgment

submitted that even though the main allegation against the

Crl.M.C.No. 912 of 2013
                                  3

other accused, they are acquitted as there is no evidence. The

learned Public Prosecutor submitted that in the Anneure A1

judgment the main discussion and consideration of the court is

with respect to the incident taken place on 1/7/2007. But the

petitioner was not available during the trial of the said case

and therefore this petition has no merit at all.

          5.          I have carefully considered the submissions

made by the counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned

public prosecutor.

          6.          From the discussion and finding of the court

below, in A1 judgment it can be seen that the learned

Magistrate on the basis evidence or DW1 compelled with D1

and X1 found as proved that on the date of the alleged

incident the victim was admitted in Sree Narayana Trust

Medical Mission Hospital, Kollam, that too for mental disorder.

It is further held that though the witness have got a case that

PW2 have swelling on her cheek it is not supported by any

medical evidence. The learned Magistrate further find that

Ext.D3 shows that the PW2 was admitted in the hospital for

Bipolar Affective Disorder. Suffice to say, as per findings of the

court below no independent witness is examined by the

Crl.M.C.No. 912 of 2013
                                  4

prosecutor. Out of the witnesses examined PW2 is the victim

and her parent PW3 and PW4 were in Dubai and they reached

in the hospital only after getting information with regard to the

admission of the victim. The Learned Magistrate has also found

that there is substantial delay in taking legal steps though the

alleged offence was committed on 1/5/2007 and the said delay

is not properly explained. The first accused has filed a

complaint before the Kollam East Police Station alleging that

suppressing the illness of PW2 the wife of A1, the marriage

was solemnised. Further from the cross examination PW3 it is

clear that PW2 filed a case in the Family Court on 3/7/2006 as

O.S.No.25/2007 after filing Divorce O.P. by the first accused

before the Family Court. So on the basis of the above facts the

trial court found that complaint in the present case was filed

before the counter balst to harass the accused. It is on the

basis of the above finding the trial court acquitted all the

accused who faced the trial. That being the position, especially

when there no specific averments and allegation against the

petitioner no purpose would be severed in sending the

petitioner to face prosecution. Therefore, according to me the

petitioner is entitled to get the relief as prayer for.

                                 5

          In the result, this M.C is allowed quashing all the

proceedings pending against him in C.C.No.97/2012 in the

Court of Chief Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kollam.

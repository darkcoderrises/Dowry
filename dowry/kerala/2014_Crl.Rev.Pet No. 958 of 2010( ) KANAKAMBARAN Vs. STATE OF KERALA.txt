                                ORDER

     This Criminal Revision Petition is filed by the accused in

C.C. No.503 of 2006 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II, Thiruvananthapuram.                         The offence

alleged against the accused is under Section 377 of the Indian

Penal Code (for short 'the IPC'). The prosecution case is that on

6.8.2004 the accused committed unnatural offence against

PW2, who was a boy studying in the X standard. The trial

court convicted the accused under Section 377 of the IPC and

he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a

period of three years and also to pay a fine of `10,000/- in

default to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The

amount of fine, if recovered, was ordered to be given to

PW2/victim as compensation.                Against that conviction and

Crl.R.P. No.958 of 2010
                                  :2:

    sentence, the accused filed Criminal Appeal No.992 of 2008

    before the Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram, which was

    dismissed.      Against that judgment, the accused filed this

    Criminal Revision Petition.

          2.    During the pendency of this Criminal Revision

    Petition, the revision petitioner /accused and PW2/victim, who

    is now aged 21 years filed Crl.M.Application No.2165 of 2014

    under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash

    the conviction and sentence against the revision petitioner.

    PW2 filed an affidavit stating that at the instance of well

    wishers and mediators, the matter has been compromised and

    settled and that he has no surviving grievance against the

    revision petitioner. It is also stated in the affidavit that the

    dispute between them is strictly private and personal and no

    public policy as such is involved in the same.

          3. In the decision reported in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State

Crl.R.P. No.958 of 2010
                                       :3:

    of Punjab ([2008(3) KLT 19 (Supreme Court)], it was held :

                     "Criminal       proceedings       involving       non-

               compoundable offences can be quashed by accepting the

               terms of compromise reached between the rival parties, if

               the question involved in such disputes is purely of a

               personal nature."


         4. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

  [2012 (4) KLT 108 (Supreme Court)], it was held thus :


              "57. The power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

       proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

       jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

       criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

       Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

       limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

       engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the ends of justice or

       (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases

       power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R

       may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled

       their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of

       each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before

       exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to

       the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

Crl.R.P. No.958 of 2010
                                       :4:

      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim

      or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.

      Such offences are not private in nature and have serious impact

      on society. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like

      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to

      dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

      private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

      entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash

      criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

      remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

      accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

      despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the

      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it

      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue

      with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

      despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

      appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

Crl.R.P. No.958 of 2010
                                    :5:

      to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

      be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

      proceeding."



         5. Since the matter is amicably settled between the parties,

   I am of the view that in order to secure the ends of justice, the

   conviction and sentence against the revision petitioner has to be

   quashed by allowing Crl.M.Application No.2165 of 2014.

   Hence Crl.M. Application No.2165 of 2014 is allowed.

         Accordingly this Criminal Revision Petition is allowed.

   The conviction and sentence of the accused in C.C. No.503 of

   2006 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II,

   Thiruvananthapuram under Section 377 of the IPC is quashed

   and he is acquitted and set at liberty.

                  Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013


                           O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.5, 6 and 7 in Crime

No.428/11 of Kattoor police station, wherein the offences

alleged against the accused are under sections 420 and 34

of IPC along with sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Prize Chits

and Money Circulation (Banning) Act, 1978, with a prayer to

to quash all proceedings pending against them on the basis

of Annexure A FIR and all further proceedings in the above

crime, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                              :-2-:

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.         Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         4. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received           from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against

them.

         5. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor

on instruction submitted that the preliminary investigation

reveals that the 1st petitioner herein, who is the 5th accused,

has collected more than `1 lakh, as part of 'Money chain

business'.      Therefore, the settlement may not be at the

interest of the society at large. According to me, in the light

of the submissions made by learned Public Prosecutor and

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                              :-3-:

considering the seriousness of the allegation contained in

the crime, it is not just and proper to allow the 1st petitioner

to settle the matter or dropping the proceedings against

him, and hence he has to face the prosecution.

         6. Whereas the case of the petitioner nos.2 and 3,

who are accused nos.6 and 7 in the above crime, is that

there is no specific allegation against them and the 2nd

respondent-de facto complainant has no objection in

dropping the proceedings against them.               Therefore,

according to me, it is only just and proper to dispose the

M.C. recording the settlement arrived between the de facto

complainant and petitioner nos.2 and 3, who are accused

nos.6 and 7.

         7. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                             :-4-:

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition, in favour of 2nd and 3rd

petitioners only.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under sections 420 and 34 of IPC

along with sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Prize Chits and

Money Circulation (Banning) Act, 1978, which are more or

less personal in nature that too between the petitioner nos.2

and 3 and the de facto complainant, and no public interest is

involved, as far as they are concerned. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.      From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                                   :-5-:

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:             the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power    given   to   a  criminal     court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute
         would depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But    the    criminal    cases      having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,        financial,   mercandile,        civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                                 :-6-:

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According

to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process

of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.737 of 2013
                             :-7-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

proceedings pending against 2nd and 3rd petitioners alone, on

the basis of Annexure A FIR and all further proceedings in

Crime No.428/11 of Kattoor Police Station, against accused

nos.6 and 7.

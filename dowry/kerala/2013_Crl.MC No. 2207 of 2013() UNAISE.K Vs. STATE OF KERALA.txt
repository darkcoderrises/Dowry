                  Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013

                               ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in S.C.No.308 of

2012 on the file of the District & Sessions Court, Thalassery

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.542 of 2011 of Payangadi Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341 and 323 read with Section 34

of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the proceedings in Annexure-

A1 Final Report in Crime No.542 of 2011 of Payangadi Police

Station, Kannur, and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioners in S.C.No.308 of 2012 on the file of the District

and Sessions Court, Thalassery as the matter is settled out of

court.

     2.   The allegation of the prosecution against the

accused/petitioners is that, on 22/10/2011 they manhandled

the second respondent by beating on face and twisted the

Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
                              :-2-:


hand   due   to    previous  enmity   and   committed   offence

punishable under Sections 341 & 323 read with Section 34 of

IPC. The second respondent is the de facto complainant and

the 3rd respondent is his mother. Affidavits of respondents 2

and 3 are filed which are Annexures A3 and A4 respectively.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as respondents 2 and 3. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for respondents 2 and 3 who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the 2nd respondent, who is the de facto

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance against

them.

Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
                             :-3-:


        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-A3 and A4 affidavits.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341 and 323 read

with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for respondents 2 and 3, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
                                  :-5-:


        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2207 of 2013
                             :-6-:


        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 Final Report in Crime No.542 of 2011 of

Payangadi Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.308 of 2012 on the file of the

District and Sessions Court, Thalassery.

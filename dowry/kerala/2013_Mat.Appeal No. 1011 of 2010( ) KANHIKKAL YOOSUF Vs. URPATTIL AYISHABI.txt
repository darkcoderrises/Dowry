                  & Cross Objection 42 of 2013

               Dated this the 18th day of July, 2013

                              JUDGMENT

Antony Dominic, J.


1.This appeal and the cross objection arise from the judgment of

  the Family Court, Malappuram in O.P.No.782/09. That OP was

  filed by the wife, who is the respondent in the appeal, against

  her husband and his mother who are the appellants therein. In

  the OP, she sought a decree for return of 20 sovereigns of gold

  or its value and Rs.1,50,000/- paid to the first appellant at the

  time of marriage. By order dated 8.6.2010, the Family Court

  decreed the OP and directed the first appellant to return the

  value of 19 < sovereigns of gold or its value amounting to

  Rs.2,21,760/- and the second appellant was directed to return

  the value of > sovereigns of gold amounting to Rs.8,640/-.

  Interest at the rate of 9% was also awarded. The claim of the

  wife for recovery of Rs.1,50,000/- was rejected. Aggrieved by

  the direction requiring appellants 1 and 2 to return the value

  of 19 < and > sovereigns of gold respectively, Mat.A.1011/10

MA.1011/10 & CO.42/13
                                 2




  is filed by them. Similarly, aggrieved by the order of the

  Family Court rejecting her claim for recovery of Rs.1,50,000/-,

  the wife has filed cross objection 42/13.


2.We heard the counsel for the parties.


3.According to the counsel of the husband and mother, the

  appellants in MA.1011/10, the Family Court upheld the claim

  of the respondent for return of the value of the gold without

  any evidence whatsoever. The counsel, therefore, contended

  that the Family Court should have dismissed the OP filed by

  the wife.       On the other hand, the counsel for the wife

  submitted that apart from the oral evidence that was available,

  the wife had produced Exts.A1 and A2 before the Family Court

  which showed that her brother had purchased gold ornaments,

  out of which, 17 sovereigns were given to her at the time of

  marriage. According to him, there was evidence proving that

  in addition, she was given a mahar chain of 3 sovereigns.

MA.1011/10 & CO.42/13
                                  3




4.Having considered the respective submissions made by the

  learned counsel for the parties, we are inclined to think that

  the conclusion of the Family Court, on the evidence available

  before it, does not call for any interference.



5.As far as the gold ornaments are concerned, Exts.A1 and A2

  were the documents produced by the respondent wife. Ext.A1

  though described in the impugned order as a bill, is only an

  estimate issued by a jeweller which contains the details of the

  ornaments purchased and the payments that were made.

  Ext.A2 is the wedding photograph which also shows that the

  bride was wearing various ornaments.          The nature of the

  ornaments worn by the wife, as disclosed from the photograph,

  are more or less similar to the description of the ornaments

  contained in Ext.A1. Added to this is the evidence of PW1, the

  wife and PW2, her brother.      PW1 deposed fully in support of

  her case and PW2, her brother, also deposed about the

  purchase of gold ornaments. Therefore, the findings of the

  Family Court that the wife was given 17 sovereigns of gold at

MA.1011/10 & CO.42/13
                                4




  the time of marriage and that she had a mahar chain of 3

  sovereigns do not suffer from any illegality.



6.In so far as the question of entrustment and misappropriation

  is concerned, the Family Court took the view that at the time

  of marriage, the wife was a teenager and going by the normal

  human conduct, when she reaches a strange and new

  atmosphere of the matrimonial house, she would have

  certainly entrusted the gold ornaments to the appellants.

  Once it is found that there was such an entrustment, the

  appellants had the responsibility to return the ornaments and

  it was for them to have proved that fact. Admittedly, they did

  not have a case that the gold ornaments were so returned. It

  was on this basis that the Family Court found that there was

  entrustment and misappropriation. This finding of the Family

  Court is consistent with the normal human conduct and

  evidence available in the case and therefore, cannot be said to

  be an illegal one.

MA.1011/10 & CO.42/13
                                5




7.The evidence before the Family Court also suggested that

  within one week of the marriage, the husband was entrusted

  with 16 < sovereigns of gold and the mother-in-law had taken

  > sovereigns of gold within one month. It is also in evidence

  that when the husband's demand for a further amount as

  dowry was denied by the wife, he snatched away the mahar

  chain of 3 sovereigns.    It was relying on these pieces of

  evidence that the Family Court held the first appellant liable to

  return 19 < sovereigns of gold and the second appellant, >

  sovereigns of gold. On an overall consideration of the case in

  the light of the evidence, we are not persuaded to think that

  this view taken by the Family Court warrants any interference.



8.In so far as cross objection 42/13 filed by the wife is

  concerned, she is aggrieved by the denial of her claim of

  return of Rs.1,50,000/-. Apart from the oral assertion made,

  there is no evidence whatsoever to sustain this claim. In such

  circumstances, we are not persuaded to think that the view

  taken by the Family Court justifies interference.

 In the result, appeal and the cross objection will stand

 dismissed.

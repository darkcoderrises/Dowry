                Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 30th day of September, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in

C.C.No.293 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Mavelikkara, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No.891 of 2013 of Nooranadu

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Sections

452, 294(b), 323, 324, 506(1) r/w section 34 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to set aside Annexure A1 FIR and A2 final report, as

the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

11.7.2013 at 5.30 p.m., due to an enmity on account of not

paying the interest of one month for the amount of

Rs.15,000/- borrowed by de facto complainant's husband

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                               2

Ravindran Nair, the accused persons in furtherance of

their common intention to physically assault and to

threaten, causing fear of life, criminally trespassed into the

residence, wherein the de facto complainant residing with

the family and insulted them by abusing filthy language

and beaten on the face of the de facto complainant's

husband and beaten the de facto complainant with the

wood kept in their possession and kicked her on her

abdomen and leg, and further threatened their children

and thereby committed the offences as alleged by the

prosecution. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                                3

dispute, which is the subject matter of the above case, as

per Annexure A3 sworn into by the 2nd respondent and

Annexure A4 sworn into by the 3rd respondent. Therefore,

the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5.     The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents, submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainant and CW2

respectively, do not intends to proceed any further against

the petitioners and they have no grievance against the

petitioners.

         6.       I   have carefully considered the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                             4

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 452,

294(b), 323, 324, 506(1) r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.

It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant and CW2 have no further grievance against

the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                                    5

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly       and   pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                                6

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.           Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, setting aside

Annexure A1 FIR and A2 final report in Crime No. 891 of

Crl.M.C.No.5536 of 2014
                              7

2013 of Nooranadu Police Station and all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.293

of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Mavelikkara.

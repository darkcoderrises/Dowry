                Crl.M.C.No.3463 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

     The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.594/14

of Museum Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, and he

approached this Court under section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a

prayer to quash all proceedings pending against him in the

above crime, as the matter is settled with the de facto

complainant and the injured.

     2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 and 3 and

also the learned Public Prosecutor.

     3.   The prosecution case is that on 15.4.2014 at 4

p.m., the accused trespassed into the house of the de facto

complainant and attacked them and used obscene words

and thus the accused committed the offences punishable

under sections 294(b), 323, 354 and 452 IPC.

Crl.M.C.No.3463 of 2014
                             2

      4.    The aggrieved persons in the present case are

respondent nos.2 and 3, among which, the 2nd respondent

is the de facto complainant.      As per the prosecution

allegation, the alleged incident was occurred in the house

of the de facto complainant and no public interest is

involved in this case. As the aggrieved person, including

the de facto complainant, are the injured, have no further

grievance, according to me, the proceedings pending

against the petitioner can be quashed.           By filing

Annexures- B and C affidavits, respectively of respondents

2 and 3, it is submitted that they do not want to proceed

with the present case.         In the above facts and

circumstances involved in the case, under the changed

versions of the de facto complainant and the injured, even

if the trial is allowed to proceed, there will not be any

fruitful prosecution, rather the same is likely to end in

sheer waste of judicial time. Therefore, according to me,

this petition can be allowed, following the decision

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

Crl.M.C.No.3463 of 2014
                                    3

108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But   the    criminal   cases     having
          overwhelmingly     and    pre-dominatingly      civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
          arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
          civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature
          and the parties have resolved their entire
          dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because of the compromise between the offender
          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
          and bleak and continuation of criminal case
          would put accused to great oppression and
          prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
          full and complete settlement and compromise
          with the victim........"

      In the result, this M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure-

A FIR in Crime No.594/14 of Museum Police Station,

Thiruvananthapuram, and all further proceedings thereto

pending against the petitioner.

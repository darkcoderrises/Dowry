                ========================
                    Crl.M.C. No.2 of 2015
               =========================
            Dated this the 15th day of January, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.315 of 2012 of the

Chadayamangalam        Police    Station  registered  for  the

offences punishable under Section 498A read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure A2 final report and

all further proceedings based on it in C.C.676 of 2014

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Kadakkal, quashed. After completion of the investigation, the

police filed final report before the      Judicial First Class

CRL.M.C.No.2 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



Magistrate's Court-II, Kottarakkara. The learned Magistrate

has taken cognizance and numbered the case as

C.C.No.546 of 2012. While so, when the new court has

been established at Kadakkal, the case has been

transferred to the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Kadakkal and the case is renumbered as C.C.No.676 of

2014

      3.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

CRL.M.C.No.2 of 2015
                              -: 3 :-



complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.     The    defacto complainant,   who    is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

CRL.M.C.No.2 of 2015
                                  -: 4 :-



      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A2

final report and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.676 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Kadakkal are hereby quashed.

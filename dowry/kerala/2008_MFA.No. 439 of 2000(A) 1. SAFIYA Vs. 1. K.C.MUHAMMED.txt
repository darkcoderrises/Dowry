            ----------------------------------------------------------------
                     Dated this the 29th day of July, 2008

                                   JUDGMENT


Harun-Ul-Rashid, J.

       The petitioner in O.P. No.613 of 1998 on the file of the Family

Court, Kozhikode is the appellant. She filed the said Original Petition for

return of gold ornaments and money. The Family Court by order dated

4.12.1999 dismissed the Original Petition finding that there is no

convincing or reliable evidence in support of her case. Hence, this appeal.

The parties herein are referred to as petitioner and respondent as in the

Original Petition.



       2.   The marriage between the petitioner and respondent was

solemnised on 22.1.1984. It is the case of the petitioner that at the time of

marriage, she was given 25 sovereigns of gold ornaments and an amount

of Rs.25,000/- and that within one month of the marriage, the

respondent/husband misappropriated the entire gold ornaments and money.

It is her further case that subsequently she was driven out of the house on

24.10.1997 demanding more dowry. Hence, she filed the Original Petition

M.F.A.NO.439/2000                     2




for return of Rs.25,000/-and the gold ornaments worth Rs.80,000/-.



       3. The respondent/husband opposed the petition and contended that

the petitioner was not given 25 sovereigns of gold ornaments and

Rs.25,000/- at the time of marriage as alleged and that the parents of the

petitioner had no capacity to      give the amount or so much of gold

ornaments.      He further contended that at the time of marriage, the

petitioner/wife had only 8 sovereigns of gold ornaments and she is in

possession of the same. He denied having received Rs.25,000/- and also

the allegation that the petitioner was driven out of the house. Before the

Family Court, the petitioner examined four witnesses including herself as

PW.1 and Exts.A1 to A3 were marked on her side. The respondent was

examined as RW.1. No documentary evidence was produced by him.



       4. The factum of marriage is admitted. It is also admitted by the

parties that they are living separately from the month of October, 1997.

PW.1 produced Ext. A1 slip to prove that she had the ornaments as stated

in the petition.   The Family Court observed that Ext.A1 by itself is

insufficient to prove the said fact.  The father of the petitioner who was

examined as PW.2 also tendered evidence regarding the purchase of gold

ornaments from the goldsmith. The goldsmith was examined as PW.3.

M.F.A.NO.439/2000                     3




The Family Court observed that there was inconsistency in the evidence

tendered by PWs.2 and 3 and that the petitioner was not in possession of

any bill showing the purchase of gold ornaments.



      5. It is common knowledge that people do not ask for bills even

from leading shops in order to avoid charges towards tax. The Family

Court ought not to have insisted on producing the bill to prove purchase of

gold ornaments and that too from a goldsmith. The finding that Ext.A1 is

a suspicious document is a finding entered on surmises. The learned

Family Court Judge was too technical in evaluating the evidence which

resulted in making observations against the petitioner and her witnesses.

PW.4 was also examined on the side of the petitioner to prove that the

respondent had sold the gold ornaments . The Family Court found fault in

not examining Koyammu to whom, according to PW.4, the gold ornaments

were sold. After evaluating the evidence, the Family Court held that there

is no evidence to prove that the respondent/husband had taken the gold

ornaments and the money as alleged in the Original Petition.



      6. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, we are

of the view that the evidence tendered by the petitioner and her witnesses

needs to be reappreciated and reevaluated for the purpose of arriving at a

M.F.A.NO.439/2000                    4




correct decision. As we have stated earlier, most of the reasons stated for

discarding the evidence adduced by the petitioner are technical and

negative in nature. The matter, therefore, requires reconsideration. It is

seen that in the Original Petition, the value of 25 sovereigns of gold

ornaments is shown as Rs.80,000/-. The appellant/petitioner is at liberty to

amend the Original Petition stating the present value of the gold

ornaments.



      In the result, the order under challenge is set aside and the case is

remanded to the Family Court, Kozhikode for fresh consideration. The

Family Court shall pass final orders within a period of six months from the

date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There will be no order as to

costs.

                ------------------------------------
                     B.A. No. 2286 of 2013
                 -----------------------------------
               Dated this the 4th day of June, 2013

                             O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2. Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.1562/2012 of

the Kundara Police Station, Kollam registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 IPC.

      3. The allegation against the petitioners is that, they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner and treated her with cruelty by

demanding more dowry.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor. The crime has been registered on

the basis of a private complaint filed by the defacto

complainant before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-

I, Kollam, which was referred to the Police under Section 156

(3) Cr.P.C. It seems that on the next day of the marriage, the

defacto complainant had gone to her house on the allegation

that the first petitioner is a mentally ill person. The learned

counsel for the petitioners has pointed out that the first

petitioner was in fact admitted at a Mental Health Centre and

B.A. No. 2286 of 2013              2




had undergone treatment as inpatient for more than one

month. Just after two weeks of her departure from the

matrimonial house, she filed OP before the Family Court for

getting the marriage declared as null and void. It is after more

than one year, the present private complaint was filed. On

going through the contents of the CD and hearing either side, I

am satisfied that the custodial interrogation of the petitioners

is not essential for the further investigation of this case.

Matters being so, this is a fit case in which anticipatory bail

can be granted to the petitioner.

      5.    In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners is directed to enlarge

the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest, on each of

them executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees Twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each

to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject

to the following terms and conditions:-

      (1)   The petitioners shall report before the Investigating

Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Tuesdays and

B.A. No. 2286 of 2013               3




Fridays commencing from 11-06-2013 for a period of three

months or till the filing of the final report, which ever is earlier.

      (2)   The petitioners shall not tamper with the evidence

or influence witnesses.

      (3)   The petitioners shall make themselves available for

interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

Officer.

      (4) The petitioners shall not involve in any offence while

on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.




                                         B. KEMAL PASHA,
                                               JUDGE

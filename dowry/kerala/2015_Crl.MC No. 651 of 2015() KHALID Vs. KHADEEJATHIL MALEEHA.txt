                   Crl.M.C. No. 651 of 2015
            =======================
           Dated this the 12th day of February, 2015


                           O R D E R



     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.62 of 2013 of the

Nallalam Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 323, 325, 427, 498A         and 506(ii) read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in

Crime No.62 of 2013 of the Nallalam Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1123 of 2013 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-V, Kozhikode,

quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

Crl.M.C. No. 651 of 2015
                                  2

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed. She has entered appearance

through her counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto

complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been

sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

Crl.M.C. No. 651 of 2015
                                3

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

Final Report in Crime No.62 of 2013 of the Nallalam Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1123 of

2013 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-

V, Kozhikode, are hereby quashed.

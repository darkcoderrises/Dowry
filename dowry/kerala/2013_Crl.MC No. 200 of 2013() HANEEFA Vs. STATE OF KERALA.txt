                   Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 19th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime No.1188

of 2012 of Karunagappally Police Station, which is a case

instituted upon a statement made by the 2nd respondent for the

offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 326, 506(2), 307

& 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-B F.I.R. in

Crime No.1188 of 2012 of Karunagappally Police Station and

all subsequent proceedings pursuant on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Karunagappally as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation against the petitioners is that, on

11/06/2012 at about 11 a.m. the petitioners/accused attacked

the de facto complainant with hands and also gave a blow with

a wooden piece causing injury on the foot of the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013

                              :-2-:


complainant. The reason for the attack is that the de facto

complainant saw the illegal connection between the first

accused and the 3rd accused. Now, the case of the petitioners

is that the dispute is settled out of court between them who

are close relatives.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd respondent.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties, which is the subject

matter of the above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who, on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant/victim/injured, does not intend to proceed any

Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013

                             :-3-:


further against the petitioners and she has no grievance

against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-C affidavit and Annexure-D Notarised affidavit of the

2nd respondent. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only      under Sections 323, 324, 326,

506(2), 307 & 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013

                                       :-4-:


for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013

                                   :-5-:


        for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

        arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

        partnership or such like transactions or the offences

        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled

the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

Crl.M.C.No.200 of 2013

                             :-6-:


the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-B F.I.R. in Crime No.1188 of 2012 of Karunagappally

Police Station and all subsequent proceedings against the

petitioners pursuant on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Karunagappally.

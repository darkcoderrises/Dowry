                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 31st day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


       This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by accused 1

to 4 in SC.No.340/2013 of Assistant Sessions Court, Hosdurg

to quash the proceedings on the basis of a settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners                     are

arrayed as accused 1 to 4 in Crime No.803/2010 of Bekal police

station which was registered on the basis of a statement given

by the defacto complainant/second respondent against the

petitioners and four identifiable persons alleging commission

of offences under sections 143, 148, 323, 324 and 308 read

with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation,

final report was filed and after committal, the case was taken

on file as    SC.No.340/2013 on                the file of           Sessions Court,

Kasaragod and      thereafter it was made over to the Assistant

Sessions Court, Hosdurg for disposal.

      3. Now the matter has been settled                      between the parties

and on account of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014                   2

proceeding with prosecution in this case and since some of the

offences alleged are not compoundable in nature, they could

not approach the court below for recording the settlement. So

the petitioners have no other remedy except to approach this

seeking the following relief:

                     On these and other grounds to be urged at the time

             of hearing it is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court

             may be pleased to quash Annexure-A2 final report and all

             further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.803/2010 of

             Bekal    police    station, which   is   now   pending    as

             S.C.No.340/2013 on the file of the       learned   Assistant

             Session's Court, Hosdurg as against the petitioners, so as to

             secure the ends of justice.

        4. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and on account of the settlement, their earlier relationship has

been restored and he does not want to prosecute the petitioners

in view of the settlement and he filed Annexure -A3 affidavit

stating these facts.

        5. Counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of the

settlement, no conviction is possible and keeping the case on

file only amount to wastage of judicial time and prayed for

allowing the application.

Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014             3

        6. The learned       Public Prosecutor, on instructions,  as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners, but opposed the application on the

ground that grave offences like Section 308 is incorporated.

        7. It is an admitted fact that in an incident happened on

20.11.2010, on the basis of the statement given by the second

respondent, a crime was registered as Crime No.803/2010 of

Bekal police station against the petitioners and other          four

identifiable persons alleging offences under Sections 143, 147,

148, 323, 324 and 308 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code and after investigation, Annexure A2 final report was filed

and after            committal, the matter was taken on file as

SC.No.340/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court, Kasaragod

which was later made over to Assistant Sessions Court, Hosdurg

for disposal.          During the pendency of that proceedings, the

matter has been settled between the parties due to intervention

of mediators and well wishers of both the parties and old

relationship between them has been restored. In view of the

settlement, neither the defacto complainant nor his witnesses

will likely to support the prosecution and        conviction in such

cases is remote and keeping the case on file will amount to

Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014                  4

wastage of judicial time. Further, it cannot be said to be a

matter of public interest, but only a private dispute which has

resulted in registering of the crime and filing of final report.

        8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite full and   complete    settlement   and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014                   5

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




        9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also on account of the settlement, there is no possibility of

any conviction and              allowing the case to proceed with will

amount to wastage of judicial time and also considering the

fact that the matter has been settled between the parties on

account of the settlement and the relationship between the

parties has been restored, this Court feels that this is a fit

case where the power under Section                      482 of the Code   of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

to promote the settlement.


            So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in SC.No.340/2013 (Crime No.803 of Bekal police station) on

Crl.M.C.No.2700 of 2014            6

the file of the Assistant Sessions      Court, Hosdurg is hereby

quashed.

        Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

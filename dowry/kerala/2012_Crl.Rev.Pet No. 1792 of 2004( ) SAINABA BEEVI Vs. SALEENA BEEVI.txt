              -------------------------------------------
                      Crl.R.P. No.1792 of 2004
             ----------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 11th day of December, 2012

                                ORDER

      The petitioner is the 2nd accused in C.C.No.97/1994 before

the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Pathanamthitta.              The

petitioner and the 1st accused were prosecuted for offences

punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition

Act. Since the 1st accused was absconding, the case was split up

and continued against the petitioner alone.              The Magistrate

convicted the petitioner and sentenced her as follows:

        "The accused is convicted and sentenced to pay a fine
        Rs.5000/- (Rs. five thousand only) in default to
        undergo simple imprisonment for six months.       The
        accused shall return Rs.1,00,000/- and 50 Grms. of
        gold within a period of two months from to-day and
        failing to comply such direction within the stipulated
        period specified above, the amount of Rs.1,00,000/-
        and the value of 50 Grms of gold estimated to
        Rs.25,000/- shall be recovered from A2 as if it were
        fine imposed by this court and shall be paid to the
        complainant as compensation."

The petitioner filed Criminal Appeal No.65/1997 before the

Additional    District  and    Sessions     Judge     (Adhoc)  Court-I,

Pathanamthitta.       The Sessions Judge dismissed the appeal,

confirming the conviction and the sentence.            The petitioner is

Crl. R.P.No.1792/04               2

challenging the judgments of the courts below.

       2.    The defacto complainant and the petitioner have

entered into a compromise settling the disputes between

them. Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.11029/2004 has

also been filed seeking permission to compound the offences.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that although

the offences are not compoundable, this Court may invoke the

principles     of   the  decision of  the   Supreme    Court   in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108(SC)] to

quash the proceedings against the petitioner under Section

482 of the Cr.P.C.

       3.    I have heard the parties.

       4.    As    is  clear from   the Criminal   Miscellaneous

Application No.11029/2004, the defacto complainant and the

petitioner have settled the matter between themselves and the

defacto complainant has no objection in acquitting the

petitioner in the light of the settlement arrived at out of court.

The Supreme Court has in Gian Singh's case (supra) held that

it is within the powers of a High Court to quash criminal

Crl. R.P.No.1792/04               3

proceedings, involving non-compoundable offences, on the

basis of compromise reached between the offender and the

victim, if it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice

to continue with such proceedings, in view of the settlement

and compromise reached. I am of opinion that this is a fit

case, where the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in

the Gian Singh's case (supra) can be applied. The petitioner is

a lady.      The defacto complainant and the petitioner have

settled the matter between themselves.             In the above

circumstances, I am satisfied that it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

proceedings against the petitioner, in view of of the settlement

and compromise reached.

       5.    Accordingly,  considering    the    settlement    and

compromise reached between the petitioner and the defacto

complainant, since I am of opinion that it would be unfair and

contrary to justice to continue the proceedings against the

petitioner, invoking powers of this Court under Section 482 of

the Cr.P.C., I quash the criminal proceedings against the

Crl. R.P.No.1792/04               4

petitioner, set aside the judgments of the courts below and

acquit the petitioner of the offences charged against her. Her

bail bond is cancelled. She is set at liberty.

       The Cr.R.P. is disposed of as above.

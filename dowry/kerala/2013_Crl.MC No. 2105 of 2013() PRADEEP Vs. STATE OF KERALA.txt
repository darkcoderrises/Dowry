                  Crl.M.C.No.2105 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of June, 2013

                            ORDER




     This is an application filed under Section 482 of the

Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-I charge sheet

and proceedings pending as against the petitioners in

C.C.No.5241/2010 of the Judicial First Class Margistrate

Court-II, Ernakulam.

     2.   First petitioner is the husband of the second

respondent, who is the de-facto complainant in Crime

No.568/2010 of Cheranalloor Police Station. The allegation

in the above crime is that the second respondent(de-facto

complainant) was subjected to cruelty at the matrimonial

home by her husband and relatives demanding dowry.

     3.   The police after conducting investigation filed a

report in the above crime and cognizance was taken and

accordingly, C.C.No.5241/2010 is instituted in the Judicial

Crl.M.C.No.2105 of 2013        2




First Class Magistrate Court-II,      Ernakulam.   Now the

prayer of the petitioners is that as the matter is settled

out of court, criminal proceedings pending against them

may be quashed.

      4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.       The     learned counsel   appearing for  the

respondents, who is the de-facto complainant submitted

that she does not want to proceed against the

petitioners/accused in the above criminal case as the

matter is settled out of court.         Annexure-AII is the

affidavit filed by the second respondent, in which, it is

stated that the dispute is settled between the parties and

she does not want to proceed with the case in

C.C.No.5241/2010.           I am satisfied with the reasons

stated in the affidavit and the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

Crl.M.C.No.2105 of 2013         3




respondents. In the present case, the offences involved

are under Sections 498A, 323 and 34 of the Indian Penal

Code. Since the matter is settled out of court between

the parties and especially when the issue is among the

spouse, according to me, in the light of the decision in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab & another(2012(4) KLT

198(SC) is attracted in the present case.

      In the result, following the dictum laid down in the

above decision,        this Crl.M.C. is disposed of, quashing

Annexure-AI charge sheet and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.5241/2010 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Ernakulam.

                                       V.K.MOHANAN, JUDGE.

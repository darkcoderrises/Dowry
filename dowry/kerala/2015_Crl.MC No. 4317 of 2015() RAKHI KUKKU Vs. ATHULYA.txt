         ============================
             Crl.M.C.Nos.4317 & 5872 of 2015
         ============================
            Dated this the 26th day of November, 2015


                            ORDER



     A prosecution involving the offence under Section 498A

IPC is sought to be quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It is

now pending as C.C.No.389 of 2015 before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Alappuzha.        The petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.5872 of 2015 are the accused Nos.1 to 3 in the

said case, and the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.4317 of 2015 is

the 4th accused.     The defacto complainant is the first

respondent in these two proceedings. The petitioners seek

orders on the ground that the complaint made by the first

respondent does not contain definite materials for a

prosecution under Section 498A IPC.

     2.   On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the

materials including the complaint, I find that the first

Crl.M.C.Nos.4317 & 5872 of 2015    2

respondent has a genuine case, and a genuine grievance to

be heard by the learned Magistrate, but as regards the other

accused the complaint does not contain definite materials

constituting cruelty as meant and defined under Section

498A IPC. A single instance of simple assault will not come

under Section 498A IPC. As regards the accused No.4, the

petitioners' grievance is that the 4th accused has some illicit

connection with her husband (first accused).        That the

husband has some connection with some other lady cannot

be the subject matter of a prosecution under Section 498A

IPC. As regards the accused Nos.2 and 3, the allegation is

that when the first respondent picked up a quarrel with her

husband questioning the connection with the 4th accused, the

accused Nos.2 and 3 assaulted her on an occasion. I find

that the complaint does not contain definite and acceptable

materials and allegations against the accused Nos.2 to 4.

This Court has noticed an unhealthy trend in Kerala, that

whenever a lady complains of illtreatment by her husband,

she would get some advise to arraign all the inmates of the

matrimonial home, or all the in-laws, as accused in the

complaint under Section 498A IPC. Here also I find such a

Crl.M.C.Nos.4317 & 5872 of 2015       3

situation.            Ofcourse, as against the husband, the first

respondent has a genuine grievance, and the complaint also

contains some materials and allegations of matrimonial

cruelty against him.

         3.        The cruelty meant and defined under Section 498A

IPC must be some act of physical or mental harassment in

connection with demand for dowry or otherwise, by a course

of cruel conduct. There is no such allegation here against the

accused Nos.2 to 4. But, as against the first accused such

allegations are there in the complaint. I find that if the

prosecution proceeds against the accused Nos.2 to 4, it will

be an abuse of legal process.             But as against the first

accused, it will have to continue before the learned

Magistrate.

         In the result, Crl.M.C.No.4317 of 2015 will stand allowed.

The prosecution against the petitioner therein as 4th accused

in C.C.No.389 of 2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Alappuzha will stand quashed under Section 482

Cr.P.C. Crl.M.C.No.5872 of 2015 will stand allowed only in

part. The prosecution against the petitioners 2 and 3 therein

as accused Nos. 2 and 3 in C.C.No.389 of 2015 in the court

Crl.M.C.Nos.4317 & 5872 of 2015            4

below will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. But, the

prosecution against the first accused will continue. Ofcourse,

he can make an application for discharge before the learned

Magistrate, if he so opts.

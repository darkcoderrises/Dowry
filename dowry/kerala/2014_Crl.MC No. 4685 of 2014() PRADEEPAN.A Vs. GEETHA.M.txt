                         Crl.M.C.No. 4685 of 2014
                     ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 19th day of August, 2014

                                  O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No. 701/2014 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur,             which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 372/2014 of Payyannur

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 341,323,

324,354,354A,294(b) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure I final report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.701/2014 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur in Crime

No.372/2014 of Payyannur Police Station          as the matter is settled out of

court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 5.4.2014 at 15.00

hrs. while the de facto complainant, her husband and son travelling in a

car to join a marriage function at Mukkam in Kozhikode, and when they

Crl.M.C.No.4685 of 2014


                                     :-2-:

reached at Kaivellur, the accused persons unlawfully restrained them and

abused in filthy language and attacked them etc. and thereby the accused

outraged the modesty and committed the offences punishable under

Sections 341,323, 324,354,354A,294(b) read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

respondents 1 and 2. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first and second respondents, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents, submitted that

the above respondents, who are the de facto complainants/injured do not intend

to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

Crl.M.C.No.4685 of 2014


                                    :-3-:

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

341,323, 324,354,354A,294(b) read with Section 34 of I.P.C.     which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.       From the

submission made by the counsel for respondents 1 and 2, it appears to me that

the   de  facto    complainants   have   no   further  grievance   against   the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.       In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.4685 of 2014


                                           :-4-:

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
           can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

Crl.M.C.No.4685 of 2014


                                      :-5-:

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure I final

report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.701/2014 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur in Crime No.372/2014 of Payyannur

Police Station.

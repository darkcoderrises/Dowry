              Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

            ...............................................

     Dated this the 19th day of November, 2013


                          JUDGMENT

A son and his mother were prosecuted for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A and 306 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for having

instigated the wife of the 1st accused namely Sheeba,

who is also the daughter-in-law of the mother, the 2nd

accused to commit suicide. They were found guilty on

both counts. The 1st accused was sentenced to undergo

rigorous imprisonment for 4 years and to pay a fine of

`10,000/- for the offence under Section 306 of IPC with a

default clause of 10 months and sentenced to undergo

rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of

`5,000/- with a default clause of rigorous imprisonment

for 5 months for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

The 2nd accused was sentenced to undergo rigorous

imprisonment for 7 years and to pay a fine of `10,000/-

with a default clause of rigorous imprisonment for 10

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                                 2



   months for the offence under Section 306 of IPC and

   rigorous imprisonment for 2 years with a fine of `5,000/-

   with a default clause of rigorous imprisonment for 5

   months for the offence under Section 498A of IPC. The

   substantive         sentences  were  directed    to   run

   concurrently. Set off as per law was allowed and it is

   also directed that if the fine amount was realised a sum

   of `25,000/- would be paid to P.W.2.




2.The marriage between the 1st accused and Sheeba, the

   victim, who is the sister of P.W.1 and the daughter of

   P.W.2 was conducted on 15.07.2001. The allegation is

   that    the accused       persons used  to ill-treat her

   complaining of her inadequate charm and also harassed

   her for other matters. They used to continuously ill-treat

   her and on one occasion, the 2nd accused is alleged to

   have beaten her with a wooden log. On 10.03.2003,

   Sheeba was found hanging.        Though removed to the

   hospital she succumbed. P.W.1, the brother laid Ext.P1

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               3



   First Information Statement. P.W.11, Sub Inspector of

   Police recorded Ext.P1 First Information Statement and

   registered crime as per Ext.P1(a) First Information

   Report. He took over initial investigation. He prepared

   Ext.P10 scene mahazar. The inquest was conducted by

   P.W7 and furnished Ext.P3 report.          Autopsy was

   conducted by P.W.9, who furnished Ext.P7 report.

   P.W.11 seized the articles found in the place of incident

   and had them sent for forensic examination. He filed a

   report incorporating Section 498A read with Section 34

   of IPC. The rest of the investigation was conducted by

   P.W.10 and finally laid charge before Court.




3.The court, before which, final report was laid took

   cognizance of the offences and finding that the offences

   are exclusively triable by a court of Sessions, the case

   was committed to Sessions Court, Kottayam. The said

   court made over the case to Additional Sessions Court,

   Adhoc-I, Kottayam for trial and disposal.     The latter

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               4



   court on receipt of records and on appearance of the

   accused framed charges for the offences punishable

   under Sections 306 and 498A read with Section 34 of

   IPC, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and

   claimed to be tried. The prosecution examined P.Ws.1

   to 14 and had Exts. P1 to P13 marked. M.Os.1 to 3 were

   got identified and marked.




4.After the close of prosecution evidence, the accused

   was questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C. They denied

   all the incriminating circumstances brought out in

   evidence against them and maintained that they are

   innocent.




5.In the statement filed by the 1st accused, he pointed out

   that on the date of incident in the evening they had

   decided to go to the house of Sheeba and return on the

   next day. Unfortunately, in the evening on 10.03.2003, a

   harthal was declared on 11.03.2003 and therefore the

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               5



   1st accused knew that he would be able to return only

   on 12.03.2003. He could not stay so long in the house

   of his wife, so he asked Sheeba not to go her house on

   10.03.2003 also because on those days his aged mother

   will have to stay alone in the house. When he returned

   in the evening on 10.03.2003, she got angry and went

   inside and locked the room. Since nothing was heard

   from the room, he threw open the door and found

   Sheeba hanging. Finding that the accused could not be

   acquitted under Section 232 Cr.P.C. They were asked to

   enter on their defence. They examined D.W.1.




6.The court below presumably impressed by the evidence

   of P.Ws.1, 2 and 5 and also Ext.P4 came to the

   conclusion that the accused persons had ill-treated the

   victim continuously and that ultimately led to her

   suicide.      On that premises the accused were found

   guilty on both counts. The convictions and sentences as

   already mentioned followed.

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                                 6



7.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant

   complained that the lower court was over enthusiastic in

   finding the accused guilty on both counts. On a close

   scrutiny of the evidence, according to the learned

   counsel, it can be seen that there is absolutely no

   evidence as against the 1st accused to rope him either

   under Sections 498A or 306 of IPC. Of course, at the

   time of evidence P.Ws.1 and 2 had deviated a lot from

   their earlier statement to the police and those additions

   cannot be taken as true. Even assuming that the 2nd

   accused had beaten the victim on one occasion, there is

   want of evidence to show that there was persist out and

   consistent acts of cruelty by either of the 1st or 2nd

   accused as contemplated under Section 498A IPC.

   Isolated instances cannot fall within the ambit of Section

   498A IPC. Usual family squabbles and quarrels do not

   form subject matter of Section 498A IPC.             It is

   continuous,       consistent, persistent cruel treatment

   making the life difficult for the victim that is

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                                7



   contemplated under Section 498A IPC. Except for the

   solitary instance of having been beaten with the wooden

   log there is no other incident mentioned either by

   P.Ws.1 and 2 with respect of either 1st and 2nd accused

   which would amount to a cruel acts as contemplated by

   law.




8.At any rate, according to the learned counsel for the

   appellant, it is too far fetched to hold that the accused

   guilty of the offence under Section 306 of IPC. There is

   nothing to show that as on the date of incident any

   untoward incident had occurred which instigated the

   victim to commit suicide or that the 1st and 2nd accused

   had played any role in driving the victim to commit

   suicide. In fact the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 would also

   show that even though the victim had complained to

   them about the ill-treatment, they never dreamt that

   she would commit suicide, there were no such

   contingency existing in the matrimonial house. In all

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               8



   probability according to the learned counsel for the

   appellant, the fact that on 10.03.2003, Sheeba, who had

   prepared herself to go home for a certain function as

   requested by her mother, when P.W.2 told her that they

   could not go, might have got agitated and might have

   taken the extreme step.      The learned counsel drew

   attention of this Court to the testimony of P.W.2, the

   mother who says that her daughter namely, Sheeba, the

   victim used to got agitated easily and was a very

   dedicate women. There is absolute want of evidence

   according to the learned counsel to show that the life of

   the victim in the matrimonial house was so miserable or

   that she was ill-treated to such an extent that she had

   no option but to commit suicide.          The essential

   ingredients to attract Section 498A and 306 IPC are

   conspicuously absent in the case on hand and therefore

   the conviction and sentence cannot stand.




9.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand tried

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               9



   very vehemently to sustain the conviction and sentence.

   According to her, the facts spoken to by P.Ws.1 and 2 at

   the time of evidence are sufficient to show that the life

   of the victim in the matrimonial house was far from

   pleasant and was in fact bitter and harsh.     That the

   victim was beaten with a wooden log cannot be

   disputed in view of the evidence of P.Ws.1, 2 and 5, and

   also Ext.P4 wound certificate said to have been drawn

   up by P.W.5. P.W.2 also speaks about the mark seen on

   the cheeks of victim when she had come to take the

   polio vaccine for her child on 08.03.2003. The evidence

   of P.W.2 also discloses various overt act on the part of

   2nd accused, which is     unbecoming of a mother-in-law

   and which amounted to cruelty. It is very evident that

   on a reading of the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 that the

   life of the victim in the matrimonial house was

   miserable and she had no option but to take the

   extreme step. The court below was, therefore, perfectly

   justified in coming to the conclusion that the offences

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               10



   have been made out.




10.The marriage between the victim and the 1st accused

   was taken place on 15.07.2001. The couple had a child

   who was only 9 months old on the date of mishap which

   was on 10.03.2003. On that day Sheeba, the victim,

   was found hanging in the room in the matrimonial

   house. In spite of best efforts she could not be saved.




11.The allegation of the prosecution is that Sheeba, the

   victim, was driven to the necessity to take the extreme

   step left with no option due to the ill-treatment meted

   out to her by the 1st and 2nd accused right from the day

   of marriage. They used to taunt her for lack of beauty

   and also for several other things.




12.The evidence regarding the ill-treatment of Sheeba is

   furnished by P.Ws.1 and 2. P.W.1 is the brother of the

   victim and P.W.2 is the mother of the victim. According

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               11



   to P.W.1, almost after a month of the marriage, the

   accused persons used to make life difficult for the victim

   and began harassing her both mentally and physically.

   She was accused of having inadequate beauty and also

   that she had brought inadequate dowry.         He would

   further say that they used to continuously harass her

   and she used to tell about agony she suffered at the

   matrimonial house, whenever he visited her house. He

   then speaks about the incident in which the 2nd accused

   dealt a blow on the head of the victim with a wooden

   log. According to him, Sheeba, used to tell him that, the

   2nd accused could not tolerate the victim for using any

   articles in the matrimonial house. After the incident of

   beating with a wooden log when Sheeba continued to

   reside in her house, there was a mediation talks and she

   went back to her matrimonial house. Even thereafter

   the ill-treatment continued, he finally says that it was

   due to all these reasons Sheeba had committed suicide.

   In his cross examination which was brought to his notice

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               12



   that his statement regarding that a month after the

   marriage, the victim was subjected to cruelty is not seen

   in Ext.P1 F.I.S., he had no answer, so also his statement

   that is she was being continuously physically assaulted

   by the accused persons.




13.The other evidence regarding the ill-treatment is by

   P.W.2, the mother of the victim. According to her 2nd

   accused could not tolerate the victim leaving the house

   with the 1st accused. Sheeba was of dark complexion

   and that was not to the liking of the accused persons.

   She was not allowed to do anything in the matrimonial

   house. She would even go to the extent of saying that

   she was not adequately fed in the matrimonial house.

   They mentally tortured her to a considerable extent.

   She would also says that the 1st accused was in the

   habit of beating and kicking the victim. On a particular

   day according to the testimony, the 1st accused woke

   up hearing the quarrel between his mother and the

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                                 13



   victim and he is alleged to have told the victim that she

   need to obey what was told by his mother. She would

   further say that the 1st accused stood as a passive

   onlooker when the 2nd accused beat her with the

   wooden log.          She states that there was continuous

   harassment both physical and mental by the accused

   persons. Finally, she says that on 08.03.2003, Sheeba

   had come home with her child to take polio vaccination

   for her child, she happened to see a mark on her

   cheeks. She would also say that her husband namely 1st

   accused refused to go along with her to any place and

   she had to seek the help of P.W.2 for going anywhere.




14.Her attention was also drawn to the fact that most of

   her statements in chief examination do not find a place

   in      Section 161 Cr.P.C statement to the police.

   Emphasis was laid on the fact that her claim that the 1st

   accused supported the 2nd accused and when the 2nd

   accused beat the victim with the wooden log, 1st

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               14



   accused stood as a passive onlooker are not stated

   earlier to the police. She had no answer. So also it was

   brought to her notice that she had not stated to the

   police that she happened to find a mark of beating on

   her cheeks when the victim came on 08.03.2003 to take

   vaccination for her child. She was also confronted with

   the statement in her cross examination regarding fisting

   and kicking by the 1st accused and it was brought to the

   notice that there is no such statement to the police

   given by her.




15.Considerable reliance is placed by the prosecution on

   the evidence of P.W.5, who is the doctor, who happened

   to treat Sheeba, the victim, when she came to the

   hospital on being beaten with the wooden log by the 2nd

   accused i.e., on 28.10.2002. He examined the victim on

   that day and issued Ext.P4 wound certificate. Ext.P4

   wound certificate shows the wound on the scalp.

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               15



16.The above are the items of evidence regarding the ill-

   treatment both mental and physical alleged to have

   been meted out by the accused persons to the victim. It

   can be easily seen that there has been considerable

   development at the stage of evidence as regards the

   overt act attributed to the 1st accused is concerned. Of

   course, in Ext.P1 furnished by P.W.1, it is stated that a

   short while after marriage 1st and 2nd accused used to

   pick up quarrel between the victim, it also makes

   mention of the beating with the wooden log by the 2nd

   accused. There is no mention in Ext.P1 regarding any

   demand for money or any complaint regarding the lack

   of beauty of Sheeba. As far as the evidence of P.W.2 is

   concerned, it can be seen there has been considerable

   developments and embellishments at the time of

   evidence.        Most of her crucial statements in chief

   examination do not find a place in her statement to the

   police. These omissions being on vital aspects cannot

   be easily ignored. There is considerable force of the

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               16



   submissions made by the learned counsel for the

   appellant that those developments were deliberately

   made to rope in the 1st accused.




17.If the omissions and the contradictions are eschewed

   from consideration, all that we have left is with the

   statements that 1st and 2nd accused used to mentally

   and physically harass the victim and also regarding the

   act of beating by the 2nd accused. One could even go to

   the extent of saying that there is enough evidence to

   show that the relationship between the deceased and

   the 2nd accused was far from cordial.




18.No specific overt act were attributed to the 1st accused

   except that P.W.2 at the time of evidence would say

   that he used to fist and kick the victim. This as already

   noticed is conspicuously absent in her statement to the

   police, so that it cannot be taken into consideration at

   all. Moreover, P.W.1 has no such case at all. P.W.1 says

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                                 17



   that what are happening in the matrimonial house was

   conveyed to him by his sister whenever she used to

   come home.           If as a matter of fact she used to be

   physically assaulted, obviously, the victim would have

   informed her brother about the same.




19.The 1st accused at the time of question under Section

   313 Cr.P.C. was admitted that on 10.03.2003, ill-fated

   day, Sheeba had made all preparations to go home and

   he too had agreed to go to the house of Sheeba on that

   day, to attend a function in her house. Unfortunately, a

   harthal was declared on 11.03.2003 and then the 1st

   accused realised that if he goes on 10.03.2003, he

   would be returned only on 12.03.2003 and he was not in

   a position to stay a day in the house of the victim,

   mainly because, his aged mother would be alone at

   home and further he was an autorikshaw driver by

   profession. He would say that Sheeba got agitated and

   she went inside the room. From the evidence of P.W.2 it

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               18



   is clear that the victim was a women of moods and she

   used to get agitated at the slightest pretext. Whatever

   that be, there is absolutely no evidence in this case that

   either on the day of incident or on the previous day

   there was any untoward incident had happened in the

   matrimonial house of the victim, which forced or

   compelled the victim to commit suicide.        It may be

   remembered that the act of beating occurred on

   28.10.2002, after that till 10.03.2003 there is no

   mention of any overt act either by the 1st and 2nd

   accused. Of course, the 2nd accused is attributed with

   certain acts which prevented the victim from making

   use of the articles in the house or doing anything in the

   house.




20.Probably it could be said that there is enough evidence

   as against the 2nd accused regarding the ill-treatment

   both physical and mental. But as far as the 1st accused

   is concerned except possibly for saying that he might

                               19



   have remained passive when his mother acted cruelly to

   the victim there were no acts to prove as against the 1st

   accused which would amount to a cruel act falling within

   the ambit of Section 498A of IPC.




21.As regards offence under Section 306 of IPC, it is

   difficult to understand how the lower court came to the

   conclusion that the said offence is made out as against

   1st and 2nd accused. Section 306 of IPC contemplates a

   situation whereby the person accused of that the

   offence instigates the victim to commit suicide.        It

   contemplates an intention on the part of the abettal it

   interferes facilitating commission of the act by the

   victim by the accused. The situation should be such

   that due to the act of either party the victim was driven

   to commit suicide or is such a situation is created by the

   accused, the victim is left with no option but to commit

   suicide.      Whatever that be, the accused must have

   acted with the intention that the victim should commit

Crl.Appeal No. 1048 of 2006

                               20



   suicide, a person can instigate a thing only if he has

   knowledge about that thing.




22.Even going by the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2, who

   speaks about the ill-treatment meted out to the victim

   they never dreamed or they never felt that there was

   any such circumstance in the matrimonial house which

   would have compelled the victim to commit suicide and

   as already noticed there is no incident spoken to by

   anybody were proved or as on the date of incident there

   is any incident which could be termed as instigating the

   victim to commit suicide. By no such of imagination for

   the offence under Section 306 of IPC is attracted.




23.Thus, while upholding the conviction of the 2nd accused

   for the offence under Section 498A IPC, the conviction

   of the 1st accused for the offence under Sections 498A

   and 306 of IPC are set aside and so also the sentence

   awarded against him. The 2nd accused is held not guilty

                               21



   for the offence under Section 306 of IPC also. She is

   acquitted of the said charge. Coming to the sentence

   awarded to the 2nd accused for the offence under

   Section 498A IPC, considering that the incident has

   occurred in 2003 and the passage of time and the age

   of the 2nd accused and sentence imposed seems to be

   harsh. Considering the various circumstances, it is felt

   that some leniency can be shown with regard to the

   sentence as far as the 2nd accused is concerned.




   This appeal is partly allowed mentioned above in the

   sentence awarded to the 2nd accused for the offence

   under Section 498A IPC is set aside and she is

   sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year

   and to pay a fine of `2,500/- with a default clause of

   simple imprisonment for three months. Set of as per

   law will be allowed.

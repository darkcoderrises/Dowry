                   =================
          CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014
               =====================
              Dated this the 11th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER
                              --------


      Crl.M.C.No.1405/14 was filed by the accused numbers 1

and 2 in CC.No.383/2012 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Muvattupuaha and Crl.M.C.No.1418/2014 was

filed by the accused persons in C.P.No.36/2012 pending before

the same Court, both for quashing the proceedings on the basis

of settlement under section 482 of Code of the Criminal

Procedure.

      2.    The common case of both the petitioners in these

petitions is that, the petitioners in both the cases were friends

and on 25.3.2012 there was some tournament going on in the

paddy filed and some disputes arose in which both the

petitioners sustained injuries and two crimes were registered in

respect of the same incident. On the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent in Crl.M.C.No.1405/2014 in

Crime No.141of 2012 of Piravom police station was registered

against the petitioners in that petition alleging offences under

sections 323, 324 and r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code

and after investigation final report was filed and the case is

pending as CC.No.383 of 2012. On the basis of statement given

by the second respondent in Crl.M.C.No.1418 of 2014 in Crime

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 2

No.140 0f 2012 was registered against the petitioners in that

case who are the respondents in Crl.M.C.No.1405 of 2014

alleging offences under Sections 323, 324, 326, 506(1), 307 and

r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and after investigation

final report was filed and the same is pending as CP.No36 of

2011 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Muvattupuzha. It is seen from the averments that the petitioners

in both the cases are relatives and neighbours. Due to the

intervention of mediators and well wishers and family members,

the dispute between them has been resolved and their

relationship has been restored and on account of the settlement

both parties decided not to proceed with the prosecution against

each other. According to the petitioners, in view of the

settlement, no conviction will be possible and it will be only a

wastage of judicial time and since offences alleged in both the

cases are non compoundable in nature, they could not file the

application for compounding before the Courts below. So they

have no other remedy except to approach this Court seeking the

following relief:

Crl.No.1405 of 2014:

      to quash Annexure-A1 charge and all further proceedings

      against the petitioenrs in CC.No.383 of 2013 pending before

      the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha.

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 3

Crl.No.1418 of 2014:

      to quash Annexure-A1 charge and all further proceedings

      against the petitioenrs in CP.No.36 of 2013 pending

      before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

      Muvattupuzha.

      3.    Defacto complainant injured in both the cases

appeared through counsel and submitted that the matter has

been settled and they do not want to prosecute each other in

view of the settlement and they have filed separate affidavits

before this Court stating these facts. They also stated that on

account of the settlement, the original relationship between

them has been restored and they were now living happily.

      4.    The counsel for the petitioners in both the cases also

submitted that     in view of the settlement conviction in both

cases are remote and so they prayed for allowing the

application.

      5.    The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there are no other cases

against the petitioners but opposed the application on the

ground that grave offences have been incorporated.

      6.    It is an admitted fact that the petitioners in both the

cases who are accused in the respective cases are neighbours

and some of them were related to each other as well. It is also

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 4

an admitted fact that the incident happened at a time when they

were playing in a paddy field and when a dispute arose in the

course of play some incident happened and both of them have

sustained injuries in the incident. It is also an admitted fact that

on the basis of the statements given by the respective defacto

complainants Crime Nos.140 of 2012 and 141 of 2012 were

registered by Piravom police and after investigation final reports

were filed and in respect of Crime No.140 of 2012 and it is now

pending as CP.No.36 of 2012 and in respect of Crime No.141 of

2012,   it was pending as CC.No.380 of 2012 and both these

cases were pending before the same Court namely Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha. Now the matter has been

settled between the parties on account of the settlement the old

relationship between the neighbours and relatives have been

restored. In view of the settlement there is no possibility of

conviction.

      8.     It is true that in one of the cases grave offences like

326 and 307 of the Indian penal Code have been incorporated.

Since case and counter cases have been registered and both the

cases have been settled between the parties, even if the cases

were allowed to continue and trial was conducted none of the

parties will support the case of the prosecution and it will end in

acquittal only and this will amount to wastage of judicial time as

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 5

well.

     9.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The  position   that  emerges    from    the  above

     discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

     High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or

     complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

     and different from the power given to a criminal court for

     compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

     Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

     limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

     guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

     ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

     any Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal

     proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where

     the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

     depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

     no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise

     of such power, the High Court must have due regard to

     the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

     offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,

     rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

     though the victim or victim's family and the offender have

     settled the dispute.    Such offences are not private in

     nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

     compromise between the victim and offender in relation

     to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of

     Corruption Act or the offences committed by public

     servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot

     provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings

     involving such offences.    But the criminal cases having

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 6

     overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand

     on different footing for the purposes of quashing,

     particularly   the  offences   arising  from   commercial,

     financial, mercantile, civil,   partnership or such like

     transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

     relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the

     wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

     parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this

     category of case, High Court may quash criminal

     proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

     between the offender and victim, the possibility of

     conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

     criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

     prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him

     by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

     complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In

     other words, the High Court must consider whether it

     would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

     continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of

     the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of

     process of law despite settlement and compromise

     between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure

     the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

     put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

     affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

     jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

     10.    In view of the dictum laid on in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the accused and defacto

complainant in both the cases are relatives and neighbours and

the matters has been settled between the parties and on account

of the settlement, their old relationship has been restored and

CRL.M.C.NOs.1405 OF 2014 & 1418 OF 2014 7

there is no possibility of conviction even if it is allowed to

continue, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code has to be invoked

to quash the proceedings in order to promote the settlement

which resulted harmony between the neighbours and relatives.

      So the petitions are allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.383 of 2012 (Crime No.141 of 2012 of Piravom police

station) as against the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1405 of 2014

and in CP.No.36 of 2012 (Crime No.140 of 2012 of Piravom

police station) as against the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1418 of

2014 both pending in Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Muvattupuzha are hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

Court for necessary further action.

                 Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the sole accused in

C.C.No.42/12 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Paravur, Kollam, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.436 of 2011 of Parippally Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Section 498 A of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexures-1 to 3       private

complaint, FIR and final report in the above crime and the

proceedings in the above calendar case, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.  The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner is the husband of the 2nd respondent/de facto

complainant    and   the    he   misappropriated   the gold

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                             2

ornaments that were presented by the parents of the de

facto complainant at the time of marriage, for his personal

use and thereafter, the accused started harassing the de

facto complainant both mentally and physically for more

dowry. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case.      Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received      from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                               3

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

against him.

         6.    I    have carefully   considered   the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offence

involved in the above case is only under Section 498 A of

I.P.C. which is more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved.     It is pertinent to note that

though such an offence is involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.      From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                                    4

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.      In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the

Honourable Apex Court, in the decision reported in

Jitendra       Raghuvanshi           and     Others      v.   Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)],

has held as follows:-

                "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes
         have been on considerable increase in recent times
         resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A
         and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also
         against the relatives of the husband. The question is
         when such matters are resolved either by the wife
         agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual
         settlement of other pending disputes for which both
         the sides approached the High Court and jointly
         prayed for quashing of the criminal proceedings or the
         FIR or complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and
         406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on
         the sole ground that since the offences are non-
         compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it would
         be impermissible for the court to quash the criminal
         proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand
         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint
         under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3
         and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the
         help and intervention of family members, friends and
         well-wishers, the parties concerned have amicably
         settled      their   differences    and   executed     a
         compromise/settlement.          Pursuant  thereto,   the
         appellants filed the said compromise before the Trial
         Court with a request to place the same on record and

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                                    5

         to   drop     the criminal   proceedings   against   the
         appellants herein.    It is also not in dispute that in
         additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the
         parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit
         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal
         proceedings against the appellants and fully supported
         the contents of the settlement deed.          It is the
         grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court
         rejected such prayer of the parties but also the High
         Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction under Section
         482 of the Code only on the ground that the criminal
         proceedings relate to the offences punishable under
         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
         compoundable in nature."

                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to
         encourage      genuine    settlements   of  matrimonial
         disputes,    particularly, when    the   same   are   on
         considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes
         and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled
         the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold
         that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,
         Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the
         exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
         subsequent criminal proceedings.
                    13.    There   has   been   an   outburst   of
         matrimonial disputes in recent times. The institution
         of marriage occupies an important place and it has an
         important role to play in the society. Therefore, every
         effort should be made in the interest of the individuals
         in order to enable them to settle down in life and live
         peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults
         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
         agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law,
         in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
         matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to
         state that the power under Section 482 should be
         exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
         when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material
         on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
         would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                                  6

         the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought
         to be quashed."

In the present case, the only offence involved is under

Section 498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the

said offence originated from the matrimonial issues are

now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus to

the criminal case as well.

         8.     According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.              It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court,     in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be

Crl.M.C.No.4132 of 2014
                               7

sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decision cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures-1 to 3 private complaint, FIR and final report in

Crime No.436 of 2011 of Parippally Police Station and all

further proceedings pending against the petitioner in

C.C.No.42/12 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Paravur, Kollam.

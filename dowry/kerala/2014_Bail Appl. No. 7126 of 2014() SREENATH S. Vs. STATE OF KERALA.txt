                  ---------------------------------
             Dated this the 10th day of October, 2014.

                             O R D E R



       Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.938/2014 of

Kondotty Police Station, Malappuram District registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 323 and 341 IPC.

Brief of the prosecution case is that the petitioner had

assaulted his wife on 26.8.2014, that she was hospitalised on

the same day, that wound certificate shows the wound suffered

by the defacto complainant are abrasions (minor injury) and

that the petitioner was demanding for more dowry etc.

Sri.Wilson Urmese, the learned counsel for the petitioner would

submit that the petitioner is totally innocent of the allegations

raised against him by his wife and that his wife had developed

a friendship with a person by name Sri.Vijayan through face

book network and that this created certain problems in the

relationship in their family life and that the wound is a self

inflicted wound and certain other aspects alleging the

involvement of the aforementioned "face book friend"

Sri.Vijayan are also mentioned in the memorandum of bail

application.

B.A No.7126 Of 2014

      2.   The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that

investigation is going on and that the wound certificate issued

by the competent medical officer would show that the wound

suffered by the defacto complainant is abrasion which is a

minor injury. Sri.Wilson Urmese, the learned counsel for the

petitioner, would strongly urge that the petitioner may be

granted anticipatory bail and that he would fully co-operate

with the investigation and that he is prepared to abide by any

condition as may be imposed by this Court in order to protect

the bonafide interest of the prosecution.

      3.   Having heard the learned counsel for the learned

counsel for the petitioner and learned Public Prosecutor and on

a careful evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case,

I am inclined to exercise discretion to grant anticipatory bail to

the petitioner subject to conditions so as to protect the interest

of the prosecution. Accordingly it is ordered that in the event

of the petitioner being arrested in connection with Crime

No.938/2014 of Kondotti Police Station, then the petitioner

shall be released on bail on his execution of a bond for `

35,000/- (Rupees Thirtyfive Thousand only) before the

investigating officer and on furnishing two sureties of the same

amount to the satisfaction of the investigating officer and

subject to the following conditions:-

           (i) The petitioner shall surrender his passport,

     if any, before the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned

     within three days from the execution of the bail bond

     before the investigating officer and if he is not a

     passport holder, then he shall file affidavit to that

     effect in the said court. If the petitioner require his

     passport in connection with his travel abroad, then

     he is free to approach the court concerned for the

     release of the same and for necessary permission in

     that regard. In case if such an application is filed,

     the trial court or the jurisdictional Magistrate

     concerned, as the case may be, is free to consider

     the same on merits and to pass appropriate orders

     thereon,    taking    necessary    guidance  from   the

     principles laid down in the decision of this Court in

     the case Asok Kumar v. State of Kerala, reported

     in   2009     (2)   KLT    712,    notwithstanding  the

     aforementioned conditions imposed by this Court.

           (ii)  Petitioner    shall    report  before   the

     investigating    officer  in    Crime No.938/2014    of

     Kondotti Police Station between 10:00 am and 11:00

     am on every alternate Sundays until the submission

     of the final report in this case.

cancelled.

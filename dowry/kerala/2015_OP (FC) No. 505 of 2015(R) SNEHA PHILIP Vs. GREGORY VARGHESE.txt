           ====================================
               Dated this the 17th day of November, 2015.


                             JUDGMENT

Abdul Rehim, J.


1. The petitioner herein, who is the petitioner before the Family Court,

   Ernakulam in O.P.No.1701 of 2015, is approaching this court

   challenging Ext.P4 order passed by the Family Court in I.A.No.3981

   of 2015, on 06.10.2015. Original petition before the Family Court

   was instituted against the respondents herein, seeking recovery of

   money and gold ornaments. Specific case of the petitioner is that the

   ornaments described under Schedule I of the petition was kept in a

   Bank Locker jointly operated by the petitioner and the 1st respondent.

   Another case filed by the 1st respondent seeking for dissolution of

   marriage, before the Family Court, Ernakulam as O.P.No.2304 of

   2012 was transferred to the Family Court at Bangaluru and it was re-

O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2015           -:2:-




numbered as M.C.No.4635 of 2013. There is yet another case filed

by the petitioner under the Domestic Violence Act before the

Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Bangaluru as M.C.No.12 of 2013.

Further, a criminal case instituted by the petitioner against the 1st

respondent alleging offences punishable under Section 498A of the

Indian Penal Code and under the Dowry Prohibition Act is also

pending    disposal  before     the    Chief   Judicial Magistrate,

Thiruvananthapuram as C.C.No.3099 of 2014. The respondents have

filed Crl.M.C.No.4185 of 2015 before this court seeking to quash

that criminal case.     During pendency of the said Criminal

Miscellaneous Case before this court, the parties have arrived at a

compromise and Ext.P2 Mediation Agreement was executed, which

was signed by both the parties and their respective counsel. It is

evident from Ext.P2 that the parties have agreed to withdraw all the

cases pending before the Family Courts, subject to certain

conditions.   Conditions incorporated with respect to the gold

ornament kept in the Bank locker is as follows:

   O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2015               -:3:-




        "Parties also agree that they will cooperate in the matter of

        opening the locker no.25/2 in State Bank of India, Edapally

        branch, Ernakulam in presence of both the parties or their

        representatives and their counsel.

        The petitioner no.3 will hand over to respondent no.1 Sneha

        Philip her gold ornaments which are taken from the locker

        no.25/2, after opening it, as stated above, on the day the

        compromise petition is filed before the Family Court, Bangalore

        or when the sworn statement is made before the Family Court at

        Ernakulam."

2. On the basis of the above said settlement, the petitioner had filed

   Ext.P3 application for appointment of an Advocate Commissioner to

   break open the Bank Locker based on orders to be issued by the

   court and to make a verification with respect to the gold ornaments

   kept therein in the presence of parties to the case or their duly

   authorised agents and a qualified Approver of the Bank, and to

   entrust the gold and diamond ornaments detailed under Schedule 1 to

   the petitioner. The said application was dismissed through Ext.P4

   order finding that the application for appointment of the

   Commissioner is made only with an objective to collect evidence in

   O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2015             -:4:-




   the case, which cannot be allowed.

3. Contention of the petitioner is that the court below ought to have

   allowed    the  application     for   appointment   of   an Advocate

   Commissioner on the basis of Ext.P2 compromise so as to bring the

   compromise into effect and for entitling the parties to withdraw the

   case. But we notice that the prayer in Ext.P3 interim application is to

   appoint an Advocate Commissioner for breaking open the Locker

   and to make a verification of the ornaments and to handover the

   ornaments to the petitioner on the basis of the schedule of ornaments

   attached therewith. Definitely the relief sought for is against the

   terms and spirit of the compromise, as rightly observed by the

   Family Court. First of all, it is conceded that the key of the Locker is

   missing from the parties and it has to be opened through other

   methods. It is not permissible for the court to depute an Advocate

   Commissioner to break open a Bank Locker, which may cause

   damage to the property of the Bank, who is not a party to the

   litigation. If the key of the Locker is lost, the parties have to

O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2015            -:5:-




approach the authorities of the Bank to take appropriate steps to get

it opened through methods available as per formalities and procedure

of the Bank. The Locker can be opened only at the instance of the

Bank authorities after undergoing such requisite formalities. Further,

if the parties have already arrived at a settlement in accordance with

the terms contained in Ext.P2, it is left open to them to approach the

Family Court, Ernakulam for endorsing the compromise by

producing the Memorandum of Agreement before that court or by

filing any appropriate joint petition. The parties will be at liberty to

incorporate the terms for implementation of the compromise if

necessary by seeking assistance of the court to depute an Advocate

Commissioner to handover the ornaments contained in the Locker, to

the petitioner on its opening. Since there is no dispute expressed in

Ext.P2 agreement with respect to the quantity or quality of the

ornaments contained in the Bank Locker, it is not necessary to depute

an Advocate Commissioner and to make any inventory or

verification in order to ascertain as to whether it is the same

   O.P.(FC) No.505 of 2015            -:6:-




   ornaments as scheduled in the petition. Since the application is not

   submitted in a manner as mentioned above, the Family Court was

   right in rejecting the application by observing that it is an attempt to

   create evidence in the case instituted before that court, which cannot

   be allowed.

4. However, if the parties are intending to abide by the terms of the

   compromise and is intending to settle the case accordingly, they will

   be left free to approach the Family Court in appropriate petition

   seeking appropriate reliefs.

5. Subject to liberty reserved as mentioned above, this original petition

   is dismissed, since we do not find any reason to interfere with the

   impugned order, that too by invoking the visitorial jurisdiction

   vested under Article 227 of the Constitution.




                                     C.K.Abdul Rehim, Judge.


                                         Mary Joseph, Judge.

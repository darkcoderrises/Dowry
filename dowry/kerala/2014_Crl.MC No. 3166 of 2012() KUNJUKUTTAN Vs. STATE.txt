               ------------------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C.No.3166 of 2012
               ------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 8th day of January, 2014.

                                O R D E R


            Petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.663/2012

of Munnar Police Station. The charges levelled against the petitioner

and the first accused in the crime are punishable under Section 498 A

IPC.

      2.    The crime was registered on the basis of a complaint

filed before the learned Magistrate, which was forwarded under

Section 156(3) Cr.P.C for investigation. Brief allegations in

Annexure I complaint are that the complainant/3rd respondent was

married to the first accused, who is the son of the petitioner that their

marriage was solemnised under the provisions of Special Marriage

Act at Sub Registrar Office, Devikulam and it was on 13-06-2011.

Till 15-06-2011 first accused and the complainant resided at

Nallathanni Estate at Devikulam, where the house of the

complainant is situated. On 15-06-2011, first accused went to his

place of work at Ernakulam. Thereafter, he could not be contacted. It

is the allegation in the complaint that the petitioner over phone

Crl.M.C.No.3166 of 2012           2




demanded dowry from the complainant and stated that without

dowry, she would not be allowed to come to his house. Learned

counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if the entire allegations

in the complaint are taken together, they will not establish an offence

under Section 498A IPC. Learned counsel for the petitioner would

rely on the decision in Rajesh Gutta v. State of A.P and Others

(2011 KHC 573) to argue a proposition that merely some reference

is made regarding the demand of dowry in a complaint, it will not

reveal an offence punishable under Section 498 A IPC.

      3.      Learned counsel for the petitioner would further rely on

a decision of the Apex Court in Girdhar Shankar Tawade v. State

of Maharashtra ((2002)5 SCC 177) to contended that the term

'cruelty' defined in Explanation under Section 498A IPC, especially

in clause (b) therein, in no uncertain terms records harassment of a

woman and the statute itself thereafter clarifies it to the effect that it

is not every such harassment, but only in the event of such a

harassment being with a view to coerce her or any person related to

her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable

Crl.M.C.No.3166 of 2012             3




security. In this case, there is no averment in the complaint,

contended the learned counsel for the petitioner.

      4.      Learned counsel for the complainant would submit that

to her knowledge, the investigation has proceeded and culminated in

filing a final report before the court below.

      5.      Annexure 3 is the judgment passed by Division Bench of

this court in writ petition W.P(C) No.381/2011. It is seen that the

complainant filed a writ petition requesting the issuance of a Writ of

Habeas Corpus against respondents, including the petitioner herein,

for alleged unlawful detention of her husband. That matter was

disposed of by the Division Bench with the following observations :

                      "Read the earlier orders. The alleged

              detenu is present. He says that he works

              somewhere in Orissa. He candidly says that he

              is not under the illegal detention of respondents

              5 and 6, as alleged. He also states that he is not

              interested to go with the petitioner. We record

              the submission. We do not think that the alleged

              detenu is under illegal detention. The matter is

              hence closed."

Crl.M.C.No.3166 of 2012             4




      6.      Considering the materials on record, I am of the view

that there is no allegation in the complaint justifying the implication

of the petitioner in an offence under Section 498A IPC. Since it is

not evident as to whether a final report has been filed by the

Investigating Officer before the court below, I hereby dispose of the

Crl.M.C with following directions :

      It is clear that the averments in the petition are not sufficient to

implicate him in an offence under 498A IPC. Therefore, the

petitioner is free to claim discharge before the trial court, if a final

report had already been filed. In that event, the petitioner shall be

granted exemption from personal appearance before the court below.

It is also made clear that the petitioner is at liberty to challenge the

final report, if any filed in this matter in appropriate proceedings.

      All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.

                      Crl.M.C.No. 5483 of 2014
                    ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 29th day of September, 2014

                                 O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 4 and 5             in Crime No. 53/90 of

Payyannur Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

143,447,427 read with Section 149          of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-I charge sheet (charge sheet No.4/91) in Crime No.53/1990 of

Payyannur Police Station, Kannur District as the matter is settled out of

court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 10.3.1990, the

accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and in prosecution

of their common object of committing wrongful loss to CW2, criminally

trespassed into the property of CW2 in Re-survey No.200/2D at Mattool

Junction and demolished the shop building of CW1 and thereby, caused

wrongful loss of `25,000/- and thus, committed the offences punishable

Crl.M.C.No.5483 of 2014


                                     :-2-:

under Sections 143,447,427 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. and now, the

case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second and third respondents.         I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second and third respondents, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents, submitted that

the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant/victim/injured does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

Crl.M.C.No.5483 of 2014


                                        :-3-:

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

143,447,427 read with Section 149               of I.P.C., which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached

this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the second and third respondents, it appears to me that the

injured/the victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.            In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

Crl.M.C.No.5483 of 2014


                                           :-4-:

           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

Crl.M.C.No.5483 of 2014


                                      :-5-:

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure-I charge

sheet (charge sheet No.4/91) in Crime No.53/1990 of Payyannur Police

Station, Kannur District.

                                                                      Judge

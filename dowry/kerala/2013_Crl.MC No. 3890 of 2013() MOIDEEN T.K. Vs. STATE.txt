                Crl.M.C.No.3890 of 2013
         ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013

                          ORDER

     The above petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C is jointly

moved by the accused as well as the defacto complainant in

Crime No.54/2011 of Adhur Police Station, Kasaragod with a

prayer to quash Annexure-1 charge and all further prosecution

proceedings pending against petitioners No. 1 to 4 who are

accused in C.C.No.2043/2011 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.

     2. Heard the counsel for the petitioners.

     3. In fact, Crime No.54/2011 on Adhur Police Station is

registered at the instance of the 5th petitioner who is the

defacto complainant and when the Police completed the

investigation in the above crime, they have filed Annexure-1

charge sheet. The allegation in the Police charge is that on

8/4/20210 the defacto complainant was married by the first

accused, who is the first petitioner herein as per religious

customs and rites prevailing among the Muslim community and

while the defaco complainant was residing in her matrimonial

home she was intimidated demanding more dowry and she

was subjected to cruelty both physically and mentally

Crl.M.C.No.3890 of 2013
                                2

demanding 10 sovereigns of gold towards dowry and thus the

accused has committed the offences punishable under Sections

498(A), 342, 506(i) r/w Section 34 of IPC.

      4. According to the petitioners who are the accused and

the defaco complainant, subsequent to the initiation of the

criminal proceedings the entire disputes both matrimonial as

well as the criminal are settled through intervention of

relatives and well wishers of          both the parties and

consequently they executed Annexure-2 agreement. As per the

terms of the Annexure-2 agreement it is incumbent upon the

parties to approach this Court to get quashed the criminal

proceedings pending against the accused in C.C.No.2043/2011

on the file of the Court below. Thus the present M.C is filed. As

directed by this Court, the 5th respondent who is the defcto

complainant had sworn into an affidavit dated 13/8/2013,

which produced before this Court by the learned counsel for

the petitioners form part of this M.C proceedings.

      5.   As the defacto complainant herself along with the

other accused approached this Court to quash criminal

proceedings pending against the accused in the above case,

according to me, this Court need not stand in the way and to

Crl.M.C.No.3890 of 2013
                                  3

disturb the settlement arrived by the parties and especially

when the criminal proceedings are initiated out of matrimonial

dispute. On the other hand, it is the duty of this Court by

following the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] to

promote     such    settlement    and   to  quash    the  criminal

proceedings pending against one of the parties to the dispute.

      In the result, this M.C is allowed quashing Annexure-1

charge and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners 1 to 4 who are accused in C.C.No.2043/2011 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.

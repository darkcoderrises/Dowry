           Dated this the 12th August, 2014

                         JUDGMENT

Ashok Bhushan, Ag.CJ.

     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Government Pleader.

     2. By this Writ Petition the petitioner has prayed for a

mandamus directing respondents 1 and 2 to provide

adequate and effective police protection to the life of the

petitioner and her daughter. Allegation in the Writ Petition

has been made against the third respondent, father-in-law

of the petitioner. The allegation is that demand of dowry

has been made from the petitioner.

     3. The learned Government Pleader, after obtaining

instruction, submitted that there was a dispute between

the petitioner and the third respondent, which has now

been amicably settled. It is submitted that there is no law

and order situation in the matter.

  WP(C).19956/14             2

     4. In the aforesaid, we are of the view that if any

cognizable or non-cognizable offence is committed by any

of the respondents, it shall be open for the petitioner to

take action permissible under the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     With the above observation, the Writ Petition is

disposed of.

                 ==========================

                     Transfer Petition (Criminal) No. 14 of 2008

                 ==========================

                  Dated this the 5th day of February, 2008.


                                     O R D E R




       The   petitioner,   who   is   the   de   facto   complainant   in   Crime   No.


431/2006   of   Anchal   Police   Station   for   an   offence   punishable   under


Section   498A   r/w   Section   34   IPC   and   section   4   of   the   Dowry


Prohibition Act, seeks a transfer  of the case now pending as C.C No.


318/2007 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Punalur, to


any other court.


       2.  According to the petitioner, her husband (the 1st accused) and


her father-in-law (the 3rd  accused) are both lawyers practising before


the Punalur Court and even though she had made a request before the


Punalur Magistrate on the first date of her examination that she may


be given some time to move the appropriate court for transferring the


case,  that was not heeded to and she was compelled to give evidence


and the evidence  for the  other prosecution witnesses  also  was taken


much against her objection.


       3.   The learned  counsel appearing for respondents 1 to 3, who


are   accused   Nos.   1   to   3,   submitted   that   already   16   witnesses   have


been examined and that it may be harsh to transfer the case at this


stage  of   the   proceedings.     Alternately,  it  was   submitted   that   in   case


Tr.P.C No. 14/2008                        : 2:





this Court were  to order  transfer of the case, the same may be to a


Magistrate at Kollam.


       4.  In fact the 1st accused, who is the husband of the petitioner,


had approached this Court by filing Crl.M.C. No. 54/2008 for an early


disposal of the above case alleging that he is a practising lawyer and


had   also   sought   personal   exemption   from   appearance   before   the


Magistrate.     The   said   petition   filed   as   Crl.M.C.   No.   54/2008   was


disposed   of   by   this   Court   without   ordering   notice   on   the   petitioner


herein by directing the Magistrate to dispose of the case within three


months of  receipt of a copy of the order.


       5.     The   fact   that   accused   Nos.1   and   3   are   advocate   practising


before   the   very   same   trial   court   can   certainly   place   them   at   an


advantage   before   the Magistrate.   The   1st  accused had also   obtained


an order behind the back of his wife (the petitioner herein) for an early


disposal of the case by the Punalur Magistrate.  Whatever may by the


reason   which   prompted   him   to   file   the   said   petition,   his   application


indicates that he had obtained a direction to the effect that the Punalur


Magistrate should dispose  of the case within the time-frame  fixed by


this Court.  Considering the fact that this is a case involving the alleged


commission of matrimonial cruelty, I see no reason why the prayer in


Tr.P.C No. 14/2008                         : 3:





the   petition   should   not   be   granted.     The   petitioner   is   a   resident   of


Adoor and is stated to be working at Ernakulam.  The learned counsel


appearing for respondents 1 to 3 submitted that in case this Court is


inclined to transfer the case it may be to Kollam.   I see no relevance


for   the   choice   mentioned   by   respondents   1   to   3.     All   of   them   are


residents   of   Anchal   within   the   jurisdiction   of   the   Punalur   Magistrate.


Accordingly, C.C. No. 318/2007 pending before the Judicial First Class


Magistrate-I, Punalur shall stand transferred to the Judicial First Class


Magistrate, Adoor who shall make an earnest endeavour to dispose of


the case at the earliest and at any rate within 45 days of receipt of a


copy of this order.


        6.  The registry shall forward a copy of this order to both JFCM,


Punalur as well as the JFCM, Adoor for information and compliance.  I


make   it   clear   that   the   transferee   court   need   not   conduct   a   de   novo


trial.  The witnesses whose examination is already completed need not


be examined again.





                                                    V. RAMKUMAR, JUDGE.

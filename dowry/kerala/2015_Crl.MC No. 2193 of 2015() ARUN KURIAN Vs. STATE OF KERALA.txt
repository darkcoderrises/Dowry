                          O R D E R



    Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 3 in

C.C.No.1386/2014 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam. The above

case was initiated on the basis of a private complaint

filed by the second respondent as CMP No.1740/2014.

The second respondent is the de facto complainant in

the above case. After taking cognizance under Section

190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all the disputes

between the petitioners and the second respondent

were settled in the mediation held at the District

Mediation Centre, Ernakulam.            As per the terms of

mediation, both parties agreed to withdraw all the

cases filed by both against each other before all

courts. Now the second respondent has no subsisting

grievance against the petitioners and she do not

intend to proceed with the criminal case. That apart,

Crl.M.C.2193/14-C               :2:



the first petitioner and the second respondents

resumed their marital relationship and now living as

husband and wife peacefully.           Under the above

circumstances, this petition is filed under Section

482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the entire proceedings.

      2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,

the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel

for the second respondent. Both the counsel urged for

quashing the entire proceedings under Annexure-A1

complaint        invoking inherent   jurisdiction  under

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

      3.     The learned counsel for the petitioners drew

my attention to the decision laid down by the Apex

Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108

(SC)] in support of his arguments.

      4. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT

108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the

Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question

whether the High Court has power to quash criminal

Crl.M.C.2193/14-C                 :3:



proceedings involving non-compoundable offences on

the basis of the compromise reached between the

offender and the victim and answered as given below:

         "57.     The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:
         the power of the High Court in quashing a
         criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
         exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given
         to a criminal court for compounding the
         offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent
         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or
         (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
         Court.    In what cases power to quash the
         criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.
         may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed.
         However, before exercise of such power, the
         High Court must have due regard to the
         nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
         serious offences of mental depravity or
         offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,
         cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
         victim or victim's family and the offender
         have settled the dispute. Such offences are
         not private in nature and have serious
         impact     on  society.      Similarly,   any
         compromise between the victim and offender
         in relation to the offences under special
         statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act
         or     the offences  committed    by   public
         servants while working in that capacity etc;
         cannot provide for any basis for quashing

Crl.M.C.2193/14-C                :4:



         criminal     proceedings    involving    such
         offences.    But the criminal cases having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes    of  quashing,  particularly   the
         offences arising from commercial, financial,
         mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
         family disputes where the wrong is basically
         private or personal in nature and the parties
         have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash
         criminal proceedings if in its view, because
         of the compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is
         remote, bleak and continuation of criminal
         case would put accused to great oppression
         and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
         caused to him by not quashing the criminal
         case despite full and complete settlement
         and compromise with the victim. In other
         words, the High Court must consider whether
         it would be unfair or contrary to the
         interest of justice to continue with the
         criminal proceeding or continuation of the
         criminal proceeding would tantamount to
         abuse of process of law despite settlement
         and compromise between the victim and
         wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
         justice, it is appropriate that criminal case
         is put to an end and if the answer to the
         above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
         Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
         quash the criminal proceeding."

      5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

Crl.M.C.2193/14-C              :5:



this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the

offences alleged against the petitioners will not

come      under    the category   of non-compoundable

offences,       which are specifically excluded  from

composition, in the exercise of inherent power under

Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by

the de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute

between the accused and the victim had been amicably

settled and at present the de facto complainant has

no subsisting grievance at all.         The de facto

complainant        does not  want   to  proceed  with

prosecution against the accused.        Full and final

settlement and compromise with the victim are

evidenced by Annexure-A3. In view of the compromise

between the first petitioner and the victim, I find

that the possibility of conviction is remote, bleak,

and continuation of the criminal case would put the

parties to great oppression, prejudice and also

Crl.M.C.2193/14-C              :6:



tantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The

present criminal prosecution against the accused

must be put to an end to secure the interest of

justice.

      6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against the petitioners under Annexure-A1 complaint

in C.C. No.1386/2014 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam will stand

quashed.

      This petition is allowed.

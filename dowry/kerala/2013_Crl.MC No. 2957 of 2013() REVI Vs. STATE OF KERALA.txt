                Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 25th day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.1058/2012 of the

ACJM Court, Ernakulam which is a case instituted upon the

police report for the offences punishable under Sections 120

(B), 420, 468, 471 and 34 of IPC of I.P.C., with a prayer to

quash the Annexure-A2 charge as against the petitioners as

the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that for the

purpose of taking Rs.3 lakh as hand loan for CW2, he had

borrowed the title deed of the 2nd respondent bearing

No.3137/97 in Sy.No.788/88 of Nadama Village, extending to

9.750 cents of property and a building thereon and also the

documents relates to a shop room in Cochin Corporation

bearing No.1717/C/6. The CW2 approached the 1st accused

for getting the said loan pledging the property of the 2nd

respondent.    The 1st accused also collected several blank

signed stamp papers from the 2nd respondent. Subsequently

the accused No.1 to 3 conspired with accused No. 4 & 5 in a

Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
                               2

building near Siva Temple, D.H. Road, Ernakulam.          The 1st

accused had taken a loan of Rs.30 lakhs from 5th accused and

forged a document to the effect that he had made agreement

for the sale of the 2nd respondent's property to the 5th accused.

When the CW2 returned the money borrowed from A1 and

requested for the documents. Subsequently the 1st accused

informed him that he had entrusted the said documents to the

accused No.4 & 5. On meeting with accused No.4 & 5, the

accused were created a forged sale agreement using the plain

signed stamp paper of 2nd respondent to the effect that his

property was agreed to transfer to the 5th accused for an

amount of Rs.60 lakhs and out of which, the 2nd respondent

has to receive Rs.40 lakh as advance.         According to the

prosecution, the accused No.1 to 5 committed criminal

conspiracy for the purpose of cheating the 2nd respondent,

obtained his property. Now, the case of the petitioners is that

the matter is settled out of court between the petitioners who

are accused Nos. 4 and 5 and the second respondent.

Annexure A3 is the compounding petition filed in the Sub Court

at Ottapalam. The defacto complainant, who is the second

respondent has also sworn into an affidavit dated 22/7/2013.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
                               3

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
                                    4

in the above case are only Sections 120(B), 420, 468, 471 and

34 of IPC of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
                                      5

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

Crl.M.C.No. 2957 of 2013
                                6

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in       C.C.No.1058/2012 of the ACJM Court,

Ernakulam and all further proceedings thereto.

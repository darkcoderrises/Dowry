                   B.A. No. 3071 of 2013
               -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 29th day of May, 2013

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.1223/2012

of the Chengannur Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498 A, 294(b) and

504 (ii) r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that

they    have   tortured     and     harassed      the  defacto

complainant, who is the wife of the first petitioner, and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry and

gold   ornaments,     after    misappropriating      her  gold

ornaments and money.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor. On perusal of the CD, it

has come out that crime has been registered on the basis

of a private complaint filed by the defacto complainant,

before    the  Judicial   First   Class     Magistrate  Court,

Chengannur, which was filed under Section 156(3) of

Cr.PC. Even though, there is an allegation of physical

harassment, any medical records are not available in the

B.A. No. 3071 of 2013
                                2

CD. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case

and the present stage of investigation, I do not think that

the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is required

for the further investigation of the case. Matters being

so, anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      4. In the result, this B.A. is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners arrest on each of them executing

a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five thousand

only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to

the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions.

      (1) The       petitioners  shall report     before the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

Wednesdays          and    Saturdays,  commencing       from

05.06.2013 for a period of three months or till the filing of

the final report in this case, which ever is earlier.

      (2) The petitioners shall not tamper with the

evidence or influence witnesses.

B.A. No. 3071 of 2013
                            3

      (3) The petitioners shall make themselves available

for   interrogation   as and    when   required   by   the

Investigating Officer.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

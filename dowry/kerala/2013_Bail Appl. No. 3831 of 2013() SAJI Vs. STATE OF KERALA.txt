                  -----------------------------------
           Dated this the 4th day of June, 2013


                             ORDER

     Petitioner's are 1st and 2nd accused in crime No.120/2013

of Kudiyanmala Police Station, registered for offences

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.     They have filed the above application

under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for

enlarging them on bail.

     2.    1st petitioner is the husband of one Beena, who

breathed her last on 05.05.2013 while undergoing treatment

in a hospital. 2nd petitioner is the father of the 1st petitioner.

The above crime was registered against petitioners and also

the mother of the 1st petitioner as 3rd accused, alleging that

on account of inhuman cruelty inflicted by them on Beena

torturing her demanding dowry even without providing food

to her for several days. She met with an untimely death. All

the three accused in the crime, it is stated, were arrested on

29.04.2012 and the 3rd accused, later, released on bail by

orders of the magistrate after she had undergone detention

for a few days. Petitioners too have moved application for

their release on bail but it was turned down by the Magistrate

and also learned Sessions Judge, and, hence they have come

 B.A.No.3831 of 2013              2




up before this Court with the above petition.

     3.     The defacto complainant in the crime, father of the

victim, got impleaded in the present proceedings to oppose

the request for bail by the aforesaid accused. I heard learned

counsel for petitioners, counsel for defacto complainant and

also learned Public Prosecutor. Case Diary has also been

produced for my perusal.

     4.     In view of the torture inflicted on Beena by accused

persons, she suffered severe injuries and was bedridden quite

for some time, and, even during that period she was denied

food by the accused persons is the allegation raised to show

the gravity of the matrimonial cruelty committed by the

accused which ultimately, allegedly caused death of the

victim. Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that the

victim had undergone treatment at several hospitals before

she was got admitted in Medical College Hospital, Manipur on

17.04.2013. She died of pneumonia and not on account of any

injures inflicted on her person is the further submission of the

counsel to contend that petitioners have no role in the death of

the victim. The victim was removed to hospital by neighbors

when she was totally left uncared by the accused persons after

 B.A.No.3831 of 2013             3




torturing her, is the submission of learned counsel for defacto

complainant, father of the victim. After perusing the Case

Diary I find no material disclosing as to who got the victim

admitted in different hospitals and also met the expenses for

her treatment. She had continuous treatment in several

hospitals at least for a month prior to her death is borne out

by the materials gathered.       These petitioners have been

undergoing pre-trial detention for more than one month.

Their continued detention for investigation is not called for.

They can be released on bail at this stage imposing adequate

conditions safeguarding the investigation of the crime.

      5. Petitioners are directed to be released on bail subject

to following conditions.

                1.   Petitioners shall execute a bond for

         Rs.25,000/- each with two solvent sureties for

         the like sum by each of them to the satisfaction

         of the Judicial First Class Magistrate -

         Thalipparamba.

                2.   Petitioners  shall  not   intimidate,

         terrorize or influence any of the witnesses

         connected with crime so as to dissuade them

B.A.No.3831 of 2013               4




        from speaking the truth before the Police or

        the Court as the case may be, nor shall they do

        any act or make any attempt to obliterate the

        evidence of the crime.

               3.   They    shall    report before   the

        investigating officer at the station, once in a

        week, on every Monday, at a time between 10

        A.M and 12 noon, for a period of 12 weeks or

        till completion of investigation of the crime,

        whichever is earlier.

               4.   Petitioners shall not leave the state

        without getting prior permission from the

        investigating officer in writing, for a period of

        six months from the date of their release.

               ------------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 02nd day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the 7th accused in C.C.No.38 of 2011 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Androth which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.18 of 2009

of Androth Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 427 & 448 read with Section 149 of

IPC with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2

Final Report in Crime No.18 of 2009 of Androth Police Station

and all further proceedings pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Androth in C.C.No.38 of 2011 as the

matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The petitioner is the 7th accused in Crime No.18 of

2009 of Androth Police Station, where the allegation is that he

along with other accused 30 in numbers threw stones and

sticks on the de facto complainant's house and caused

Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
                              :-2-:


damages on 16/04/2009 due to political animosity and thereby

committed the offeces punishable under Sections 143, 147,

148, 427 and 448 read with Section 149 of IPC. Now the case

of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court. The

de facto complainant is the 3rd respondent herein, who has

sworn into Annexure-A8 affidavit.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the respondents.      I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     5.    The learned counsel for the third respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
                             :-3-:


petitioner and he has no grievance against him.




     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A8 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 427 &

448 read with Section 149 of IPC which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.     It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 3rd respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto complainant has no further grievance against the

Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.1632 of 2013
                             :-6-:


the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime

No.18 of 2009 of Androth Police Station and all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.38 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Androth.

           Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 4th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

                   As the parties to the above M.C's are one and

same and especially when the above petitions are arouse out

of case and counter case and when the subject matters are

also same, the above two M.C are heard together and being

disposed by this common order.

         2.        Crl.M.C.No.2730/2013 is filed with a prayer

to quash proceeding in C.C.No795/2012 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala which is the case

instituted upon the report in Crime No.528/2012. The accused

therein are the petitioners in the above M.C and the second

respondent therein is the defacto complainant whereas

Crl.M.C.No.2731/2013 is filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

C.P.No.96/2012 pending before the           Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Varkala which is also instituted upon the

report in Crime No.515/2012 of Kallambalam Police Station.

The respondent in the above M.C is the defacto complainant in

the Crime No.515/2012 of Kallambalam Police Station who is

the accused in Crime No.528/2012 of same Police Station and

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
                                  2

the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.2730/2013. The subject matter of

the above two crime are arouse out of dispute with respect to

a pathway leading to the house of the accused in Crime

No.528/2012 who is the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.2730/2013.

In Crime No. 528/2012 the offences involved are under

Section 447, 294(b), 324, 308 and r/w Section 34 of IPC,

where as in Crime No.515/2012 the offences involved are

under Section 294(b), 324, 308, 447 and r/w Section 34 of

IPC. Now, both the counsel for the petitioners in the above

M.C's are submitted that the disputes between the parties are

settled out of Court and the defacto complainant in the above

cases are not interested in further prosecuting the matter.

According to the defacto complainant in Crime No.528/2012

sworn into an affidavit filed in Annexure-3 produced in

Crl.No.2730/2013, similarly the defacto complaint in Crime

No.515/2012 also filed Annexure-5 affidavit.

          4.         Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the respondents.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          5.         The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above crimes, the

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
                                   3

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the dispute

which is the subject matter of the above crimes. Therefore,

the continuation of the proceedings in the above crimes are

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          6.         The learned counsel for the respondents who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they

have no grievance against them.

          7.         I   have   carefully considered   the above

submissions of the respective counsel.        I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petitions. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also

no objection in allowing the above petitions.

          8.         Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in these cases, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above cases are only Sections 447, 294(b),

324, 308 and r/w Section 34 of IPC. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.       It is

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
                                     4

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the the

de facto complainants have no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
                                      5



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present cases and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present cases.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2730 & 2731 of 2013
                                  6

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.'s can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, these Crl.M.C's are allowed, quashing in

Crime Nos. 528/2012 & 515/2012            of Kallambalam Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

marriage between the 1st petitioner and the de facto

complainant was solemnised on 31.10.2007 and while the

de facto complainant was residing in her matrimonial

home, her gold ornaments were misappropriated and she

was subjected to harassment both physical and mental,

demanding more dowry and thus according to the

prosecution, the accused have committed the offences

punishable under sections 406, 498A, r/w 34 of IPC.

                   Crl.M.C No.2818 of 2011
            ------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 4th day of July, 2014.

                             O R D E R


         Aggrieved by the dismissal of the criminal revision by

the learned Sessions Judge, the respondent in M.C No.18/1994,

filed under Section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of

Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (in short 'the Act'), has come up

before this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. In spite

of serving notice on the first respondent, there was no

representation on her side. I have carefully perused the

impugned order.

     3.    Short facts, are as follows :

           Petitioner    married      the     first    respondent on

28-11-1991. A girl child was born in the relationship. The said

child was about 1 = years at the time of starting the legal battle.

It is alleged by the first respondent that she was given 15

sovereigns of gold ornaments by her father at the time of

Crl.M.C No.2818 of 2011           2




marriage. It is the case of the first respondent that after marriage,

the petitioner started treating her cruelly by demanding more

dowry and therefore their relationship became strained.

Thereafter, on 16-08-1993, the petitioner pronounced Talaq,

dissolving the marriage between him and the first respondent.

Then she approached the trial court with a case under Section 3

of the above mentioned Act.

      4.      The case had a chequered career. It was dismissed by

the trial court once and the order of the trial judge was reversed

in a revision by the Sessions Court. Thereafter, the case was

finally disposed only on 20-06-2009 by the trial court.

      5. Petitioner contended before the trial court that though

marriage between himself and the first respondent was admitted,

all her claims were without any basis. According to the

petitioner, the first respondent was an insane person. It was

impossible for him to live with her because of the insanity. He

Crl.M.C No.2818 of 2011           3




pronounced Talaq two times only for dissolving the marriage.

The petitioner was ready to take her back as wife. However, on

account of the attitude of the first respondent, it could not be

accomplished. The quantum of maintenance claimed by the first

respondent is disputed by the petitioner.

      6.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

trial court as well as the revisional court awarded exorbitant

amounts as maintenance in complete disregard of the paying

capacity of the petitioner. Petitioner was working as 'Moulavi' in

a Juma-ath. He had only a meagre income of Rs.550/- in the year

1994. At the time of evidence in 2000, his income was

Rs.1,200/- per month. Learned counsel submitted that the award

passed by the court below is disproportionately high.

      7.      I have carefully gone through the trial judgment and

the impugned judgment. The entire evidence has been described

in detail in the trial judgment. The courts below took note of the

Crl.M.C No.2818 of 2011          4




fact that for about 15 years, the divorce wife was engaged in

legal battle and till now she could not get any amount as

compensation          for fair and  reasonable   provision   and

maintenance. The claim was made in accordance with the cost of

living prevailing in the year 1994. By efflux of time, the cost of

living has gone up. It is also considered by the courts that the

petitioner had a steady increase in the income from his

avocation. The petitioner has no case that after he divorced the

first respondent in the year 1994, she had been remarried.

Admittedly, there is a girl child born in the relationship.

Therefore, considering all the facts and circumstances, I am of

the view that the court below has only awarded moderate

amounts towards the fair provision and maintenance and also for

maintenance during idda period. The maintenance awarded for

the child was only Rs.6,000/- . By no stretch of reasoning it can

be held that the amounts are exorbitant. Therefore, I find no

Crl.M.C No.2818 of 2011          5




reason to interfere in the findings in a jurisdiction of this Court

under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

      8.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

court below has awarded costs of Rs.5,000/- which is not

justifiable. Considering the entire facts and circumstances, I am

of the view that the costs awarded by the court below is slightly

excessive. Hence, it requires a slight modification.

              In the result, Crl.M.C is partly allowed. Costs

awarded by the court below as Rs.5,000/- in favour of the first

respondent is reduced to Rs.3,000/-. No other modification is

made in rest of the matters. With this observation, Crl.M.C is

disposed of.

      All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.

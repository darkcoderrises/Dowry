                  -----------------------------
                  B.A.No. 1206 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 5th day of March, 2013


                         O R D E R


     In this petition under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, the petitioner is the first accused in

Crime No.1091 of 2012 of the Pettah Police Station. It is

stated in the petition that the offences alleged are under

Sections 498 A and 494 of the Indian Penal Code and

Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The learned

Government Pleader would submit that the offences alleged

are only under Sections 498 A read with 34 of the Indian

Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition

Act.




     2. Apprehending arrest, detention and torture at the

hands of the Investigating Officer, this petition is filed

seeking an order to release the petitioner on bail in the

event of arrest, with a plea that the petitioner was falsely

implicated.

B.A.No. 1206 of 2013            2


     3.   The petitioner is the husband of the defacto

complainant.     Mother, sister and brother-in-law of the

petitioner are also arrayed as accused 2 to 4. All of them

together moved a similar petition as Crl.M.C.No.2592 of

2012 before the Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram. The

learned Sessions Judge while granting relief in favour of

accused 2 to 4, the relief sought for by the petitioner was

declined.    The petitioner is reported to be a Cardiac

Surgeon, recently joined in State service. The matrimonial

relationship was only for a few days or a few months. There

is nothing on record to show that the defacto complainant

had, in fact, sustained any bodily injury. No issues also. In

the above circumstance, I find that it would be appropriate

to grant relief to the petitioner also.




     In the result, this petition is allowed and there would

be an order directing the Investigating Officer to release

the petitioner also on bail on executing a bond for

B.A.No. 1206 of 2013          3


Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two

solvent sureties each for like amount to his satisfaction on

condition that the petitioner shall make available to the

Investigating Officer for interrogation as and when

required.




     It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that the petitioner is agreeable to settle the matrimonial

dispute.    The learned Government Pleader, after taking

instruction through the Investigating Officer would submit

that the defacto complainant is also willing to settle the

matter. Therefore, I find that this is a fit case to refer the

matrimonial dispute for mediation. Since the parties are

residing at Thiruvananthapuram, it is appropriate to direct

the Sessions Judge to refer the matrimonial dispute to the

District Mediation Centre.        Accordingly the learned

Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram is directed to refer the

dispute to the Mediation Centre. An additional copy of this

B.A.No. 1206 of 2013         4


order shall be sent to the Sessions Judge.      Possibly the

mediation shall be scheduled at 10.30 A.M., on 16-03-2012.

The petitioner shall appear before the Mediation Centre on

that day at that time. The Investigating Officer shall serve a

copy of this order with notice to the defacto complainant to

appear before the Mediation Centre at 10.30 A.M., on

16.03.2013.




                             P.S.GOPINATHAN,
                                    JUDGE.

              ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 15th day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused in C.C. No.18 of 2009 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Palakkad as well as

Criminal Appeal No.711 of 2010 of Sessions Court(Fast Track

No.I), Palakkad     which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.23/2009 of            Palakkad Town North

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Section 498A

r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the conviction and

sentence passed in C.C.No.18 of 2009 on the files of Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Palakkad(AnnexureA) which is now

pending in appeal as Criminal Appeal No.711 of 2010 on the

files of Sessions Court(Fast Track No.I), Palakkad and to quash

C.C. No.18 of 2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Palakkad as well as Criminal Appeal No.711 of 2010 of

Sessions Court(Fast Track No.I), Palakkad as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the

marriage between the accused No.1 and the defacto

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013         2

complainant was taken place on 13.07.2013 as per the Islamic

religious       ceremony.  After the marriage   the   de  facto

complainant was residing with her husband at her house at

Kodunthirappully. Accused No.2 and 3 are father and mother

of the accused No.1. According to the de facto complainant at

the time of marriage 40 sovereigns of gold ornaments were

given by her parents. Thereafter the accused misappropriated

the same and thus got difference of opinion among spouse

which ultimately lead to the registration of case against the

accused in Crime No.23/2009 in the Palakkad Town North

police station for the offences punishable under Section 498A

read with 34 of IPC. It is the further case of the petitioner

that the trial court, as per Annexure- A judgment dated

30.11.2010 in C.C.No.18/2009 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Palakkad, convicted the accused for the said

offences and imposed sentence on them and the accused

challenged the same by filing appeal ie., Crl.Appeal No. 711/10

and while the above appeal was pending in the court of

sessions (Fast Track No.1), Palakkad, the dispute between the

accused and de facto complainant has been settled out of court

and accordingly the de facto complainant who is the first

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013          3

respondent herein sworn into an affidavit dated 01.04.2013 in

support of Crl.M.A.No.2933 of 2013 which is a petition filed

under Section 482 read with Section 320(8) of Cr.P.C for

compounding the offence which is signed by all the accused as

well as the defacto complainant and counter signed by the

respective counsels.

            3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/s as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

            4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.               Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

            5. The learned counsel for the first respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

            6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013             4

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

            7.       Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Section 498A r/w 34 of IPC which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioner/s accused in the light of the settlement arrived

by them.           In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the

Honourable Apex Court, in the decision reported in Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-

                      "7.   It is  not   in   dispute that

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013                5

             matrimonial       disputes    have     been   on
             considerable      increase    in  recent    times
             resulting in filing of complaints under
             Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only
             against the husband but also against the
             relatives of the husband. The question is
             when such matters are resolved either by
             the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
             home or by mutual settlement of other
             pending disputes for which both the sides
             approached the High Court and jointly
             prayed      for   quashing    of   the   criminal
             proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the
             wife under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C.,
             whether the prayer can be declined on the
             sole ground that since the offences are non-
             compoundable under Section 320 of the
             Code, it would be impermissible for the
             court to quash the criminal proceedings or
             FIR or complaint.
                      8. It is not in dispute that in the case
             on hand subsequent to the filing of the
             criminal complaint under Sections 498A and
             406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the
             Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help
             and intervention of family members, friends
             and well-wishers, the parties concerned
             have amicably settled their differences and
             executed          a     compromise/settlement.
             Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the
             said compromise before the Trial Court with
             a request to place the same on record and
             to drop the criminal proceedings against the
             appellants herein. It is also not in dispute
             that in additional to the mutual settlement
             arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife
             has also filed an affidavit stating that she
             did not wish to pursue the criminal
             proceedings against the appellants and fully
             supported the contents of the settlement
             deed. It is the grievance of the appellants

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013             6

             that no only the Trial Court rejected such
             prayer of the parties but also the High
             Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction
             under Section 482 of the Code only on the
             ground that the criminal proceedings relate
             to the offences punishable under Sections
             498A and 406 of IPC which are non-
             compoundable in nature."
                      "12. In our view, it is the duty of the
             Courts to     encourage genuine settlements
             of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when
             the same are on considerable increase.
             Even if the offences are non-compoundable,
             if they relate to matrimonial disputes and
             the Court is satisfied that the parties have
             settled the same amicably and without any
             pressure, we hold that for the purpose of
             securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the
             Code would not be a bar to the exercise of
             power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
             subsequent criminal proceedings.
                        13. There has been an outburst of
             matrimonial disputes in recent times. The
             institution    of   marriage      occupies    an
             important place and it has an important
             role to play in the society. Therefore, every
             effort should be made in the interest of the
             individuals in order to enable them to settle
             down in life and live peacefully.        If the
             parties ponder over their defaults and
             terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
             agreement instead of fighting it out in a
             Court of law, in order to do complete justice
             in the matrimonial matters, the Courts
             should be less hesitant in exercising its
             extraordinary jurisdiction.       It is trite to
             state that the power under Section 482
             should be exercised sparingly and with
             circumspection only when the Court is
             convinced, on the basis of material on
             record, that allowing the proceedings to

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013          7

             continue would be an abuse of the process
             of the Court or that the ends of justice
             require that the proceedings ought to be
             quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case

as well.

            8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

Crl.M.C.No. 1539 of 2013          8

the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

            In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.

No.18 of 2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Palakkad as well as Criminal Appeal No.711 of 2010 of

Sessions Court(Fast Track No.I), Palakkad.

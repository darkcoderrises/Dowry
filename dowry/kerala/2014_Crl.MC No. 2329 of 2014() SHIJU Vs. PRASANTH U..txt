              ------------------------------------------------
                     Crl.M.C.No.2329 of 2014
              -------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 27th day of May, 2014

                                 ORDER

       This is an application filed by all the accused in C.P

No.75/2013(Crime No.546/2013 of Payyannur Police Station)

pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate, Payyannur on the

basis of the settlement u/s 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are arrayed as

accused numbers 1 to 8 in Crime No.546/2013 of Payyannur

Police Station alleging offences u/s 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324,

308 and 294(b) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. Crime was

registered on the basis of the statement given by the fourth

respondent as de facto complainant and after investigation final

report was filed and it is now pending as C.P No.75/2013. It is

also alleged in the petition that the petitioners in this case belong

to Bharathiya Janatha Party and respondents 1 to 9 belong to

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014             2



Communist Party of India (Marxist). On account of some political

enmity between them, some incident happened and both of them

sustained injuries. On the basis of the statement given by one of

the petitioners here, another crime was registered as Crime

No.544/2013 of Payyannur Police Station with respect to the same

incident and after investigation final report was filed in that case

also which was taken on file and since the matter has been settled

between the parties in Crime No.544/2013 of Payyannur Police

Station, the accused in that case filed Crl.M.C No.120/2014 before

this court and this court vide Annexure A III order quashed the

proceedings as against the accused persons in Crime No. 544/2013.

Now the matter in this case is also settled. No purpose will be

served on account of the settlement in proceeding with the case.

Since some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they

cannot file application before the court below. So the petitioners

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014                3



have no other remedy except to approach this court seeking the

following reliefs:




             i)   To quash Annexure AII final report in Crime
                  No. 546/2013 of Payyannur Police Station,
                  originally    was      numbered   as   C.P
                  No.75/2013 on the files of Judicial First
                  Class Magistrate, payyannur.
             ii)  To issue any other appropriate order or
                  direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit
                  in the interest of justice.


      3.    Respondents 1 to 9 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

the main case has been quashed by the court and they do not want

to prosecute the petitioners. They also filed Annexure IV Series

affidavits stating these facts.

      4. Learned counsel for petitioner also submitted that in view

of the settlement, conviction in this case is remote and so, he

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014             4



prayed for allowing the application.

      5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as directed by

this court, submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioners but opposed the application on the ground that it is a

political clash between the parties and if lenient view taken this is

likely to continue in future.

      4. Heard both sides.

      5. It is an admitted fact that petitioners belong to Bharathiya

Janatha Party and respondents 1 to 9 belong to Communist Party of

India(Marxist). It is also an admitted fact that on that fateful day

an incident happened in respect of which two crimes have been

registered namely Crime No.544/2013 against the respondents

herein alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324, 308 and 294(b) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and the

present crime Crime No.546/2013 against the present petitioners

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014            5



alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 308

and 294(b) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. It is also an

admitted fact that investigation was completed in both these cases

and final reports were filed and in respect of Crime No. 546/2013

which is the subject matter of this case, the case was taken on file

as C.P No.75/2013 and is now pending before Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Payyannur. It is also an admitted fact that the

respondents herein who were accused in Crime No. 544/2013 of

Payyannur Police Station which was registered in respect of the

same incident have moved this court as Crl.M.C No.120/2014 for

quashing the proceedings based on settlement and as per Annexure

AIII order this court has quashed proceedings against the

respondents herein. It is thereafter that the present petition has

been filed.

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014              6



      6. It is quite unfortunate that on account of the difference in

political ideology between these two group of political parties,

clashes are happening in the locality causing disturbance in the

mind of people. But, in this case it is seen that there is no other

case against the petitioners and the respondents as well. However,

such cases should not be encouraged by political parties at least in

future. Since the matter has been settled between the parties and

their difference of opinion has been resolved due to settlement and

the main case namely Crime.544/2013 of the same Police Station

registered against the respondents herein having been quashed by

this court, there is no purpose in keeping this case on file as

conviction in such cases is remote. If the parties can change their

mind and determine not to involve in criminal activities on the

basis of political ideology in future then this court will have to give

an opportunity to get themselves reformed as well.

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014               7



      7. I am not going into the question whether Section 308 of

Indian Penal Code will be attracted in this case or the allegations

are sufficient to attract that section etc. in this case. If peace can be

restored in the society on account of the settlement and further

such incidents can be avoided on account of the joint efforts taken

by the parties belonging to both political groups, then the

settlement has to be accepted and provide an opportunity to the

petitioners to lead a reformed life in future.

      8. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:


          "The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of
          the    High    Court    in   quashing     in   criminal
          proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
          the power given to a criminal court for
          compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
          statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014             8



          accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
          viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
          prevent abuse of the process of any Court.         In
          what     cases power    to  quash    the   criminal
          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
          where the offender and victim have settled their
          dispute    would   depend    on    the  facts    and
          circumstances of each case and no category can
          be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
          power, the High Court must have due regard to
          the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
          serious offences of mental depravity or offences
          like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
          quashed even though the victim or victim's family
          and the offender have settled the dispute. Such
          offences are not private in nature and have
          serious impact on society.          Similarly, any
          compromise between the victim and offender in
          relation to the offences under special statutes like
          Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
          committed by public servants while working in
          that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
          quashing criminal proceedings involving such
          offences.     But   the  criminal    cases   having
          overwhelmingly      and   pre-dominatingly       civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
          of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
          commercial,      financial,    mercantile,      civil,
          partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony relating to

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014              9



          dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong
          is basically private or personal in nature and the
          parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of case, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the
          compromise between the offender and victim, the
          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
          continuation of criminal case would put accused
          to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
          the criminal case despite full and complete
          settlement and compromise with the victim.       In
          other words, the High Court must consider
          whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
          interest of justice to continue with the criminal
          proceeding or continuation of the criminal
          proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process
          of law despite settlement and compromise between
          the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure
          the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
          case is put to end and if the answer to the above
          question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall
          be well within its jurisdiction to quash the
          criminal proceeding."




      9.   In the view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C Nos.2339/2014            10



between the parties and the main case namely Crime No.544/2013

of Payyannur Police Station which was registered in respect of the

same incident having been quashed by this court as per Annexure

AIII order and there is no possibility of conviction if the case is

allowed to continue in view of the settlement, this court feels that it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings as

keeping the case on file will amount to wastage of judicial time

and also with the hope that quashing of the case will give a

rethinking in the mind of the petitioners to reform themselves and

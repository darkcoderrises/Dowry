                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014
                   ..................................................
               Dated this the 8th day of April, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This petition is filed by accused 1 and 2 in C.C.No.1115/12

pending before the        Judicial        First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Vatakara to quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as defacto complaint,

a case was registered as Crime No.414/10 of Vatakara police

station  originally    against         several        persons        including the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 341 and

323 read with Section 149 of the Indian penal Code and after

investigation final report was filed and the case was originally

taken on file as C.C.No.710/2010.Except the present petitioners,

other accused persons faced trial and they were acquitted by

the learned Magistrate for want of identification. Thereafter the

case against the present petitioners have been spit up and

refiled as C.C.No.1155/12. Now the mater has been settled

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant and other

Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014               2

injured in the case. No purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case in view of the settlement. Conviction will be remote

in such cases. Since some of the offences are non compoundable

in nature, they could not file application before the concerned

court. So they have no other remedy except to approach this

court seeking the following relief:

         i. Quash Annexure 1 charge and final report, pending

         before the JFCM-I, Vatakara as C.C.No.1155/2012 against

         the petitioners. ii. Issue such other order or directions,

         which this    Hon'ble     court deem fit to pass in the

         circumstances of the case.

      3. Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the mater has been settled between the parties

and    they have no intention to proceed against the present

petitioners especially in the circumstances that other accused

were already acquitted by the court after evidence and they also

submitted that Annexures 2 and 3 affidavits stating these facts.

       4. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case. So they prayed for allowing the petition.

      5. The learned Public Prosecutor has, on instructions, as

Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014           3

per the direction of this Court submitted that there is no other

case against the petitioners       and     there is no    criminal

background and other accused persons were acquitted by the

court below after trial, but opposed the application on the

ground that        the present petitioners are absconding in the

matter.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent, a case was registered as

Crime No.414/10 of Vatakara police against the petitioners and

others alleging offences under Sections 143, 147,341 and 323

read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal         Code and after

investigation, final report was filed and it was  originally taken

on file as C.C.No.710/2010. Since the present petitioners did not

appear, the trial of the case was proceeded against other

accused persons and after trial they were acquitted by the

learned Magistrate. The case agaisnt the petitioners has been

split up and refiled as C.C.No.1155/12 and pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Vatakara. Now the matter

has been settled by the petitioners with the defacto complainant

and the other injured and they have filed Annexures 2 and 3

affidavits   stating these facts.   Considering the fact that the

Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014                4

matter has been settled between the parties and                    they are

neighbours and harmony has been restored between them on

account of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and conviction in such cases will be

remote as the prosecution witness will not support the case of

the prosecution.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

           "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

           arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

           partnership or such like transactions or the offences

           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

           may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

           of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

           continuation of criminal case would put accused to

           great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014                 5

           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

           case   despite    full and   complete    settlement  and

           compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

           Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

           contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

           criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

           proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

           law despite settlement and compromise between the

           victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

           of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

           an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

           affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

           jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      8.In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the petitioners and

respondents 2 and 3 who are the defacto complainant and the

injured in the case are neighbours and the mater has been

settled due to intervention of mediators and friends                 and their

relationship has been restored, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and it will be only a wastage of judicial

time, this Court feels that it is a case where power under Section

482 has to be invoked to quash the proceedings as against the

Crl.M.C.No.2046 of 2014            6

petitioners in order to promote the settlement which restored

their relationship.

      So, the petition is allowed     and further proceedings in

C.C.No.1155/2012 (Crime No.414/2010 of Vatakara police

station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court

-I, Vatakara, as against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for further action in this regard.

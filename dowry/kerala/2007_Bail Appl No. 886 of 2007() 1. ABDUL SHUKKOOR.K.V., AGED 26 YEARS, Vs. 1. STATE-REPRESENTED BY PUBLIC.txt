                - - - - - - - - - ----------------------- - - - - - -

             DATED THIS THE 14TH  DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2007


                                      O R D E R


       Petitioner who is the first accused in Cr.No.49/07 of Taliparamba


Police Station for an offence punishable under section 498A read with


section 34 IPC, seeks anticipatory bail.


       2.      The   marriage   between   the   petitioner   and   the   de   facto


complainant Jameela was on 17.8.2006.  She soon left the matrimonial


home alleging that her husband and in-laws subjecting her to mental


and physical cruelty on frequent demands for further amounts towards


dowry.


       3.      Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of this nature.


But   at   the   same   time,     I   am   inclined   to   permit   the   petitioner     to


surrender before the Investigating Officer for interrogation and then to


have   his   application   for   bail  ordered   by  the   Magistrate.    Accordingly,


the   petitioner   shall   surrender   before   the   Investigating  Officer   on  any


day   between   19.2.2007   and   21.2.2007   for   the   purpose   of


interrogation.  The petitioner shall thereafter be produced on the same


day   before   the   Magistrate   having   jurisdiction   who   shall   release   the


petitioner on bail on appropriate conditions.


       This application is disposed of as above.





                                                           V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE

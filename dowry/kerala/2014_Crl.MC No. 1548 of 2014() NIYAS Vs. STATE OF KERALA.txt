                    .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.1548 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 14th day of March, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 3 in

C.C.No.807/2012 on           the file of the Judicial                 First Class

Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode to quash the proceedings on

the basis of a compromise under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are the

accused in C.C.No.807/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode which was originated on the

basis of Crime No.475/2012 of Nadakkavu police station,

Kozhikode district on the basis of a statement given by the

second respondent as the defacto complainant alleging the

offences under Sections 323, 341 and 427 read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, Annexure-A1 final

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.807/2012 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV,

Kozhikode. Since they did not appear, non bailable warrant has

been issued against them and it is pending. Now the matter has

Crl.M.C.No.1548 of 2014               2

been settled between the parties, no purpose will be served in

proceeding with the case.           Since non bailable warrant       is

pending against them, apprehending that compounding will

not be possible before the concerned Magistrate court, they

have no other option but to approach this Court seeking the

following relief:



        For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of
        hearing it is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court
        be pleased to quash all further proceedings against the
        petitioners/accused pursuant to Annexure A1 charge sheet
        in  CC 807/2012 on the files     of  Judicial First   Class
        Magistrate    Court-IV, Kozhikode in Crime No.475/2012 of
        Nadakkavu     police station in Kozhikode  District, in the
        interest of justice.



      3. The second respondent appeared            through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

due to intervention of mediators and he has no objection in

quashing the proceedings against the petitioners. The counsel

for the petitioners also submitted that in view of the settlement,

no purpose will be served in proceeding with the case.

      4. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor, on

instructions, submitted that though there is no other case

against the petitioners, the petitioners have created a fearsome

Crl.M.C.No.1548 of 2014          3

situation as well while committing the offence and opposed the

application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a statement

given by the second         respondent   Crime No.475/2012 of

Nadakkavu police       station  was    registered   against   the

petitioners alleging the offence under Sections 323, 341 and

427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed and the case

was taken on file as C.C.No.807/2012 and pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikdoe. It is

submitted by the      counsel for the petitioners that  since the

petitioners could not appear before the court below, non

bailable warrant has been issued against them and it is pending.

It is also seen from Annexure A2 affidavit that the matter has

been settled between the petitioners and the second respondent

and due to intervention of mediators, harmony has been restored

between them. On going through the nature of the offences

alleged also, no serious injuries    have    been inflicted. The

petitioners have no other criminal background as well.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

Crl.M.C.No.1548 of 2014               4

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
          pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
          the offences arising from commercial, financial
          mercantile,    civil,  partnership    or   such   like
          transactions    or   the  offences   arising  out   of
          matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family
          disputes where the wrong is basically private or
          personal in nature and the parties have resolved
          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because of the compromise between the offender
          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
          quashing the criminal case despite full and
          complete settlement and compromise with the
          victim.   In other words, the High Court must
          consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to
          the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
          proceedings    or    continuation  of   the  criminal
          proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process
          of law despite settlement and compromise between
          the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure
          the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
          case is put to an end and if the answer to the above
          question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
          well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
          proceeding."



      7. So considering the circumstances and also the dictum

laid down in the above decision and also considering the fact

that no purpose will be served in allowing the prosecution to

continue in view of the settlement, this Court feels that the

power under Section 482 can be invoked to quash                proceedings

to promote harmony that has been restored on account of the

Crl.M.C.No.1548 of 2014            5

settlement.   Therefore, this petition is       allowed and further

proceedings     in   C.C.No.807/2012     (Crime     No.475/2012  of

Nadakkavu police station, Kozhikode district) pending before

the   Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode as

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

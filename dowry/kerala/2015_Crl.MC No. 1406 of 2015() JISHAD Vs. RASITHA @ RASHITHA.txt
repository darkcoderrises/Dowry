           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners         are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.873/2014 of Cheruthuruthy Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of

the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A1            FIR      in    Crime       No.873/2014     of

Cheruthuruthy Police Station as against the petitioners and

all further proceedings based on it pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Wadakkanchery,

quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

                               : 2 :



is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more     dowry,   after  misappropriating   her   entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.     The  defacto    complainant,   who   is   the    1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners   and,   therefore,  all   further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

counsel.

Crl.M.C.1406/2015
                                : 3 :



      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

FIR in Crime No.873/2014 of Cheruthuruthy Police Station

as against the petitioners and all further proceedings based

on it pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, Wadakkanchery are hereby quashed.

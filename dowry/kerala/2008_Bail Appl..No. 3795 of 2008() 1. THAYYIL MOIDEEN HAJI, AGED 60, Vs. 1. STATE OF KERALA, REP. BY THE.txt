        Application for anticipatory bail.

        2. Petitioners are implicated for offences under sections 498A read

with section 34 IPC. First accused is the husband of the defacto-

complainant and petitioners 1 to 5 are the close relatives of the 1st accused.

They allegedly harassed the defacto-complainant on the date of the marriage

itself demanding dowry, is the allegation. The learned counsel for the

petitioner submitted that on the date of the marriage itself the defacto-

complainant started exhibiting some mental abnormality in behaviour and

she was taken to doctor. A medical certificate is also handed over for

perusal. The marriage was on 15-5-2008 and the complaint is filed on 2-6-

2008, within few days of the date of the marriage. The 1st accused is granted

bail.

        3. On hearing both sides I find that the anticipatory bail can be

granted to the petitioners and the following order is passed:-

          Petitioners shall be released on bail in the event of

          their arrest on their executing                              a bond for

          Rs.25,000/- each with solvent sureties each for the

 BA 3795/08                          -2-

        like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting

        officer on condition that they will appear before

        the Investigating Officer as and when directed by

        him and shall co-operate with the investigation.

      The application is allowed as above.



                                              K. HEMA,
                                              JUDGE.

          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 4th day of March, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

accused    in     L.P.No.62/2001                   (Crime          No.286/1995       of

Payangadi Police Station) to quash the proceedings on the

basis of the settlement arrived at between the petitioner

and the defacto-complainant under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the present

petitioner is the 4th accused in Crime No.286/1995 of

Payangadi Police Station, registered on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, as defacto-

complainant along with three other accused persons,

alleging offences under Section 323 read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.                 All other accused persons were

tried and acquitted by the court, as per orders in

C.C.No.807/1995           and         C.C.No.505/2008.                    The   present

Crl. M.C. No.1277 of 2014
                                   2

petitioner is the only accused now left out in that crime. In

the previous cases also, none of the witnesses supported the

case of the prosecution. Now the matter has been settled

between the petitioner and the defacto-complainant. The

defacto-complainant filed Annexure-A3 affidavit. Since he

was working outside Kerala, he could not appear and

participate in the proceedings and now the case has been

transferred to the register of long pending cases and

pending as L.P.No.62/2001.          Since the matter has been

settled between the parties, there is no possibility of any

conviction being entered into against the petitioner. Further

even in the earlier proceedings, no acceptable evidence has

been adduced to prove the case of the prosecution. So, the

petitioner has no other remedy, except to file this petition

before this court, seeking the following relief:

             "For these and other grounds that may be urged at
      the time of hearing, it is most humbly prayed that this
      Hon'ble court may be pleased to quash the entire
      proceedings in L.P.C.No.62/2001 (pursuant to Crime
      No.286/1995 of Payangadi Police Station) pending on the
      file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur
      against the petitioner, so as to secure the ends of
      justice."

                                 3

            3.    2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and he has filed Annexure-A3 affidavit regarding

the same.

            4.    Learned Public prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioner and the case against other accused

persons have been tried and ended in acquittal, but opposed

this application, on the ground that he was absconding after

the incident.

            5.    The counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

since no purpose will be served by allowing the case to

proceed with, he prayed for allowing the application.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the additional 2nd respondent, a case

was registered as Crime No.286/1995 of Payangadi Police

Station, against four accused persons, including the

petitioner, alleging offence under Section 323 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and after investigation,

Crl. M.C. No.1277 of 2014
                             4

Annexure-A1 final report was filed and it was originally

taken on file as C.C.807/1995 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, and original accused

Nos.1 and 3 were tried and they were acquitted by the

court, as per Annexure-A2 order and the case against the

original accused Nos.2 and 4 including the present

petitioner was split up and re-filed as C.C.No.106/2000.

Thereafter the 2nd accused also appeared and case against

him was refiled as C.C.No.166/2000 and that was also

ended in acquittal. The present petitioner is the only left out

of the accused in that case. He was absconding through

out. The Public prosecutor had submitted that, there is no

other case against the petitioner.     Further a perusal of

Annexure-A2 judgment will go to show that none of the

witnesses have supported the case of the prosecution and

all of them were declared hostile and the examination of

official witnesses were dispensed with and the judgment

was pronounced, acquitting accused Nos.1 and 3 in that

crime. Now the matter has been settled between the

Crl. M.C. No.1277 of 2014
                                      5

parties, the defacto-complainant has filed Annexure-A3

affidavit stating that, the matter has been settled and he

has no grievance against the petitioner. Merely because

the petitioner is absconding, is not a ground not invoke the

Section 482 of the 'Code', if there is no purpose will be

served in retaining the case. Further it is seen from the

documents produced that, even cases in which other

accused persons were tried, the prosecution witnesses did

not support the case of the prosecution and they were

acquitted. So, no purpose will be served in retaining this

case, in view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties.

            7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is stated

that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with

Crl. M.C. No.1277 of 2014
                                       6

      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, the case against

Crl. M.C. No.1277 of 2014
                                  7

the accused persons were ended in acquittal due to non-

support from the prosecution witnesses and the matter has

been settled between the present accused and the defacto-

complainant, this court feels that no purpose will be served

by retaining the case and allowing the prosecution to

continue will only amount to wastage of judicial time and it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

`Code' can be invoked and the case has to be quashed. So

the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

L.P.C.No.62/2001 (Crime No.286/1995 of Payangadi Police

Station) on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannur, against the petitioner is quashed. Office

is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

magistrate court for further necessary action.

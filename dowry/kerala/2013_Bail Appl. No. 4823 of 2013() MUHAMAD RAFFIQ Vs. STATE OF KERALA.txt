             Dated this the 11th day of July, 2013


                                ORDER


      Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.762 of 2013 of

Pooyappally Police Station registered for offences punishable

under Section 498(A) r/w. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

He has filed the above application seeking pre-arrest bail under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short "the

Code").

      2. The above crime was registered against petitioner and

three others, his parents and his sister, on a complaint filed by his

wife before the magistrate, and that being referred to police for

investigation and report, imputing matrimonial cruelty and

harassment demanding dowry. Other accused in the crime A2 to

A4, it is stated, had been granted pre-arrest bail by orders passed

by this court.     Petitioner is employed in a gulf country and,

previously, he could not move for the discretionary relief, is the

submission of his counsel.         He is prepared to abide by any

condition imposed by this court and he will also co-operate with

investigation, is the further submission to urge for granting the

relief canvassed.      Opposing the application learned Public

B.A.No.4823 of 2013
                                 2

Prosecutor submits that very grave allegations are raised

against petitioner in the complaint by his wife, and

investigation so far conducted has revealed his complicity in

the offence imputed.

     After hearing the submissions made and taking note of

the facts and circumstances presented, I find petitioner can be

granted the relief of pre-arrest bail imposing conditions

safeguarding smooth completion of investigation of the crime.

          i. Petitioner is directed to report before the

    investigating officer at 10.00.a.m.on 16.07.2013 and on

    such appearance, after his interrogation, in the event of

    his arrest in the crime, he is directed to be released on

    bail on his executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees

    Fifteen thousand only) with one solvent surety for the like

    sum.

          ii. He shall report before the investigating officer,

    later also, if his presence is demanded for the smooth

    completion of investigation of the crime.

          iii. He shall surrender his passport before the

    investigating officer, who shall then produce the same

    before court. It is open to petitioner to seek release of

    passport from the court if he has any sustainable ground

    to do so, and any such application, if moved, shall be

    considered and disposed by magistrate on its merits in

    accordance with law.

          iv. Petitioner shall not induce, influence or

    intimidate any person acquainted with the facts of the

B.A.No.4823 of 2013
                                 3

    case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts

    before the police or the court, as the case may be, and nor

    shall he do any act or make any attempt to obliterate

    evidence of the crime.

     In default of his appearance before the investigating

officer on the date and time fixed as above, and also

non-compliance of the direction issued above over the

production of passport, this order shall cease to have any

effect.

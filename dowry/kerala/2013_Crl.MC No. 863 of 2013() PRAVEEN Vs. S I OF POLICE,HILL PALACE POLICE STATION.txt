                 Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                          ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.1725/2007 of the

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam which is

a case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Sections 363 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C., with a

prayer to quash Annexure B final report filed against the

petitioners by S.I. Of Police Hill palace Police Station in

C.C.No.1725 /2007 pending before the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Ernakulam as the matter is settled out of

court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that on

14/10/2006 at about 10 hrs, the petitioners with a common

intention kidnapped three minor children from the law full

custody    of   their   parents   in   a   car    bearing   Re.

No.KL.7.A.AR.6778.      The    Sub    Inspector    of    Police,

Udayamperoor while on patrol duty found the accused along

with minor children. The minor children are namely Sangeetha,

aged 16 years, D/o. Balakrishnamenon, Saranya, aged 17

Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
                                 2

years, D/o. Unnikrishnan and Anjali, aged 16 years, D/o.

Rajasekharan. At the time of incident they were studying in

plus two class in N.S.S. College, Thripunithura. Thus according

to the prosecution the accused 4 in numbers have committed

the offences punishable under Section 363 r/w Section 34 of

I.P.C. Now the case of the petitioners is that during the

pendency of the above case the entire matter is settled with

the defacto complainant who is CW1 and other victim of the

crime. Accordingly, CW1 namely Saranya who is the defacto

complainant sworn into an affidavit dated 11/2/2013 by which

she has specifically stated that subsequent the incident she

was married by the second petitioner and now they are leading

a peaceful marital life. Similarly CW2, namely AnjaliRaj sworn

into affidavit an affidavit dated 3/9/2013, she has also stated

that about the settlement arrived and about the marriage

between second petitioner CW1. CW3, namely Sangeetha who

had also sworn into an affidavit dated 4/9/2013.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
                                3

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.           Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and they has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 363 r/w Section 34 of

I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no public

Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
                                    4

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioners accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
                                       5

           be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

           stand on different footing for the purposes of

           quashing, particularly the offences arising from

           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

           or such like transactions or the offences arising out

           of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

           disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved

           their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

           because of the compromise between the offender

           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

           and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

           put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

           quashing the criminal case despite          full and

           complete settlement and compromise with the

           victim........"

           According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

Crl.M.C.No.863 of 2013
                                6

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-B and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.1725/2007 of the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Ernakulam.

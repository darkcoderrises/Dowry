                      B.KEMAL PASHA, J.
               ============================
                       B.A. No. 293 of 2015
              =============================
             Dated this the 2nd day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R

      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioner is the 2nd accused in Crime No.20 of

2015 of the Nedumkandam Police Station, registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 120B, 420, 494 and 498A

read with Section 34 IPC.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

along with the 1st accused, who is his son, hatched a criminal

conspiracy to solemnize the marriage of the 1st accused with

the defacto complainant, by suppressing the then subsisting

marriage of the 1st accused with another woman. It is alleged

that after the marriage, she was tortured and harassed by the

petitioner and the other accused by demanding more dowry,

after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

B.A. No.293 of 2015           2




      4.      Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the CD.

      5.    Even though the name of the person is shown as

the wife of the 1st accused and it has been averred that the 1st

accused had married that lady earlier, no evidence has been

collected to show any such first marriage. The case records

do not prima facie reveal the complicity of the petitioner in any

such incident. Of course, there are allegations that he had

also participated in harassing the defacto complainant by

demanding more dowry. The petitioner is a 72 year old man.

All the main overt acts are alleged against the 1st accused.

Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the

present stage of the investigation, I do not think that the

custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required for the

continued investigation of this case. This is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

B.A. No.293 of 2015              3




conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his executing

a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only)

with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to the

following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00     a.m.  on     all Mondays      and Thursdays

     commencing from 09.02.2015 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.

           (ii)   The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (iii) The    petitioner    shall   make      himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

B.A. No.293 of 2015             4




            (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

      offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

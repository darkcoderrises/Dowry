                        -------------------------------
                        Crl.M.C.No.4489 of 2014
                        -------------------------------
               Dated this the 11th day of August, 2014.


                                O R D E R

            The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is accused in Crime No. 713/2011 of Viyyoor

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 and

294(b) of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR in Crime

No.713/2011 of Viyyoor Police Station as the matter is settled out of

court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that petitioner is the

husband of 1st respondent and on 22.07.2011 at 10:30 hours at their

residential house, the petitioner being infuriated by the attitude of the

1st respondent in questioning the conduct of the petitioner in not

bringing the salary to their house, assaulted the 1st respondent and thus

committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the petitioner is

that the matter is settled out of court.

Crl.M.C.No.4489 of 2014
                                     2



          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the 1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above crime.          Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis

of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the

above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioner and she has no grievance

against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

under Sections 341, 323 and 294(b) of IPC, which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.     The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
          in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
          from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
          the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
          wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
          exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
          power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
          abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
          dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
          case and no category can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C.No.4489 of 2014
                                            4



It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
           from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
           such like transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
           where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
           and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
           is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
           put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
           injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite      full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in

the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out

of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have

any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings.             Thus, according to me, following the

                                       5



decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure - A1 FIR

and all further proceedings pending against the petitioner in Crime No.

713/2011 of Viyyoor Police Station.

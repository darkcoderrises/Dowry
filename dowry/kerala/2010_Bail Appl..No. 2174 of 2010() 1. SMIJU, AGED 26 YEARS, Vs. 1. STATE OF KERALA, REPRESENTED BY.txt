          Bail Application No.2174 of 2010
              ---------------------------------------
        Dated this the 20th day of April, 2010

                          O R D E R

        Petitioners who seek pre-arrest bail are accused in

Crime No.346 of 2010 of Kodungallur Police Station in

which the offence involved are 341, 323, 498 A and 315 r/w

34 I.P.C.

      2.   The 1st petitioner is the husband of the victim.

The allegation against the petitioners is that connected with

demand for dowry, there was frequent quarrel and the

victim was subjected to harassment, both mentally and

physically.   The defacto complainant at the time of the

incident was 3 months pregnant.               According to the

prosecution, on 14.03.2010 at about 4.45 p.m, the 1st

petitioner beat on the victim's cheeks forcibly and thereby

the pinna of her ear was detached and she was also kicked

and stamped.       The specific allegation against the 1st

petitioner is that when the victim fell on the ground, the 1st

petitioner by sitting on her abdomen pressed on her neck

and when she cried, the neighbours rushed to the spot and

only thereafter the 1st petitioner released the victim from his

                                 -:2:-

clutches. The allegation is very serious as far as the 1st

petitioner is concerned.        Going by the allegation, no

serious overt act is alleged against the 2nd and 3rd

petitioners, who are accused 2 and 3.

       3.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, I am of the view that the allegation

against the 1st accused/1st petitioner is very serious and

therefore I am not inclined to allow the petition in favour of

the 1st petitioner, whereas against petitioners 2 and 3, who

are accused 2 and 3, there is no overt act. Therefore I am of

the view that the prayer in favour of petitioners 2 and 3 can

be allowed.

       4.    In the result, the prayer for anticipatory bail with

respect to the 1st petitioner is rejected. Whereas the prayer

for anticipatory bail with respect to petitioners 2 and 3 is

allowed. Accordingly, a direction is issued to the officer-in-

charge of the police station concerned to release the

petitioners 2 and 3 on bail for a period of one month in the

event of their arrest in connection with the above case on

each of them executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees

Twenty Five Thousand only)         with two solvent sureties

each for the like amount to the satisfaction to the said

officer and subject to the following conditions:




            1. Petitioners 2 and 3 shall report before the
               Investigating Officer between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
               on all Wednesdays.

            2. Petitioners 2 and 3 shall make        themselves
               available for interrogation as and when required
               by the Investigating Officer.

            3. Petitioners 2 and 3 shall not influence or
               intimidate the prosecution witnesses nor shall
               they attempt to tamper with the evidence for
               the prosecution.

            4. Petitioners 2 and 3 shall not commit any offence
               while on bail.

            5. Petitioners 2 and 3 shall surrender before the
               Magistrate concerned and seek regular bail in
               the meanwhile.

       If petitioners 2 and 3 commit breach of any of the

above conditions, the bail granted to them shall be

liable to be cancelled.

            This application is allowed in part as above.

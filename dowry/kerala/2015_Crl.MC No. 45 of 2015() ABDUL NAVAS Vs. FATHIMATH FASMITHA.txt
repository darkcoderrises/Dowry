                     CRL. M.C. No.45 of 2015
           ...............................................................
             Dated this the 3rd day of January, 2015

     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.779/2012 of the

Vidya Nagar Police Station, Kasaragod registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 final report in

the said Crime presently pending as C.C.238/2014 before

the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more

CRL.M.C.No.45 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,    who   is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.No.45 of 2015
                               -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

final report in Crime No.779/2012 of Vidya Nagar Police

Station, Kasaragod and all further proceedings based on it

in   C.C.238/2014     pending     before   the   Chief Judicial

Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, are hereby quashed.

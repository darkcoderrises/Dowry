                 ================
                   B.A. No. 603 of 2015
           =======================
           Dated this the 4th day of February, 2015

                        O R D E R


     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioner is the        first accused in Crime

No.1307/2014 of Mattannur Police Station registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 325 and 420

read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.   The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty, by

demanding more dowry, after misappropriating her entire

gold ornaments and money. It is alleged that by making a

false representation that he would keep her gold ornaments

in  locker,   he   obtained     her   gold   ornaments    and

misappropriated it, thereby cheating and defrauding the de

facto complainant.    It is also alleged that the petitioner is

keeping a concubine and when he was caught red-handed

by the de facto complainant and her father from the house

 B.A. No. 603 of 2015
                                2

of the concubine on 06.04.2014, he severely attacked the de

facto complainant and her father.      Her father was severely

beaten up and he suffered a grievous hurt also.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     The contents of the C.D. prima facie reveal the

complicity of the petitioner. The wound certificate of the

father of the de facto complainant which finds a place

among the records in the C.D. clearly reveals the series of

injuries sustained by the father of the de facto complainant .

The allegations against the petitioner are very grave and

serious.        Considering the seiousness of the allegation

against     the    petitioner, and   the   present   stage  of

investigation, I am satisfied that the petitioner is not

entitled to the discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

      The learned counsel for the petitioner seeks for an

opportunity to the petitioner to surrender before the

investigating       officer and  to    co-operate    with  the

 B.A. No. 603 of 2015
                                 3

investigation.

      In the result, this bail application is dismissed. At the

same time, if so advised, the petitioner may surrender

before the investigating officer within ten days from today

and in such case, the investigating officer can interrogate

the petitioner, effect recovery if any, and conduct the

investigation and produce the petitioner without delay

before the concerned Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, where the petitioner can move for bail. In such case,

the learned Magistrate shall pass appropriate orders,

preferably on the same day itself, provided advance notice

on such application has been given to the Assistant Public

Prosecutor also.

         -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                                    O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioners who are accused Nos. 1 to 6 in C.C.No.21/2011

on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Manjeri, to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that the

petitioners were arrayed as accused Nos. 1 to 6 in

C.C.No.21/2011           pending            before          the        Chief      Judicial

Magistrate Court, Manjeri, which originated on the basis of

Crime No.638/2010 of Manjeri police station, which was

registered on the receipt of a private complaint filed by the

defacto-complainant namely, the 2nd respondent herein

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court- Manjeri, which

was forwarded to the police for investigation under Section

156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.                                           After

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                              2

investigation final report was filed which was taken on file

as C.C.No.21/2011 and that is pending before the Chief

Judicial magistrate, Manjeri. In the mean time government

had accorded sanction to withdraw the prosecution under

Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the

application filed by the Deputy Director of Prosecution for

permission to withdraw the case was dismissed by the

learned magistrate and that was challenged by the

petitioner before this court by filing Crl. M.C.No.4785/2013.

In the meantime, the matter has been settled between the

parties. So he withdrew that petition with liberty to move

fresh petition and accordingly, Crl.M.C.No.4785/2013 was

dismissed as not pressed.        Subsequently, the present

petition has been filed on the ground of settlement. The

parties have now settled the claim. There is no possibility

of conviction on account of the settlement. Since some of

the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could

not file an application before the court concerned for

compounding, so the petitioners have no other remedy,

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                  3

except to approach this court, seeking the following relief:

            "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble court
      be pleased to quash all further proceedings against the
      petitioners/accused in CC No.21/2011 on the files of
      Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri, pursuant to
      Annexurew-A1 FIR and charge sheet in crime no.
      638/2010 of Manjeri police station in the interest of
      justice".

            3.     2nd  respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and he does not want to prosecute the

petitioners on account of the settlement. He filed Annexure-

A3 affidavit stating these facts.

            4.     The counsel for the petitioner also submitted

that in view of the settlement no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and so he prayed for allowing the

application.

            5.     Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this court, submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioners but opposed the application.

            6.     It is an admitted fact that on the date of

incident, some miscreants, who were taking part of the

procession in connection with the Grama Panchayath

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                 4

Election have caused some mess when it reached in front of

the house of the defacto-complainant and some damage has

been caused to the jeep of the petitioner. Though he made

complaint to the police, no case was registered and

subsequently, he filed a private complaint before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, which was forwarded to the

police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure and on that basis Crime No.638/2010 of

Manjeri police station was registered, alleging offences

under Section 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 427 read with

Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

            7.     After investigation final report was filed

against the present petitioners and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.21/2011 and it is pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Manjeri. It is also an admitted fact that

Government has accorded sanction for withdrawal of the

prosecution and the Deputy Director of Prosecution of that

court filed Crl.M.P.No.3698/2013 seeking permission to

withdraw the prosecution under Section 321 of the Code of

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                5

Criminal Procedure. But that petition was dismissed by the

court below and they challenged the same by filing

Crl.M.C.No.4785/2013 before this court, but in the

meantime the matter has been settled between the parties

and that petition was not pressed with liberty to proceed

with the application for quashing on the basis of settlement.

That is how the present petition has been filed.

            8.     Now the 2nd respondent, who is the defacto-

complainant appeared through counsel and submitted that,

due to the intervention of mediators, the matter has been

settled and he does not want to prosecute the petitioners.

On account of the settlement, he filed Annnexure-A3

affidavit stating these facts. It appears to be a private

dispute, though some of the political party members have

been involved in the damage caused to the vehicle

belonging to the petitioner. However, it has been settled

between the parties. No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as they will not support the case

of the prosecution and conviction in such cases will be

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                   6

remote. It is a private dispute, which resulted in the filing

of a private complaint and registering of crime and filing of

final report, which has now been settled harmony has been

restored between the parties.

            9.     Further in the decision reported in Gian

Singh V. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                    7

      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
      its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

            10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and it is a private dispute

which has been resulted in filing of a private complaint and

registering the crime and in view of the settlement, no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case as the

conviction in such cases will be remote, this court feels that,

Crl. M.C.2870 of 2014
                                 8

it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash the

proceedings, in order to promote settlement, which resulted

in harmony between the petitioners and the defacto-

complainant.

            So the application is allowed and further

proceedings in C.C. No. 21/2011 (Crime No.638/2010 of

Manjeri Police Station) pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court,       Manjeri, as against the petitioner is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to

the concerned court, immediately.

            With     the above    observation, this     criminal

miscellaneous case is disposed of.

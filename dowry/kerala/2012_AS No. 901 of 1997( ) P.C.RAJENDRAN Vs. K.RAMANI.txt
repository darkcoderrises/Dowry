                -----------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 1st day of March 2012


                              J U D G M E N T


Hema. J.


      This appeal is filed against decree and Judgment passed in

favour of respondent by the Sub Court in a suit for recovery of

gold or its value.

      2. Respondents herein (parties will be referred to as referred

in the suit herein after) filed a suit before the Sub Court inter alia

contending that marriage between first plaintiff and first

defendant (first appellant) took place on 1.7.1993. Before the

marriage, there was an agreement to pay `15,000/- and 25

sovereigns of gold ornaments as dowry. On 9.6.1993 at about 11

am `15000/- was paid as agreed and at the time of marriage, 25

sovereigns of gold was also given to first plaintiff.

      3. There was difference of opinion between the couple and

first plaintiff alleged that she was treated with cruelty and she was

forced to leave the house on 16.12.1993 along with the mother

who came to the house pursuant to a letter, Ext.A1 sent by first

AS. 901/97                         -2-

plaintiff to the second plaintiff, who is her mother. She left the

house by wearing only 'thali chain'.      The gold ornaments and

`15,000/- received as dowry were not returned to the plaintiff.

O.P.60/1994 was filed by first plaintiff before the Sub Court

seeking divorce against defendant no.1.        Decree was granted

dissolving the marriage.         No appeal was filed.     In such

circumstances, the suit was filed for realisation of `15,000/- and

25 sovereigns of gold ornaments or its value @`92,400/- for 200

grams of gold with 12 % interest par annum.

      4. The defendants-appellants filed joint written statement

and admitted the marriage and also payment of `15,000/- to the

defendants. But according to the defendants, the said amount

was repaid and an agreement was prepared for that purpose but it

was torn off but it was produced before the court in the divorce

petition after re-fixing the same. It is not received as dowry, but

as advance. According to defendants, 25 sovereigns of gold were

not given to the first plaintiff and what ever gold ornaments in her

possession were taken away when she left the house along with

her cousin Sri.Preman.

      5. One gold ring and Thali and chain were given to the first

AS. 901/97                       -3-

plaintiff at the time of marriage and those were also taken away.

Defendants are therefore not liable to return gold ornaments or

its value. It is also contended that first plaintiff did not leave the

house on 16.12.1993 as alleged, but she left the house along with

her cousin on 19.10.1993. A letter was sent when she was in her

own house.

      6. As many as four issues were framed by Sub Court. PW1

to PW3 were examined and Exts. A1 to A7 series were marked on

the side of plaintiff. First defendant was examined as DW1. No

document was marked on defendants' side. After analysing the

evidence, court below found plaintiff is entitled to get `15,000/-

with interest and also 25 sovereigns of gold ornaments. The story

of repayment was found to be not proved. It was also held that

gold ornaments were also not returned. Plaintiffs were allowed to

realise value of gold ornaments, if gold ornaments are not

returned, fixing the value of gold ornaments at the time of

marriage, which is to be decided at the time of execution of

decree. Decree was granted for a sum of `15,000/- @ 12 % per

annum from the date of suit till realisation.

      7. The above decree and judgment are challenged in this

AS. 901/97                      -4-

appeal. Heard both sides. The points for determination arise in

this appeal are:

          1. Whether defendants-appellants are liable to
              return `15,000/-?

          2. Whether appellants repaid `15,000/- received by
              them ?

          3. Whether first plaintiff was given 25 sovereigns
              of gold ornaments as shown in the plaint
              schedule at the time of marriage and those
              were appropriated by defendants ?

          4. Whether defendants are liable to return
              `15,000/- and gold ornaments as shown in the
              plaint schedule ?

          5. Whether there is any ground to interfere with
              the decree and judgment ?

      Points:

      8.    Plaintiffs-respondents claimed `15,000/- from the

defendants-appellants which were allegedly given at the time of

fixing the marriage to the defendants-appellants. According to

defendants, the said amount was returned and it will be evidenced

by the agreement which was torn off and re-fixed and produced in

the divorce petition. The said document is not produced in this

case.     On analysis of the evidence, trial court found that

appellants failed to prove that amount was returned.          On

AS. 901/97                         -5-

consideration of the arguments advanced, we do not find any

reason to interfere with such findings.      There is only a mere

assertion that amount was returned.         But from the admission

made by first defendant while examined as DW1, it is clear that

there is absolutely no document evidencing return of `15,000/-.

He deposed that a receipt was given when `.15,000/- was paid to

the defendants and hence, normally when such amount is repaid

also, it is probable that documents will be created. He

categorically deposed in cross examination that there is no such

document.

      9.   Learned counsel for appellant argued that under the

provisions of Dowry Prohibition Act, a suit for return of dowry will

not be maintainable. It is pointed out that as per the pleadings in

the plaint, amount and gold ornaments are given as dowry on

demand allegedly made by defendants. Therefore, in the light of

the decision reported in 1975 KLT 86, Thomas Vs. Sarakutty

the suit itself is not maintainable.

      10.   Learned counsel for plaintiff-respondent argued that

there are subsequent decisions of Division Benches decisions of

this court wherein      it is clearly held that provisions of Dowry

AS. 901/97                       -6-

Prohibition Act will not be a bar to file suit for recovery of amount

or gold ornaments which are given as dowry because it is paid in

trust and the wife is entitled to seek recovery of the said amount

and gold ornaments. He also cited decisions reported in 1991(2)

KLT 71 Scariah Varghese vs. Marykutty.

      11. On going through the above decision and also 1980

KLT 353 Mary Vs Cherchi and Others, it is clear that present

suit will not be barred in the light of dictum laid down in the said

decision.   It is also seen that the decisions cited by learned

counsel for appellant is overruled in 1980 KLT 353. There is also

another Division Bench decision of this court reported in 2006(4)

KLT 106 Aliyamma Vs. Thomas which was also go to show that

suit of this nature is not barred by the provisions of Dowry

Prohibition Act. Hence, argument raised regarding maintainability

of the suit can only be rejected and we do so.

      12. Now the crucial aspect is what is the quantum of gold

ornaments which were given to the first plaintiff at the time of

marriage. The details are shown in the plaint schedule.           No

witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiff to give details

of gold ornaments. There is only an assertion that 25 sovereigns

AS. 901/97                        -7-

of gold ornaments were given without stating any details

regarding the description or the weight. However, specific

questions were put to DW1 in cross examination referring to the

weight of the gold ornaments and the description. To prove that

first plaintiff was given certain gold ornaments, Ext.A6 photograph

was produced.

      13. DW1 admitted that it is the photograph taken at the

time of marriage. In cross examination, with reference to the

photographs and gold ornaments, DW1 deposed that ten bangles

are seen in the right hand and when a suggestion was made that

bangles were having one sovereign each, he could not deny the

same. He only pleaded ignorance. Therefore, it has to be held

that ten bangles having one sovereign each had been given at the

time of marriage as seen from ExtA6 photograph.

      14. Though DW1 deposed in cross examination that in the

left hand there are no bangles, but it looked like bracelet. When

questions were put in reference to necklace, chain, the details of

sovereigns of necklace, two chains and the bracelet DW1 could

not deny the same, but only stated he did not know the details.

From the evidence given by DW1 in cross examination, it appears

AS. 901/97                            -8-

that first plaintiff was given ten gold bangles each having one

sovereign and also necklace having 11/2 sovereigns and 'Karimani'

chain having two sovereigns and another chain having five

sovereigns, bracelet having three sovereigns and another chain

having = sovereign, altogether gold ornaments have 22

sovereigns in total.

      15.    Apart from the details brought out in the cross

examination of DW1, no independent evidence is adduced by

plaintiff to establish whether any other details of gold ornaments

were given.      In such circumstances, we find that plaintiffs-

respondents are entitled to get the following :

10 gold bangles         1 sovereign each

1   necklace            11/2 sovereigns

1   'Karimani' chain 2 sovereigns

1   chain               5 sovereigns

1   bracelet            3 sovereigns

1   chain               = sovereign
                     ------------------------
      TOTAL :           22 sovereigns


      16. Plaintiff has claimed `92,400/- as value of 200 gms of

gold Jewellery. There is no dispute on the value of gold jewellery

AS. 901/97                        -9-

and hence we accept the claim at the above rate. Plaintiffs are

entitled to get the value of gold jewellary for 22 sovereigns from

the appellants, in case they are not returning the gold ornaments

as stated above. The interest awarded seems to be on the higher

side, since the case does not involve commercial transaction.

Since there is no dispute regarding the value of the gold

ornaments, we find that value assessed by plaintiff can be granted

and it is not necessary to fix the value at the time of execution of

decree. Hence the decree is to be modified and the following

decree is passed:

            1. Plaintiffs are allowed to realise `15,000/- with

               6% interest per annum from defendant nos.1

               and 2 from the date of suit till realisation.

           2. Defendants shall return 22 sovereigns of gold

               ornaments as detailed in the judgment.

           3. On failure to comply with the above,

               defendants shall pay `.92,400/- as value of

               gold ornaments with 6% interest per annum

               from the date of decree till realisation to the

               plaintiffs within one month from the date of

AS. 901/97                    -10-

             this decree.

           4. Defendant nos.1 and 2 are jointly and

             severally liable to return 22 sovereigns of

             gold ornaments or the value at `.92,400/- to

             the plaintiffs and they shall do so within one

             month from the date of receipt of this decree.

                  This appeal is partly allowed.

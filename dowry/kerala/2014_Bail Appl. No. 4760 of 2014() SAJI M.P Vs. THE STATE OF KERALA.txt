             Dated this the 4th day of July, 2014


                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.

425/2014 of Pandalam Police Station, which has been

registered for offences under sections 498A, 406 and 323 of

IPC.




     3.   The petitioner is the husband of the 1st informant.

The other accused are his parents and close relatives. It is

alleged that, demanding more dowry, they subjected the 1st

informant   to   cruelty   and    they    misappropriated her

properties.




     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

                               -2-



     5.    The petitioner and the 1st informant have been

married for about 14 years. They have two children. The

prosecution has no case that the 1st informant has sustained

any serious injuries. I think this is a fit case to make an

attempt for bringing harmony to the family.            So I am

inclined to grant the prayer of the petitioner.




     6.    In the result, this application is allowed.

      i.   The petitioner shall be released on bail on

           his executing a bond for Rs.20,000/-

           (Rupees Twenty thousand only) with two

           solvent sureties each for the like sum if he

           is arrested by the Police in connection with

           this case.

      ii.  He shall appear before the Investigating

           Officer for interrogation if he is so required

           by him in writing.

      iii. He shall not destroy or tamper with

           evidence.

                             -3-




      iv. He      shall not   harass    the    defacto

           complainant or her relatives.

     This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose/s

to surrender before the Magistrate concerned and in such

case the learned Magistrate may take appropriate action in

accordance with the law.

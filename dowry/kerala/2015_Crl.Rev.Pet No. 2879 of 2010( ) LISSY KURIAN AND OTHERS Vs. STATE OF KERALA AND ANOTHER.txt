           Dated this the 16th day of November 2015

                                O R D E R


       The revision petitioners are accused Nos.2 to 4 in

C.C. No.290 of 2007 on the files of the Court of the

Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Pala.                      The offence

alleged against the revision petitioners is the offence under

Section 498-A read with Section 34 I.P.C.

     2. The de-facto complainant filed a private complaint

against the revision petitioners and the other accused

alleging harassment by the revision petitioners and the

other accused against the de-facto complainant demanding

Crl.R.P.2879/2010
                             : 2 :

more dowry.      The revision petitioners are the mother,

brother and the father of the first accused. The revision

petitioners filed C.M.P. No.3481 of 2009 before the court

below under Section 239 of the Code praying for

discharge. The said petition was dismissed by the court

below. Aggrieved by the said order, this revision petition

has been filed.

      3. The court below, after going through the police

report, found that there are materials primafacie making

out the offence under Section 498-A read with Section 34

I.P.C. against the revision petitioners and the other accused.

I have gone through the statement of witnesses recorded by

the Police. I have also gone through the complaint filed by

the    de-facto complainant.      It is borne out from the

Crl.R.P.2879/2010
                              : 3 :

statement of witnesses recorded by the police that there are

materials against the revision petitioner Nos.1 and 2

constituting the offence under Section 498A. However, no

material is available before the court against the third

petitioner and hence, it has to be held that the charge

against the third revision petitioner is groundless.

However, there are materials to primafacie make out an

offence under Section 498A read with Section 34 I.P.C.

against the other revision petitioners and hence, it cannot

be said at this stage that the charge against them is

groundless.      For the said reason, the third revision

petitioner is entitled to be discharged from the proceedings

in the case.

      In the result, this revision petition stands allowed in

Crl.R.P.2879/2010
                            : 4 :

part confirming the order passed by the court below as

regards revision petitioner Nos.1 and 2 and setting aside

the order passed by the court below as regards the third

petitioner in C.M.P. No.3481 of 2009 and the third revision

petitioner    is discharged   from    the   proceedings  in

C.C.No.290 of 2007 on the files of the court below. The

court below shall be at liberty to proceed against the other

accused, in accordance with law.

      It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the

revision petitioners    that the revision petitioners are

residing nearly 400 k.m. away from the court. Considering

the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view

that a direction can be issued to the learned Magistrate not

to insist upon the personal appearance of the revision

Crl.R.P.2879/2010
                           : 5 :

petitioners before the court, except on days when their

presence is utmost necessary and accordingly, I order so.

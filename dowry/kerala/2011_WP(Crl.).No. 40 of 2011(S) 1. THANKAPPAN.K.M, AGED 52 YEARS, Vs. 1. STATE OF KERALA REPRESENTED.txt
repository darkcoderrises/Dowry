                              JUDGMENT
   Joseph J.,

      The petitioner has approached this Court seeking the following

prayer:

      "to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus, commanding respondents 2

to 4 to produce the body of petitioner's wife Prassanna aged 48 years

and younger daughter Soumya aged 23 detained by respondents 5

and 6"

      2.   Briefly put the case of the petitioner is as follows. The

petitioner belongs to scheduled tribe. He alleges the illegal detention

of his wife and younger daughter. Sixth respondent is the elder

daughter.   She fell in love with the fifth respondent.               This was

objected by the petitioner. The marriage took place as evidenced by

Ext.P1. Thereafter they started harassing the petitioner demanding

dowry and share in the property. On On 11.1.2011 respondents came

and told the petitioner that they are going to get married as per the

rites and customs prevailing in the Christian Community. This was

W.P.(Crl.) No. 40 of 2011
                                     :2:

   objected by the petitioner. Thereafter on 11.1.2011 a group of people

   under the leadership of the 5th respondent came to the house of the

   petitioner and threatened him and demanded money, gold ornaments

   and property. The wife of the petitioner and younger daughter of the

   petitioner attended the function and they have not come back.

         3. Today when the matter came up, the alleged detenue were

   produced before us. We interacted with them. The alleged detenue

   would say that they are not under any illegal detention and they do

   not want to live with the petitioner.

         4. In the light of this, we see no reason to issue any orders in

   this matter and this Writ Petition is dropped. This will be without

   prejudice to the rights of petitioner to approach any other appropriate

   forum.

                                            (JUDGE)


                                  M. L. JOSEPH FRANCIS,
                                            (JUDGE)

                   Crl.M.C.No.2937 of 2014
           -------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 6th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER

      This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused in S.C No.527/2013 on the file of Assistant Sessions

Court, Koyilandi to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement u/s 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are arrayed as

accused in Crime No.648/2010 of Balussery Police Station

registered on the basis of the statement given by the second

respondent as de facto complainant           as Annexure A1 First

Information Report alleging offence u/s 436 of the Indian Penal

Code. Later, after investigation, final report was filed before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate - II, Perambra and the case was

committed to Sessions Court where it was taken as S.C

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014             2


No.527/2013 and made over to Assistant Sessions Court, Koyilandi

for disposal and it is pending before that court. There was another

case between some of the members of petitioner's party and de

facto complainant's party alleging offences u/ss. 143, 147, 148,

448, 341, 323, 324 and 307 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code and after investigation and committal, it was taken on file as

S.C No.742/2011 and that was ended in acquittal as per Annexure

A4 judgment of Additional Sessions Court - IV, Kozhikode on the

basis of settlement. Now the present dispute also resolved between

the parties and on account of the settlement there is no possibility

of conviction. Since the offence alleged is non-compoundable in

nature, they cannot file an application for compounding before the

court concerned.       So they have no other remedy except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014               3


                       Pass an order quashing Annexure A1
                  FIR, A2 final report in Crime No. 648/2010
                  of Balussery Police Station and S.C
                  No.527/2013 of Assistant Sessions Court,
                  Koyilandi, for the interest of justice.


      3.    Second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

connected crimes were also settled on account of the intervention

of respectable members of both parties and that was ended in

acquittal. So he does not want to prosecute the petitioner any

longer. He filed Annexure A5 affidavit stating these facts.

      4. Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that in view of

the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and he prayed

for allowing the application.

      5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as directed by

this court, submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioners but, considering the fact that grave offences have been

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014              4


incorporated, there is no need to invoke Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure and opposed the application.

      6.   It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent as de facto complainant, Annexure

A1 First Information Report was registered as Crime No. 648/2010

of Balussery Police Station against the present petitioners alleging

offence u/s 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and after

investigation, Annexure A2 final report was filed and after

committal, it is now pending before the Assistant Sessions Court,

Koyilandi as S.C No.527/2013. Now the matter has been settled

between the parties.    It is also averred in the petition that in

connection with some incident between the same groups, there was

another case as Crime No. 648/2010 of Balussery Police Station

and that was also settled and since none of the witnesses have

supported the prosecution and turned hostile in view of the

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014               5


settlement, the accused in those case were acquitted which is

evident from Annexure A4 judgment. It is true that it is a clash

between two political parties. However, now they have settled

their disputes taking into account the peace to be restored in the

locality due to the intervention of the members of both parties.

Considering the fact that the parties have settled the dispute, there

is no possibility of any conviction in such cases as they will not

support the case of the prosecution. Allowing the case to continue

in such circumstances will amount to wastage of judicial time. If

wisdom has dawn in the mind of the political parties to settle their

scores at the later stage with a view to bring harmony in the society

and with a hope that they will not continue same in future, then

such an attempt made on the side of the political parties will have

to be encouraged.

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014                 6


      7. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:

                        "The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the power
           of the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding
           or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
           given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is
           of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
           justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
           where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
           of each case and no category can be prescribed.
           However, before exercise of such power, the High
           Court must have due regard to the nature and
           gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
           mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
           though the victim or victim's family and the offender
           have settled the dispute.      Such offences are not
           private in nature and have serious impact on society.
           Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
           offender in relation to the offences under special
           statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
           offences committed by public servants while working
           in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
           quashing     criminal   proceedings   involving  such
           offences.        But   the  criminal    cases  having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014                 7


           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership
           or such like transactions or the offences arising out
           of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
           words, the High Court must consider whether it
           would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
           to    continue  with   the   criminal   proceeding   or
           continuation    of  the   criminal  proceeding    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
           settlement and compromise between the victim and
           wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
           it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if
           the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
           the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
           quash the criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled between

the parties and there is no scope of conviction in view of the

settlement, this court feels that this is a case where the power under

Crl.M.C No.2937/2014                 8


Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to

quash the proceedings to promote the settlement that has been

brought in between two political parties taking into account the

public interest of the society who always want peace in the locality

which is being thwarted due to the unwanted motiveless fight

between lower rank sympathizes of the political parties.

        In the result, the petition is allowed and further proceedings

in S.C No.527/2013 pending before the Assistant Sessions Court,

Koyilandi as against the petitioners is hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court immediately for necessary further action in the matter.

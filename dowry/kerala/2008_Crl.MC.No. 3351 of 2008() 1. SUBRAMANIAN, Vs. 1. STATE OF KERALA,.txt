              Dated this the 31st day of October, 2008

                                O R D E R

       Petitioner, the husband of the defacto complainant along

with some others, faces allegations now for offences punishable,

inter alia, under Section 498 A IPC. He has come to this Court

now to challenge cognizance taken for the offences punishable

under the Dowry Prohibition Act             against him by the learned

Magistrate.

      2. There is a long story behind this case. The petitioner is

admittedly the husband of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent

filed a private complaint alleging commission of offences, inter

alia, under Section 498 A IPC against the petitioner herein and his

relatives. That complaint was referred to the police under Section

156(3) Cr.P.C.      A crime was registered.                Investigation was

conducted and final report was filed. Cognizance was taken and

the case was registered as CC No.62/01.                        In that case,

significantly, cognizance was taken only of the offences

punishable under Sections 406 and 498 A read with Section 34

IPC. It is submitted that some of the accused had come to this

Crl.M.C. No. 3351 OF 2008
                                -:2:-


Court for quashing of proceedings.           Such attempts were

unsuccessful. The matter went back to the Magistrate to continue

the proceedings. At that stage when the 2nd respondent received

summons to appear in court to give evidence, she came to know

that her allegations under the Dowry Prohibition Act had not been

adverted to or considered by the investigating officers.      She

therefore filed CMP No.1216/07 complaining about failure of

justice and seeking directions under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C to

conduct a further investigation. The learned Magistrate by order

dated 09.04.07, directed the conduct of such further investigation.

It is thereupon that the further investigation was undertaken and

further final report under Section 173(8) dated 09.11.07(Annexure

A4) was filed before the learned Magistrate. It is on such further

report that the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences

punishable under the Dowry Prohibition Act also in addition to the

cognizance already taken for the offences punishable under

Sections 406 and 498 A read with Section 34 IPC.

       3. The petitioner claims to be aggrieved by the impugned

order.   What is the grievance ?     The learned counsel for the

Crl.M.C. No. 3351 OF 2008
                                  -:3:-


petitioner submits that the directions for further investigation at the

instance of the complainant is unjustified. The said contention

cannot obviously be accepted now. It is trite after the decision in

Shaji V. State of Kerala [2003(2) KLT 929] that the court can

direct further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C even when

the requirement is pointed out by the victim/complainant.

Preposition (v) in paragraph 20 of Shaji(supra)settles that

controversy beyond any pale of doubt.

       4. I am in these circumstances satisfied that the grievance

raised by the petitioner is not justified. This Crl.M.C is accordingly

dismissed. I may hasten to observe that the observations in this

order will not in any way fetter the rights of the petitioner and co-

accused to raise appropriate contentions before the learned

Magistrate in their attempt to claim discharge initially or acquittal

latter.

           ----------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C.No. 2935 of 2013
           ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 17th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

      First petitioner is the defacto complainant and the 2nd

petitioner is the accused in Crime No.504/2013 of the Palakkad

Town South Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Sections 323, 406, 498A and 506(2) r/w Section 34 of

IPC. According to the petitioners, who were in love, married on

14/8/2012 under the Special Marriage Act against the wishes

of their parents. According to the defacto complainant while

they were residing together, due to a misunderstanding,

difference of opinion occurred among them which resulted in

filing a complaint against her husband on the basis of which

crime 504/2013 was registered. Now the case of the defacto

complainant and the accused is that the matter is settled out of

Court and they are residing together. Therefore they filed this

petition together under Section 482 of Cr.P.C with a prayer to

quash the proceedings in Crime No.504/2013 of the Palakkad

Town South Police Station.

      2.    Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No. 2935 of 2013
                                2

      3.    From the facts stated above which can be seen that

the petitioners are wife and husband who married as per

Provision of Special Marriage Act that too against the wishes

and ambitions of their respective family and parents. When

they are residing together, according to the petitioners due to

a misunderstanding, they fell apart. Consequently the first

petitioner filed a private complaint against the second

petitioner before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Palakkad which eventually resulted in Crime No.504/2013 of

the Palakkad Town South Police Station, for the said offences.

Now the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled

between themselves amicably and they are residing together

and leading a peaceful marital life and hence the fist petitioner

who is defacto complainant is not interested in proceedings

with the prosecution against the petitioner who is her own

husband. Annexure-A2 is the affidavit sworn into by the first

petitioner who is the defacto complainant.

      4.    As the spouses sorted out their disputes and settled

the same and especially when the marriage is registered under

the Special Marriage Act, according to me this Court should

encourage such settlement arrived between the spouses and to

Crl.M.C.No. 2935 of 2013
                                    3

see on such settlement allow them lead a peaceful marital life.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

Crl.M.C.No. 2935 of 2013
                                     4

         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

         or such like transactions or the offences arising out

         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         5.    According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

Crl.M.C.No. 2935 of 2013
                                5

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime

No.504/2013 of Palakkad Town South Police Station pending

against the second petitioner.

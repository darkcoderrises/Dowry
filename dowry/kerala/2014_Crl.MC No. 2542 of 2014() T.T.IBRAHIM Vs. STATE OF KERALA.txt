                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.2542 of 2014
                   ..................................................
               Dated this the 16th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This is an application filed by the petitioner, who is the

sole accused in C.C.No.303/2013 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Manjeri to quash the proceedings under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Code').

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner married

the second respondent/defacto complainant on 30.5.1998 and

thereafter they were residing together as husband and wife.

There was some difference of opinion arose between the parties

and the second respondent filed a private complaint before

the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri against the

petitioner alleging commission of offence under Section 498 A of

the Indian Penal Code, which the learned Magistrate forwarded

to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code.

On that basis, Karippur police had registered a case as crime

No.539/2013 under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code

against the petitioner and after investigation, Annexure -I Final

                                     2

Report was filed and the learned Magistrate had taken the case

on file as C.C.No.303/2013 and it is pending before that court.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties amicably

due to intervention of mediators and family members. The

defacto complainant also filed an affidavit to that effect. No

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case in view of the

settlement. Since the offence is non compoundable one, the

petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this Court

seeking the following relief:

                " In  the above circumstances,     it is most

          humbly   prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be

          pleased to quash all further proceedings in

          C.CNo.303/2013 (arising out of Crime No.539/2013

          of Karippur Police Station) pending before the

          Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri, as it is an

          abuse of process of Court".

      3. The learned Public Prosecutor appeared for the 1st

respondent and        the second      respondent       appeared through

counsel.

      4. The counsel for the second respondent submitted that

the matter has been settled between the                     parties due to

intervention of mediators and the defacto complainant does not

                                 3

want to prosecute the case in view of the settlement. She had

filed an affidavit to that effect as well.

      5. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of

the settlement even if the case is allowed to prosecute, no

purpose will be served. So he prayed for allowing the

application.

      6. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor.

      7. I have considered the contentions of both the parties.

      8. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner married the

second respondent in the year 1998 and thereafter they lived

together as husband and wife and after some time, difference

of opinion arose between them and they separated and Crime

No.539/2013 was registered by the Karippur police station on

the basis of a private complaint filed by the second respondent

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri which was

forwarded for investigation to the police by the learned

Magistrate and after investigation, Annexure-I final report was

filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.303/2013 and pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri. Now the

matter has been settled between the parties. The second

respondent filed Annexure-II affidavit stating that the matter

                                    4

has been settled between the parties due to intervention of

mediators and they had decided to separate and she does not

want to prosecute the petitioner and proceed with the criminal

case in view of the settlement.

    9. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

        "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

        pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

        footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

        offences arising from commercial, financial mercantile,

        civil, partnership or such like transactions or the

        offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry,

        etc., or the family disputes where the wrong is

        basically private or personal in nature and the parties

        have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of

        cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

        its view, because of the compromise between the

        offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

        remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

        would put accused to great oppression and prejudice

        and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

        quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

        settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

                                       5

          words, the High Court must consider whether it would

          be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

          continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

          of the criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse

          of process of law despite settlement and compromise

          between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to

          secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that

          criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the

          above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

          be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

          proceeding."

      10. Considering the            dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a matrimonial

dispute and the matter has been settled between the parties due

to intervention of mediators and family members and they

have decided to separate and lead a peaceful life in view of the

settlement and no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case as well as the defacto complainant or her witnesses

are not likely to support the prosecution and conviction in such

case is remote and the future life of the spouses should not be

affected on account of the pendency of this case, this Court feels

that it is a fit case where power under Section 482 of the Code

                                  6

has to be invoked to quash the proceedings. So the application

is allowed and further proceedings in C.C.No.303/13(Crime

No.539/13 of Karippur police station) pending before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Manjeri is hereby quashed.

     Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

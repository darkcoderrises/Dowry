                 ---------------------------------
           Dated this the 28th day of October, 2014.

                            O R D E R


      The petitioners are accused Nos.2 to 5 in Crime

No.716/2014 of Pariyaram Medical College Police Station for

offences alleged under Sections 498(A) r/w 34 IPC.          The

allegation is that the 1st accused married the defacto

complainant and while they are living as spouses in the

matrimonial   home and       at   her   residence, the   defacto

complainant was mentally and physically harassed by the

accused persons for more dowry and gold etc. The 1st and 4th

petitioners are the parents of the 1st accused and petitioners 2

& 3 are the brother and sister of the 1st accused/husband. It is

the case of the petitioners that the defacto complainant

harassed the petitioners herein.      The husband (A1) of the

defacto complainant is employed in Military Services and

almost all days the defacto complainant is residing with her

parents since her husband is out of station in connection with

his employment and that the defacto complainant insisted the

1st accused to reside along with her parents for which the 1st

accused is not ready and on the basis of this the instant case

has got triggered. Sri.Zubair Pulikool, learned counsel for the

petitioners, would submit that this Court may allow the plea of

pre-arrest bail to the petitioners in the interest of justice.

      2.   The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the

investigation is not complete and that in case this Court is

inclined to exercise discretion to allow the plea of pre-arrest

bail to the petitioners, then sufficient strict safeguards may be

incorporated in the order so as to protect the bonafide interest

of the prosecution.

      3.   After having considered the submissions of the

learned counsel for the petitioners and learned Public

Prosecutor and on a consideration of the totality of the facts

and circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to allow

the plea of pre-arrest bail to the petitioners in this case, but,

subject to necessary safeguards so as to protect the interest of

prosecution. Accordingly it is ordered that in the event of the

petitioners  beings    arrested     in  connection     with   Crime

No.716/2014 of Pariyaram Medical College Police Station, they

shall be released on bail on their executing a bond for `

35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand only) each with two

solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the

           (i)    The petitioners shall surrender their
     passports, if any, before the court below concerned
     within three days from the execution of the bail bond
     before the investigating officer and if either of them
     is not a holder of passport, then they shall file
     affidavit to that effect in the said court.         If the
     petitioners require their passport in connection with
     their travel abroad, then they are free to approach
     the court concerned for the release of the same and
     for necessary permission in that regard. In case if
     such an application is filed, the court below
     concerned is free to consider the same on merits and
     to pass appropriate orders thereon, taking necessary
     guidance from the principles laid down in the
     decision of this Court in the case Asok Kumar v.
     State of Kerala, reported in 2009 (2) KLT 712,
     notwithstanding      the    aforementioned      conditions
     imposed by this Court.
           (iii) The petitioners shall not involve in any
     criminal offence of similar or graver nature.
           (iv)  The petitioners shall co-operate with the
     investigation and report before the investigating officer
     as and when required.
           (v)   The petitioners shall not attempt to influence
     the witnesses or shall not tamper or tamper evidence in
     any manner whatsoever.

If the petitioners fail to comply with any of the conditions as

ordered above, the bail granted to them are liable to be

cancelled.

     Accordingly, this application stands finally disposed of.




                                             ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                      Judge.

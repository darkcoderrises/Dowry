               Dated this the 25th day of March, 2014


                                      O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.51/2014 of Rajapuram

Police Station for quashing the proceedings in view of the

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No.51/2014

of Rajapuram Police Station, registered on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent injured as defacto-

complainant, alleging offences under Section 341 and 323

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.                                     The

petitioners and defacto-complainant were neighbours. Due

to the intervention of mediators and well-wishers the matter

has been settled between them. The defacto-complainant

Crl. M.C. No.1691 of 2014
                                  2

does not want to proceed with the investigation or

prosecute the petitioners in view of the settlement.             No

purpose will be served by proceeding the investigation or

ultimately the trial of the case, if final report is filed, in view

of the settlement. Since, it is in the crime stage, neither the

police nor the court will drop the proceedings. So they have

no other option, except to approach this court, seeking the

following relief:

             "In the above circumstances it is most humbly
      prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash
      Annexure-1 FIR in Crime No.51/2014 of Rajapuram
      Police Station now pending on the file of the Judicial
      First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg in the interest of
      justice."

            3.    2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled due to the

intervention of mediators and he does not want to proceed

with the case. He had also filed an affidavit stating these

facts. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that, in

view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

allowing the investigation to continue.

            4.    Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

Crl. M.C. No.1691 of 2014
                                  3

directed by this court submitted that, except this case,

there is no other case against the petitioners, but opposed

the application on the ground that, the investigation is in

the primitive stage.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent/ defacto-complainant,

Rajapuram Police Station has registered Annexure-A1 first

information report, as crime No.51/2014 against the

petitioners, alleging offences under Section 341 and 323

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Now the

matter     has    been    settled   between    the  parties.    2nd

respondent filed Annexure-II affidavit stating that, the

matter has been settled and the petitioners and the 2nd

respondent are neighbours. The settlement has arrived at

due to the intervention of mediators and the friendship has

been restored on account of the settlement and he does not

want to proceed with the investigation or prosecuting the

petitioners.

            6.    It is also seen from the allegations in the first

Crl. M.C. No.1691 of 2014
                                      4

information statement itself that, injuries sustained by the

defacto-complainant are only minor in nature. Further, it

was due to some mis-understanding that the incident had

happened. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility of

the defacto-complaint supporting the investigation and even

if ultimately final report is field, the possibility of conviction

against he petitioner is remote in view of this fact.

            7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.     Such offences are not

Crl. M.C. No.1691 of 2014
                                       5

      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s)
      is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the

decision cited (supra) and also considering the fact that, it

is a dispute between the neighbours regarding drainage

water through their properties and that has been now

settled between the parties and no purpose will be served in

allowing either the investigation or trial of the case to

Crl. M.C. No.1691 of 2014
                                  6

proceed with, as neither the defacto-complaint nor his

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution. This

court feels that, it is a fit case to invoke the power under

Section 482 of the 'Code' to quash the proceedings in order

to promote the harmony that has been restored on account

of the settlement arrived at between the neighbors. So the

application is allowed and further proceedings in Crime

No.51/2014 of Rajapuram Police Station, against the

petitioners are quashed.

            Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court, namely Judicial First Class magistrate

Court-I, Hosdurg, to inform the same to the concerned

police station for necessary further action in this regard.

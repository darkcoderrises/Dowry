                       ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                    ==================
                      Crl.M.C.No. 5942 of 2014
                    ==================
             Dated this the 21st day of October, 2014
                               O R D E R

      The above captioned Criminal Miscellaneous Case (Crl.M.C.)

seeking invocation of the inherent powers of this Court conferred

under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. has been field with the prayer to

quash the impugned criminal proceedings in L.P.C.No.7/2009 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur,

arising out of Crime No.111/2006 of Kannur City Police Station,

Kannur district, and all further proceedings arising therefrom. The

petitioner herein is the 1st accused in the aforementioned impugned

criminal proceedings. The 2nd respondent is the wife of the

petitioner and after their marriage, differences of opinion arose

between them and the 2nd respondent filed a complaint before the

police alleging that the petitioner and the other accused treated her

with cruelty with intention to compel to pay dowry. Thereupon

Crime No. 111/2006 was registered by the Kannur City Police on the

basis of the above said complaint/information lodged by the 2nd

CRL.M.C.5942/14                 - : 2 :-

respondent. The police, after investigation, filed final report before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur, for offences

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the I.P.C. The learned

Magistrate took cognizance of the offence punishable under Section

498A read with Section 34 of the I.P.C. against the accused and

numbered the case as C.C.No.533/2006. Annexure-A is the

impugned final report/charge sheet, which led to C.C.No.533/2006.

At the time when the trial commenced, the petitioner herein was

abroad and hence the case against accused Nos.2 to 4 were taken

up and the case against the petitioner herein was split up and re-

filed. The learned Magistrate as per Annexure-B judgment dated

16.10.2008 acquitted accused No.2 to 4. The case against the

petitioner was transferred to LPC (Long Pending Case) and has been

numbered as L.P.C.No.7/2009. Now the parties have settled the

matter out of court and it is mutually decided that the parties to

the marriage shall separate and the 2nd respondent shall withdraw

all the cases filed by her. The 2nd respondent has sworn to affidavit

dated 15.11.2014, produced as Annexure-C in this Crl.M.C. In the

said affidavit it is stated by the 2nd respondent that after the

marriage, differences of opinion arose between her and the

CRL.M.C.5942/14                 - : 3 :-

petitioner herein, which led to her filing of the above said complaint

due to the temperamental differences and implied imputations and

that now the matter has been amicably settled between the 2nd

respondent and the petitioner and that the settlement has been

arrived at voluntarily and that she has willingly parted company of

the 1st petitioner and is living happily on her own and that she

desires that the remnants of past life with the petitioner should not

remain as a dark cloud in her future life and that she does not want

to continue the prosecution against the petitioner, since it would

not now serve any purpose and that any further continuation of the

prosecution against the petitioner would cause her severe hardship

and mental tension and that she has no objection in allowing the

prayer in this Crl.M.C. by quashing the impugned proceedings in

L.P.C No.7/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-II, Kannur, arising out of Crime No. 111/2006 of Kannur City

Police Station. It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances that the aforementioned Crl.M.C. has been filed.

      2.     The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.D.Anil Kumar

has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State of Kerala.

CRL.M.C.5942/14                   - : 4 :-

      3.     Heard Sri. P.K.Ravi Sankar, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner, Sri.D.Anil Kumar, learned counsel appearing for R2

and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent-

State.

      4.     The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that

during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal proceedings,

the matter has been settled amicably between the parties, which is

resulted in the subject matter of the aforementioned crime/case and

that the continuation of the proceedings in the above case/crime

will cause miscarriage of justice to both parties as the real

disputants to the case have arrived at an amicable settlement and

any further continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to

sheer wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain

the judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.     The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent

has submitted on the basis of the specific instructions furnished by

the 2nd respondent that the 2nd respondent has amicably settled the

disputes with the petitioner and that she has no objection in the

quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any further

CRL.M.C.5942/14                   - : 5 :-

against the petitioner as she has no grievance against him and that

she will not raise any dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for

quashing the impugned final report is allowed.

      6.     The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who also

has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this Court

may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law well

settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.     After having carefully considered the submissions of the

parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen that

the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature and not

much element of public interest is involved. The crucial aspect of

the matter is that though such offences are involved, the real

disputants to the controversy which has led to the impugned

criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an amicable

settlement of the matter. From the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, it is clear to the court that

the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

at by them. In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision of

CRL.M.C.5942/14                          - : 6 :-

the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 =

2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as

follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

        can be"61.     The position that emerges from the above discussion
                  summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing
        a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
        inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given
        to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of
        the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
        engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
        to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power
        to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
        exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
        would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
        category can be prescribed.."

It is further held as follows:-

        "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
        dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
        purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
        commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
        transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
        dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
        private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
        criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
        between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
        remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
        accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
        wouldand caused to himsettlement
                  be               by not quashing the criminal case despite
        full
        victim........"complete                  and compromise    with  the


Further, in the case Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another reported in (2013) 4 SCC 58 [see 2013

(1) KLD 817 (SC)], the Apex Court has held as follows:-

CRL.M.C.5942/14                        - : 7 :-

             "8. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been
      on considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of
      complaints under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against
      the husband but also against the relatives of the husband. The
      question is when such matters are resolved either by the wife
      agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement
      of other pending disputes for which both the sides approached the
      High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal
      proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under Sections
      498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the
      sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under
      Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court
      to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

      to the 9.IPC of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and
                 It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent
      406 offilingand Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,
      1961, with the help and intervention of family members, friends
      and well-wishers, the parties concerned have amicably settled
      their differences and executed a compromise/ settlement.
      Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said compromise before
      the Trial Court with a request to place the same on record and to
      drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants herein. It is
      also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement
      arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an
      affidavit stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal
      proceedings against the appellants Itand fully supported the
      contents of the settlement deed.            is the grievance of the
      appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the
      parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction
      under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the
      criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under
      Sections 498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in
      nature.

             15. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage
      genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when
      the same are on considerable increase. Even if the offences are
      non-compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the
      Court is satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably
      and without any       pressure, we hold that for the purpose of
      securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a
      bar to the exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
      subsequent criminal proceedings.

      recent 16.  There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in
             times. The institution of marriage occupies an important

CRL.M.C.5942/14                      - : 8 :-

      place and it has an important role to play in the society.
      Therefore, every effort should be made in the interest of the
      individuals in order to enable them to settle down in life and live
      peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults and terminate
      their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it
      out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in the
      matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
      exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the
      power under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with
      circumspection only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of
      material on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
      would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of
      justice require that the proceedings ought to be quashed."

      8.     Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, it

is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have arisen

consequent to the personal disputes between the disputants and

the disputes have been settled amicably between the parties.

Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,

the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions of the

Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned criminal

proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

CRL.M.C.5942/14                   - : 9 :-

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount to

abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger sense.

Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra, this Court

is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by granting the

prayers sought for.

      9.     In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

proceedings in L.P.C.No.7/2009 on the          file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Kannur, arising out of Crime No.

111/2006 of Kannur City Police Station, are quashed. The petitioner

shall produce certified copies of this order before the court below

concerned as well as before the Station House Officer, Kannur City

Police Station.

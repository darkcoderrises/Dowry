    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1387 of 2014
    ==============================
      Dated this, the 28th day of February, 2014.


                          O R D E R


     This is an application filed by accused Nos.1 to 4 in

C.C.No.1416/13 (Crime No.824/13 of Kundara Police Station)

on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No-I,

Kollam, to quash the proceedings after recording the

composition under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime No.824/13 of Kundara Police

Station which was registered on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent de facto complainant alleging

offences under Sections.341 323, 324 read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code causing injury to the de facto complainant

and respondents 3 and 4. After investigation, final report has

been filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.1416/13 and

pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-I,

Kollam.   In the meantime, the dispute has been settled

between the parties.    Since some of the offences are non-

compoundable in nature, the same cannot be compounded

before the trial court. No purpose will be served by allowing

Crl.M.C.No.1387 of 2014         :  2 :

the case to proceed as there is no possibility of any conviction

being entered into against the petitioners. So, they filed this

petition seeking the following relief:

                  "To call for the records leading to Annexure A1

     charge sheet, pending as C.C.No.1416/13 before the Judicial

     First Class Magistrate Court-1, Kollam and to quash the same, as

     against the petitioners."




       3.    Respondents 2 to 4 appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and they have no objection in quashing the

proceedings.

       4.    Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submitted

that except this case, there is no other cases against the

petitioners and there is no criminal background as well. But,

however, opposed the application for quashing at this stage as

it is in the crime stage.

       5.    Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the

matter has been settled and they are friends even at the time

when the incident occurred and now the friendship has been

restored due to the settlement.

       6.    It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent, the Kundara police

Crl.M.C.No.1387 of 2014         :  3 :

has registered a case as Crime No.824/13 against the

petitioners alleging that they have caused injuries to

respondents 2 to 4 using a dangerous weapon. It is also an

admitted fact that after investigation, final report was filed and

it is now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-1, Kollam, as C.C.No.1416/13. It is seen from the

allegations in the petition that the matter has been settled

between the respondents 2 to 4 and the petitioners. It is also

alleged in the petition that the petitioners and respondents 2

to 4 were friends even at the time of the incident and the

incident occurred due to some misunderstanding and now due

to the intervention of mediators and well wishers, the matter

has been settled and their relationship restored.               They filed

affidavits before this court supporting this fact and also

expressing their intention not to proceed with the case against

the petitioners.

      7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding
      the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of
      wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

Crl.M.C.No.1387 of 2014           :  4 :

      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of
      each case and no category can be prescribed.          However,
      before exercise of such power, the High Court must have
      due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous
      and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like
      murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
      though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
      settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature
      and have serious impact on society.             Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation to
      the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
      the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
      from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
      and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
      category    of   case,   High   Court   may    quash    criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
      is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
      put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
      injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
      criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court
      must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
      interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
      continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to
      abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure
      the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put
      to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction
      to quash the criminal proceeding."



      8.     Considering the dictum laid in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the petitioners and the

Crl.M.C.No.1387 of 2014     :   5 :

injured victims including the de facto complainant are friends

even at the time when the incident occurred and the incident

itself happened due to some misunderstanding between them

which was later solved due to the intervention of mediators

and well wishers and friends and their relationship restored

and there is no possibility of any conviction being entered into

on account of the settlement and proceeding with the case will

only result in wastage of judicial time, this court feels that it is

a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

in order to promote the restoration of friendship between the

petitioners and the injured persons.

      So, the application is allowed and the further proceedings

in C.C.No.1416/13 (Crime No.824/13 of Kundara Police

Station) on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

No-I, Kollam, as against the petitioners is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

immediately.

                       Crl.M.C.No. 2786 of 2013
                    ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                                 O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No. 216 of 2013 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court - II, Hosdurg,         which is a case instituted

upon the police report in Crime No. 640 of 2012 of Nileshwar

Police Station for the offences punishable under Section 498A of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all proceedings in C.C.No.216 of 2013

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg as

the matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The case against the petitioner/accused is that the first

accused married the second respondent/the de facto complainant on

1.6.2003 in accordance with the rites and customs prevailing among

the Muslim religion. Thereafter, the de facto complainant resides

Crl.M.C.No.2786 of 2013


                                 :-2-:

along with the accused in her matrimonial home and while so, the

accused demanded more ornaments and money subjecting the de facto

complainant to mental and physical torture and thereby, the accused

committed the offence punishable under Section 498A. Now the case

of the petitioners is that during the pendency of the above case, the

parties to the dispute entered into an agreement as evidenced by

Annexure A3 and decided to separate mutually and they are residing

separately now. The second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit

Annexure A4, evidencing that the matter has been settled between the

party and she has no objection in terminating the proceedings initiated

against the petitioners as Crime No.440 of 2012.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

Crl.M.C.No.2786 of 2013


                                 :-3-:

between the parties to the dispute, which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and she has no

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

Crl.M.C.No.2786 of 2013


                                           :-4-:

the case, it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case is

only Section 498A, which is more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offence ia involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In

this juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in

the decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as

follows:-


                "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

         considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

         also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

                                             :-5-:

         home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.


                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

Crl.M.C.No.2786 of 2013


                                            :-6-:

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in

         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort

         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their

         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice

         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power

         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

Crl.M.C.No.2786 of 2013


                                            :-7-:

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A

of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated

from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the

parties want a quietus to the criminal case as well.

         8. According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement

arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision will

be squarely applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to

go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

                                  :-8-:

abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

proceedings in C.C.No.216 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg.

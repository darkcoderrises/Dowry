                    Crl. R.P. No. 2921 OF 2007 A
               ````````````````````````````````````````````````````
               Dated this the 14th day of August, 2007

                                 O R D E R


            The revision petitioner, who is the husband of Deepa,

the daughter of the 1st respondent Sreedevi Antharjanam,

challenges the order dated 26.6.2007 passed by the JFCM,

Nadapuram allowing CMP No.2534/07 filed by the 1st respondent

herein seeking further investigation under section 173(8) Cr.P.C.

      2.    The marriage between the revision petitioner(Rajesh

Namboothiri) and Deepa was solemnised on 30.8.1999. A child

also was born in that wedlock. Both of them were residing in the

residential house of Deepa. She died on 21.3.2005 at 9 p.m. due

to poison. According to the revision petitioner, she had committed

suicide by consuming poison. The 1st respondent herein would

allege that it was a case of forcible administration of poison to

Deepa by the revision petitioner, who used to physically and

mentally torture her with demands for dowry.

      3.    The case was originally registered as Crime No.113/05

of Vadakara Police Station for an offence punishable under

section 498A IPC. After the filing of the final report, the Magistrate

Crl.R.P.No.2921/07
                                   : 2 :


took cognizance of the offence and registered the case as

C.C.No.575/05.      After the examination of PWs 1 to 3, the 1st

respondent herein filed the above CMP alleging, inter alia, that her

daughter Deepa was subjected to cruelty by the revision petitioner,

who had forcibly administered poison to her and that besides 498A

IPC, the revision petitioner has committed offences punishable

under sections 304B and 306 IPC as well.

      4.     After hearing both sides, the court below allowed the

said petition filed by the 1st respondent herein.

      5.     The learned counsel appearing for the revision

petitioner made the following submissions before me in support of

the revision:-

      The police had conducted a meticulous and detailed

investigation during which the only offence which was, prima facie,

made out was one punishable under section 498A IPC and the

court below has not applied its mind to the facts and

circumstances of the case and no case has been made out for

further investigation under section 173(8) Cr.P.C.

      6.     I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above

submissions.      Even according to the revision petitioner, the

Crl.R.P.No.2921/07
                                : 3 :


original suicide note, which his wife had written before her death

and which was produced by him before the police, has not been

seized by the police or produced before court, but instead, what

has been produced by the police is only a photocopy of the diary

report dated 17.3.2005 alleged to be the suicide note of the

deceased.      The post mortem report pertaining to Deepa only

shows that she died of poison.       There was an ante mortem,

superficial incised wound 2.5 cm long seen on the frontal aspect of

the left wrist of the deceased and the circumstances under which

the deceased sustained the said injury has not been elicited in

investigation thus far conducted by the police. Similarly, there are

records to show that Deepa breathed her last not from the house

where she was residing but from the Medical College Hospital,

Kozhikode before which she had been rushed to the Kallachi

Hospital. The investigation does not show whether on the way to

hospital she had made any statement to any person regarding the

cause of her death or the circumstances under which she came to

consume poison. Similarly, there was no satisfactory investigation

conducted with regard to the headache which she was allegedly

suffering from.     These are the grounds which, prima facie,

Crl.R.P.No.2921/07
                                 : 4 :


influenced the court below to order further investigation. In the

light of the decision in Shaji Vs. State of Kerala [2003 (2) KLT

929], there cannot be any conceivable objection from the side of

the petitioner against further investigation by the police. If there

are shreds of undiscovered and undetected evidence which would

unravel the truth leading to the premature death of Deepa at the

young age of 25 years, the petitioner cannot fight shy to such

materials being unearthed by the investigating agency. I see no

reason to interfere with the order passed by the court below.

Whatever observations made and conclusions reached by the

court below as well as by this court are only prima facie

observations which will have no influence during the trial of the

case.

      This revision is accordingly dismissed.




                                           (V. RAMKUMAR, JUDGE)

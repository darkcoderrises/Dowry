                      Crl.M.C 1493 of 2014
                    ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 10th day of March, 2014


                            O R D E R

      This is an application filed by the petitioners, who are the

accused in CC No. 327/2006 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court II, Ernakulam to quash the proceedings

accepting the compromise entered into between them and the

defacto complainant under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Prcedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that the Ernakulam

Central Police has registered a case as Crime No. 462/2006 on

the basis of the statement given by the 2nd respondent herein

alleging commission of offences under Section 143, 147, 448,

323, 427 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code

against the petitioners. After investigation, the investigating

officer had submitted Annexure A1 final report before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, II, Ernakulam, where it

has taken on on file as CC 327/2006. Now the matter has

been settled between the parties due to the intervention of

mediators and well wishers.       No purpose will be served by

proceeding the case as the defacto complainant is not likely to

support the prosecution in view of the settlement. Since some

Crl.M.C 1493 of 2014
                               2

of the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could

not approach the lower court for compounding the case. So

they have no other remedy except to approach this court

seeking the following reliefs:

    "This Honourable Court may be pleased to quash the

    Annexure A-1 charge numbered as CC 327 of 2006 now

    pending before the Honourable First Class Magistrate Court,

    II against the petitioners in the interest of justice"

       3.   The 2nd respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he has filed Annexure A2 affidavit showing the

settlement and expressing their no objection in quashing the

proceedings.

       4.   The counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view

of the settlement, no purpose will be served in proceeding the

case. So he prayed for allowing the application.

       5.   The learned Public Prosecutor, on instruction as

directed by this court, submitted that there are no other

criminal cases pending against the petitioners or the 2nd

respondent and there is no criminal anticidents for the parties

as well, but opposed the application.

       6.   It is an admitted fact, that on the basis of the

Crl.M.C 1493 of 2014
                             3

statement given by the        2nd respondent, Ernakulam Central

Police has registered a case as Crime No. 462/2006 against

the petitioners alleging offences under Section 143, 147, 448,

323, 427 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and

after investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed by

Investigating Officer before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court II, Ernakulam and it was taken on file as CC 327/2006

by that court and it is pending before that court.          In the

meantime, parties have settled the disputes between them.

Further it is seen from the Annexure A2 statement, that the

matter has been settlement between the parties and it was in

fact a civil dispute between the land lord and the tenant, which

resulted in the alleged incident and registering of the crime.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties and the

defacto complainant has expressed his willingness to quash the

proceedings as well.

      8.    In the decision reported Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) it has been held as follows:

  "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
  summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
  criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
  inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
  given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under

Crl.M.C 1493 of 2014
                              4

 S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
 statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
 guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
 justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
 what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
 complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and
 victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and
 circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
 However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
 have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
 Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
 like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
 even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
 settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
 have serious impact on society.        Similarly, any compromise
 between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
 under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
 offences committed by public servants while working in that
 capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
 proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
 having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
 on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
 the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
 civil,  partnership or such like transactions or the offences
 arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
 disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
 nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
 this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
 proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between
 the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
 and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused
 to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
 be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
 and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
 other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be
 unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
 criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
 would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
 and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
 whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
 criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
 question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
 its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      8.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

Crl.M.C 1493 of 2014
                            5

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and no public interest is involved in

the case and the petitioners have no criminal anticidents and in

fact a civil dispute between a tenant and land lord have

resulted in the incident and no purpose will be served by

allowing the case to proceed with in view of the settlement, as

the possibility of conviction is remote, this Court feels that, it is

only a wastage of judicial time in allowing the case to proceed

with and it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to quash the

proceedings in order to promote the settlement entered into

between the parties, which resulted in restoring the harmony

between them.       So the application is allowed and further

proceedings in CC 327/2006 on the files of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court II, Ernakulam as against the petitioners

is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

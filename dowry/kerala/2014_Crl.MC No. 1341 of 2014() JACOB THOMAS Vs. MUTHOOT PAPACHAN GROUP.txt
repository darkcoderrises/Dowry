               Dated this the 28th day of March, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

sole accused in C.C.1219/2013 on the file of the Judicial Fist

Class   Magistrate           Court-I,         Ernakulam,              to      quash the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called the

`Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the accused in C.C.1219/2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam. The case

was originated on the basis of a complaint filed by the first

respondent through their authorised officer, against the

petitioner, alleging offence under Section 66A of the

Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 118(d) of

Kerala Police Act, 2011. After investigation, Annexure-A2

Crl.M.C. No.1341 of 2014
                                 2

final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.1219/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam. Now the matter has been

settled between the parties. The defacto-complainant does

not want to proceed with the prosecution.               Since the

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

file application before the court below. So the petitioner

has no other remedy, except to approach this court, seeking

the following relief:

            "For these and other grounds to be urged at the
      time of hearing it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble
      Court may kindly be pleased to quash Annexure-1 FIR
      and Annexure-A2 Final Report as well as the proceedings
      in CC. 1219 of 2013 on the file of Judicial First Class
      Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam and allow this Criminal
      MC."

            3.    First respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and they do not want to proceed against the

petitioner. So they have no objection in quashing the

proceedings.

            4.    The    learned     Public      Prosecutor   on

Crl.M.C. No.1341 of 2014
                                 3

instructions submitted that, except this case, there is no

other case against the petitioner, but opposed the

application.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of a

complaint given by the first respondent, Palarivattom Police

had registered Annexure-1 first information report, as

Crime No.1765/2010 of Palarivattom Police Station, against

the petitioner, originally alleging offence under Section 66A

of the Information Technology Act. Thereafter, after

investigation Annexure-II, final report was filed, alleging

offence under Section 118(d) of Kerala Police Act alone and

the same was taken on file as C.C.No.1219/2013 for the said

offence alone by the learned magistrate. Now the matter

has been settled between the parties. It appears that, there

was some labour dispute between the employees and the

management and now that has been settled between the

parties. So, the first respondent company does not want to

proceed against the petitioner, as the dispute has been

Crl.M.C. No.1341 of 2014
                                       4

settled between them. So on account of the settlement, no

purpose will be served by proceeding the case as well.

            6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong

Crl.M.C. No.1341 of 2014
                                       5

      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             7.     Though, the offence under the Police Act was

incorporated, it appears from the circumstances that, it is

purely a private dispute between the petitioner and the

officials of the first respondent company. In view of the

dictum laid down in the above decision and also considering

the fact that, in view of the settlement, there is no

possibility of conviction being entered against the petitioner

and directing the trial to continue will only be a wastage of

judicial time, this court feels that, the case can be quashed,

invoking the power under Section 482 of the 'Code'. So the

application       is   allowed       and     further     proceedings    in

C.C.No.1219/2013 (Crime No.1765/2010 of Palarivattom

Police Station), pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam, as against the petitioner is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to

the concerned court, immediately.

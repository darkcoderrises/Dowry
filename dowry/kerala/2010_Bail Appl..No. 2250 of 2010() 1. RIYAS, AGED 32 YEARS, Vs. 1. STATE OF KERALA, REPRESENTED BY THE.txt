                     B.A. No. 2250 of 2010
                 ------------------------------------
               Dated this the 25th day of May, 2010

                            O R D E R


      This petition is for anticipatory bail.

      2. The alleged offences are under Sections 498-A, 341,

323, 294(b) and 506(ii) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code. According to prosecution, petitioner is the husband of the

de facto complainant and after marriage, he used to harass the de

facto complainant mentally by demanding more dowry. He also

misappropriated gold ornaments given at the time of marriage.

Petitioner also married another woman and he started residing

with her.

      3. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that petitioner's

mother, brother-in-law and neighbour,who are accused Nos. 1, 2

and 4 were granted anticipatory bail by this Court.

      4. This petition is opposed. Learned Public Prosecutor

submitted    that  de   facto    complainant     was   subjected to

harassment after the marriage and petitioner married another

women and he is living separately from de facto complainant.

      5. On hearing both      sides,   I    find   that  granting of

B.A. No. 2250 of 2010            2




anticipatory bail to co-accused by itself is not a ground to grant

anticipatory bail to petitioner.    As per the allegations made

accused poured kerosene on de facto complainant's head and

shouted to kill her. Neighbours intervened and she was taken to

hospital. Petitioner has no explanation about the harassment on

the de facto complainant on demand for dowry or for marrying

another woman.         Only because in the last incident, petitioner

had not taken part. I do not think that this is a fit case to grant

anticipatory bail, while considering the serious nature of the

allegations made against him.

       Petition is dismissed.

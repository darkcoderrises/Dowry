                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No.7315 of 2014
             =======================
           Dated this the 12th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R



     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.418 of 2011 of the

Chandera Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR in Crime

No.418 of 2011 of the Chandera Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1016 of 2011 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C. No.7315 of 2014
                                 2

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints     against  the  petitioners     and,   therefore,   the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

Crl.M.C. No.7315 of 2014
                                   3

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1 FIR

in Crime No.418 of 2011 of the Chandera Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1016 of 2011 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, are

hereby quashed.

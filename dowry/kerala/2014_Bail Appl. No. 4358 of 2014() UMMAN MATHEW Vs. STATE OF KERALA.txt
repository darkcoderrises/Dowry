                    B.A. No. 4358 of 2014
            ------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 3rd day of July, 2014


                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioners are accused nos. 2 to 6 in Crime

No.162/2014 of Pooyappally Police Station, which has been

registered for offences under sections 498A and 506 of IPC.

     3.   The 1st accused is the husband of the 1st

informant. Petitioners 1 and 2 are his parents and the other

petitioners are his close relatives.         It is alleged that

demanding more dowry the 1st accused and the petitioners

subjected the 1st informant to cruelty and intimidated her

that she would be done away with.

     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   The marriage between the 1st accused and the 1st

informant was solemnized in January, 2009. They have no

B.A. No. 4358 of 2014
                               -2-



children. The 1st accused is working abroad. It is alleged

that he, along with the petitioners, subjected the 1st

informant to cruelty demanding more dowry and threatened

to cause her death.

     6.    It is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor

that petitioners 1 and 3 have already been deleted from the

array of accused. There is no allegation that any of the

petitioners caused any serious physical violence to the 1st

informant. Bringing back harmony to the family does not

appear to be an impossibility. So I am inclined to grant the

prayer of petitioners 2, 4 and 5.

     7.    In the result, this application is allowed.

      i.   Petitioners 2, 4 and 5 shall be released on

           bail on their executing a bond for

           Rs.20,000/-     (Rupees Twenty thousand

           only) each with two solvent sureties each

           for the like sum if they are arrested by the

B.A. No. 4358 of 2014
                               -3-



           Police in connection with this case.

      ii.  They shall appear before the Investigating

           Officer for interrogation if they are so

           required by him in writing.

      iii. They shall not harass the 1st informant or

           her     close  relatives  nor   shall  they

           intimidate or attempt to influence the

           witnesses.

     This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose to

surrender before the Magistrate concerned and in such case

the learned Magistrate may take appropriate action in

accordance with the law.

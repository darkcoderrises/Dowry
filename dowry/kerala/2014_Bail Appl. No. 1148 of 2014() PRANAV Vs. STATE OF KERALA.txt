                   ==========================
                    B.A. No. 1148 of 2014
               ===================================
          Dated this the 19th day of February, 2014


                            ORDER

      The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.115/2014 of

Kadakkal police station, Kollam.        The offences alleged

against him are under Secs.498A r/w 34 IPC.

      2.   The petitioner married the defacto complainant on

12.06.2012 and in that wedlock, a child was born to them.

It is alleged that the accused subjected the complainant to

physical and mental cruelty demanding more dowry to be

brought from her house. That was the demand he used to

make and so it became intolerable for her to bear the cruel

treatment meted out her.

      3.   There is specific allegation that just prior to the

incident in respect of which Crime No.111/2014 was

registered, she had been to her house. The petitioner was

stated to have telephoned to her that if she does not bring

                              -: 2 :-
B.A. No. 1148/2014

the money as demanded by her, she should not go to the

husband's house. Hence, she decided to end her life. She

along with her child jumped into well. The child died in the

incident.      She sustained injuries but she was somehow

saved. These factors would show that the allegations made

by the prosecution are prima facie true, the prosecution

contends.

      Considering the gravity of the allegations made, I am

not inclined to grant pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.

Hence, it is dismissed.

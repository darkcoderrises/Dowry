                        Crl.M.C.No. 2514 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 20th day of June, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'the Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 6 in C.C.No.2699 of 2010        of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam which is a case instituted

upon the police report in Crime No. 763 of 2010 of the Pallithottam Police

Station   for   the   offences      punishable      under    Sections 294(b),

341,323,324,427 and 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR

and Annexure 2 Final Report in Crime No.763 of 2010 of Pallithottam

Police Station as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that on 25.10.2010 at

about 9 p.m., the accused persons formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly and in furtherance of their common intention to assault the de

facto complainant due to previous animosity, used filthy language against

him and wrongfully restrained him and inflicted injuries and thereby,

Crl.M.C.No.2514 of 2013

                                   :-2-:

committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b),341,323,324,427

and 149 of I.P.C. and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

Adv.Sri.Siju Kamalasanan, counsel appearing for the second respondent. I

have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that

the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

         6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

Crl.M.C.No.2514 of 2013

                                    :-3-:

respective counsel. The second respondent filed Annexure 3 affidavit. I

have verified the documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

Sections 294(b),341,323,324,427 and 149 of I.P.C. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

Crl.M.C.No.2514 of 2013

                                             :-4-:

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                    "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

          Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

Crl.M.C.No.2514 of 2013

                                          :-5-:

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I FIR

and Annexure-2 Final Report in Crime No.763 of 2010 of Pallithottam

Crl.M.C.No.2514 of 2013

                                  :-6-:

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners

in C.C.No. 2699 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II,Kollam.

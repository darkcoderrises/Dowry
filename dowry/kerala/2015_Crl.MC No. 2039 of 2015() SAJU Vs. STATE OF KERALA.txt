           ................................................................
                   CRL. M.C. No.2039 of 2015
           ...............................................................
               Dated this the 7th day of April, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A5 in Crime No.62/14 of the East

Kallada Police Station, Kollam registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 354 and 498A read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting quashed Annexure A2 Final

Report as against the petitioners in Crime No.62/14 of the

East   Kallada        Police         Station        and        the      consequent

proceedings in C.C.No.1179/2014 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Kollam.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.2039 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,  who     is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.2039 of 2015
                              -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in Annexure A2 Final Report as against the

petitioners in Crime No.62/14 of the East Kallada Police

Station      and       the consequent       proceedings     in

C.C.No.1179/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-I, Kollam, are hereby quashed.

                   Crl.M.C.No.2538 of 2014
           -------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 26th day of May, 2014

                               ORDER

      This is an application filed by the accused in Crime

No.423/2014 of Thrissur East Police Station to quash the

proceedings on the basis of the settlement u/s 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are accused

numbers 1 to 6 in Crime no.423/2014 of Thrissur East Police

Station, which was registered on the basis of the statement given

by the first respondent alleging offences under Sections 143, 147,

448 and 506(i) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. The case

itself has been registered on the basis of some misunderstanding

occurred in the conduct of the foot ware shop of the de facto

complainant by the second petitioner and on account of that

misunderstanding     crimes    have     been    registered   and   O.S

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014              2



No.73/2014 was also filed before the Sub Court, Thrissur. Now, in

the mediation, the entire matter has been settled between the

parties and joint petition has been filed to withdraw the suit. The

first respondent also agreed to withdraw the criminal proceedings.

Since it is in the crime stage, neither the police nor the court will

drop further proceedings.      So they have no other remedy to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

                  Quash Annexure 1 proceedings (ie, Crime
                  No.423/2014 of Thrissur East Police
                  Station on the file of the Judicial First
                  Class Magistrate - I, Thrissur)


      3. First respondent appeared through counsel and submitted

that the matter has been settled in the mediation and all the

litigations pending between the parties have been agreed to be

withdrawn and he has no objection in allowing the application.

Learned counsel for petitioner also submitted that first respondent

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014               3



has filed Annexure 3 affidavit stating these facts. The Counsel for

petitioner has also stated that in view of the settlement no purpose

will be served by retaining the case. So, he pressed for allowing

the application.

      4. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that

the case has been registered on the basis of the business dispute

between the parties and the matter has been settled in the

mediation, but, opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that second petitioner and de facto

complainant were conducting a foot ware shop in Thrissur town

and there was some misunderstanding occurred in the conduct of

the business and on account of that, on the basis of the statement

given by first respondent Annexure 1 First Information Report was

registered earlier against three named persons and 36 identifiable

persons alleging offences under Sections 448, 395 and 506(ii) r/w

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014             4



Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Later, during investigation, it

was revealed that there were only 6 persons involved in the crime

and no offence under Sections 395 or 506(ii) of Indian Penal Code

were committed. But offences under Sections 143, 147, 448 and

506(i) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code alone were

committed. So, a report has been filed to delete Section 395 and

506(ii) of Indian Penal Code and add Section 143, 147 and 506(i)

r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and also implicate the

present petitioners as the only accused who involved in the crime.

Now, the entire disputes between the parties have been settled in

the mediation and as per the settlement the amounts due to the

parties have been quantified and paid and parties have agreed to

withdraw all the litigations including the civil suit filed in respect

of this dispute which is pending before the Sub Court, Thrissur as

O.S No.73/2014 and the criminal case registered.              Further,

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014                 5



petitioners and de facto complainant are related persons as well.

On account of the settlement the entire disputes between the parties

have been settled. Further, on going through the allegations it is

clear that it is a business dispute that resulted in the registering of

the crime and it cannot be said to be having any public interest as

such.

      6. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v State of Punjab

(2012(4) KLT108(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:

                        "The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the power
           of the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding
           or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
           given to a criminal court for compounding the
           offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is
           of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
           justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
           Court.   In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
           where the offender and victim have settled their
           dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances
           of each case and no category can be prescribed.
           However, before exercise of such power, the High
           Court must have due regard to the nature and
           gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014                 6



           mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
           dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even
           though the victim or victim's family and the offender
           have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
           private in nature and have serious impact on society.
           Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
           offender in relation to the offences under special
           statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
           offences committed by public servants while working
           in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
           quashing     criminal   proceedings     involving  such
           offences.       But    the   criminal    cases   having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership
           or such like transactions or the offences arising out
           of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private or
           personal in nature and the parties have resolved
           their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
           because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim. In other
           words, the High Court must consider whether it
           would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
           to    continue  with   the   criminal    proceeding  or
           continuation    of  the   criminal  proceeding    would
           tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
           settlement and compromise between the victim and
           wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
           it is appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if
           the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
           the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
           quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014                 7




      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that on account of the business dispute

misunderstanding arose between the parties and the criminal case

has been registered and civil suit filed and on account of the

mediation the matter has been settled between the parties and no

purpose will be served by proceeding the case any longer as neither

the de facto complainant nor the witnesses will support or

co-operate with the investigation so as to enable the police to file

final report and even if final report is filed conviction in such case

is remote, this court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked to

quash the proceedings in order to promote the relationship between

the parties and pendency of the crime should not be a hindrance for

the relationship to continue. So, the application is allowed and

Crl.M.C No.2538/2014               8



further proceedings in Crime No.423/2014 of Thrissur East Police

Station as against the petitioners is hereby quashed.

       Office is directed to communicate this order to the Judicial

First Class Magistrate - I, Thrissur so as to communicate the same

to the concerned Police Station for necessary further action in the

matter.

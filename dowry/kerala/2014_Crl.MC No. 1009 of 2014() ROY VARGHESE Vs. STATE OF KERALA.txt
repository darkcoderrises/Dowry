          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 18th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by

accused    Nos.        1     to      4     in      C.C.No.135/2013              (Crime

No.900/2011 of Alappuzha North Police Station) on the file

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Alappuzha, to quash

the proceedings, recording the settlement arrived at

between the petitioners and the defacto-complainant under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are relatives and on the basis of the complaint

given by the 2nd respondent, a case was registered as Crime

No.900/2011 of Alappuzha North Police Station, alleging

offences under Section 120(b), 420, 465 and 468 read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The allegation was

that, they obtained  1,20,000/- from the 2nd respondent,

Crl. M. C. No.1009 of 2014
                              2

promising a job in Afghanistan, thereafter they did not

either secure the job as promised or re-pay the money to

the 2nd respondent and they also sent a forged e-mail in this

regard and thereby they have committed the above said

offence. After investigation, the investigating officer

submitted Annexure-AI final report. It was taken on the file

as C.C.No.135/2013 on the file of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Alappuzha, and that is pending before

that court. In the meantime, the petitioners have settled

the claim with the defacto-complainant and the defacto-

complainant has no grievance against the petitioners now

and he does not want to proceed with the prosecution of the

case against the petitioners. Since certain offences are non-

compoundable in nature, they could not file an application

before the lower court for compounding the case. Since

they were not appearing before the court, non-bailable

warrants are also pending against them now. So they have

no other option, except to approach this court to quash the

Crl. M. C. No.1009 of 2014
                                 3

proceedings, invoking the power under Section 482 of the

'Code'. So the petitioners filed this application, seeking the

following relief:

            "For the grounds mentioned above and for other
      grounds that may be urged at the time of arguments, it is
      most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be
      pleased to quash Annexure-I charge-sheet and all
      proceedings in C.C.No.135/2013 of the C.J.M. Court,
      Alappuzha."

            3.     The 2nd respondent appeared though counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

him and the accused persons and he has no grievance

against them. Learned counsel also submitted that the 2nd

respondent has filed an affidavit to that effect as well.

            4.     Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions

submitted that, except this case, there is no other case

registered against the petitioner on the basis of similar

allegations made, but opposed the application for quashing

the case.

            5.     The counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, except this case there is no other case against the

Crl. M. C. No.1009 of 2014
                                  4

petitioners and the matter has been amicably settled. The

father of the first petitioner is seriously ill and on account of

the pendency of the warrant, he is not able to come to India.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

            6.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by CW1, who is the 2nd respondent herein

as the defacto-complainant, Alappuzha North Police has

registered a case against the petitioners as Crime

No.900/2011 of that police Station and after investigation,

Annexue-AI final report was filed before the court, which

was taken on the file as C.C.No.135/2013 and now pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Alappuzha. The

matter has been now settled between the accused persons

and     the    defacto-complainant/2nd     respondent.    Second

respondent filed an affidavit as Annexure-II, admitting these

facts and expressing his willingness to quash the

proceedings, as he has no grievance against them now.

Though on the basis of the allegations, it may appear that,

Crl. M. C. No.1009 of 2014
                                      5

there is a visa racket involved, but from the submission

made by the learned Public Prosecutor that, it is seen that

except this case no other case has been registered against

the petitioners of this nature, it can only be treated as a

promise to obtained visa, which has not been fulfilled and

later the amount has been paid and settled the claim.

            7.     It appears to be a civil nature. In the decision

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108 (SC)], the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:




      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.     Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

Crl. M. C. No.1009 of 2014
                                       6

      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




             8.     Considering the fact that the matter is of

civil colour and the matter has been settled between the

parties and there is no possibility of any conviction being

entered against the petitioners in the event of trial, in view

of the fact that the defato-complainant has settled the entire

claim and he will not support the case of the prosecution, I

                                    7

feel that, it is a fit case where the power under Section 482

can be invoked to quash the proceedings to honour the

settlement entered into between the parties. So the

application      is    allowed    and    further  proceedings      in

C.C.No.135/2013 (Crime No. 900/2011 of Alappuzha North

Police Station) on the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Alappuzha, as against the petitioners is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

immediately, for further necessary action.

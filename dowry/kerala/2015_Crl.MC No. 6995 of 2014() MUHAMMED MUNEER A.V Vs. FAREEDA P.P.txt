                  CRL. M.C. No.6995 of 2014
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 3rd day of February, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A4 in Crime No.990/14 of the

Mayyil Police Station, registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-II FIR in Crime No

No.990/14 of the Mayyil Police Station, and all further

proceedings based on it, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.Nos.6995 of 2014
                               -: 2 :-



more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The      defacto complainant,  who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.Nos.6995 of 2014
                               -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-II

FIR in Crime No No.990/14 of the Mayyil Police Station, and

all further proceedings based on it, are hereby quashed.

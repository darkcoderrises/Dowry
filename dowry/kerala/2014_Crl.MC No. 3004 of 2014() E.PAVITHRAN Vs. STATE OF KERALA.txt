             ------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Crl. M.C. No.3004 of 2014
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 13th day of June, 2014


                                     O R D E R

           This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in S.C.No.363/2012

pending before the Principal Sessions Court, Thalassery

(Special Court for Commission of Protection of Child Rights

Act) to quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called 'the Code').

           2.      It is alleged in the petition that the case was

registered against the petitioner as Crime No.4/2012 of

Payangadi police station of Kannur district as Annexure-A1

first information report and after investigation Annexure-2

final report was filed, alleging commission of the offence

under Section 341, 323, 294(b) of Indian Penal Code and

now it is pending before the Principal Sessions Court,

Thalassery, as S.C.No.363/2012. This was committed to the

Special Court, when the Principal Sessions Court was

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                    2

designated as Special Court for trying the offences,

affecting the child and child right under Section 25 of the

Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005. Now

the 2nd     respondent, who is the defacto-complainant has

become major and they are relatives as well. Now due to

the intervention of mediators and well-wishers, the matter

has been settled. Connected cases in respect of the same

incident between the parties were also settled and the same

were quashed by this court as per Annexure-A3 and A4

orders. No purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case. Since it affects the child right, compounding petition

could not be filed before the Special Court. Some of the

offences are non-compoundable in nature as well.                So they

have no other remedy except to approach this court,

seeking the following relief:

            "It is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble
      Court may be pleased to quash all further proceedings in
      S.C.No.363/2012 on the file of District and Sessions
      Court, Thalassery which is registered on the basis of
      crime No.4/2012 of Payangai police station. Otherwise
      the petitioner will be put to irreparable legally injury and
      hardship".

            3.    Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                 3

counsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled

between the parties and connected cases between the

parties were also settled. So the respondents 2 and 3 do

not want to prosecute the case in view of the settlement.

They have filed affidavit stating these facts as well.

            4.    The counsel for the petitioner also stated

that, in view of the settlement, conviction is not possible.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

            5.    The     learned    Public    Prosecutor,     on

instructions as directed by this court, submitted that, there

is no other case against the petitioner, but since it is a case

involving the child right, cannot be quashed invoking

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 3rd respondent, who is the father of

the 2nd respondent, while he was a child in respect of some

incident happened, Annexure-1 first information report was

registered as Crime No.4/2012 of Payangadi police station,

against the petitioner alleging offences under Section 341,

323, 294(b) of Indian Penal Code. After investigation,

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                              4

Annexure-2 final report was filed before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, and it was originally

taken on file before that court, later when Principal

Sessions Courts were designated as Special Courts for

trying the offences against the children or affecting their

right under Section 25 of the Commission for Protection of

Child Rights Act, 2005, this case was committed to the

Principal Sessions Court, where it was taken on file as

S.C.No.363/2012 and that is pending before that court. It is

seen from the allegations in the petition that, the petitioner

and the respondents 2 and 3 are neighbours and relatives

as well. There were some cases against each other, namely

C.C.No.246/2012 and 513/2012 pending between the

parties and on account of the intervention of mediators, the

difference of opinion between the parties have been settled

and they have decided to withdraw all the prosecutions.

Accordingly, on the basis of the applications filed by the

accused in C.C.No.246/2012 and C.C.No.513/12, both

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Payyannur, this court by Annexure-A3 and A4 order in

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                5

Crl.M.C.     No.1485/2014     and   1916/2014    quashed   the

proceedings against the petitioners in those cases. The 3rd

respondent herein is the defacto-complainant in one of the

case and the wife of the present petitioner is the defacto-

complainant in other case in those two cases. In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction in this

case. Further it is true that considering the fact that the

child abuse and rights of child are being violated,

legislature thought of providing a Special Court for trying

the offences against the child or child right. But when it is

a dispute between the relatives, in which a child is also

involved and on account of the intervention of mediators

and well-wishers, the entire dispute between the family

members have been resolved and they have decided to

withdraw all the prosecutions in order to bring harmony in

the family, then the pendency of criminal cases should not

be a hurdle for the same and the courts must always

promote such settlement to bring harmony in the family.

            7.    Further in this case, the 2nd respondent has

now become major and now he has no grievance against the

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                       6

petitioner and all of them are living in harmony as well.

            8.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
      Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
      crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
      offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.       Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                       7

      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             9.     In cases, where relatives are involved and on

account of some dispute in the family, some crimes have

been registered and if the matter has been settled in the

mediation held due to the intervention of well-wishers of the

family members of both parties and harmony has been

restored in the family on account of the settlement, then the

court must always promote such settlement and even if non-

compoundable offence have been committed, then that can

be quashed by the High Court by invoking the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

             10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, it is a dispute

between the family members and some other criminal cases

between the parties have already been quashed on account

of the settlement and there is no possibility of any

conviction on account of the settlement and proceeding

Crl. M.C.No.3004 of 2014
                                8

with the case will only be a wastage of judicial time, this

court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to

promote the settlement, which resulted in harmony in the

family.

            So the application      is allowed    and further

proceeding in S.C.No.363/2012 (Crime No.4/2012 of

Payangadi police station of Kannur district) pending before

the Principal Sessions Court, Thalassery, as against the

petitioner is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this

order to the concerned court, immediately for necessary

further action

in this regard.

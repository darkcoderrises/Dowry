                Crl.M.C.No.2602 of 2012
       -------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 16th day of November, 2012

                         O R D E R




       Petitioner is the accused in a pending case

numbered as C.C.No.14 of 2011, on the file of the

Judicial   Magistrate         of     the      First     Class,

Kothamangalam.       He is beng prosecuted for the

offence under Section 498 of the Indian Penal Code

{for short "the IPC"}, on a report filed by the Sub

Inspector    of    Police,      Kothamangalam           Police

Station. Crime in the above case was registered on

the complaint of party respondent, who is the wife

of the petitioner, alleging matrimonial cruelty

and harassment by him demanding dowry. She filed

the complaint before the magistrate imputing

some other offences as well against her husband,

Crl.M.C.No.2602 of 2012

                        :: 2 ::


and that complaint was referred to police for

investigation and report under Section 156(3) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure {for short "the

Code"}. That led to the registration of the crime.

After investigation of the crime, petitioner was

indicted of the offence under Section 498 of the

IPC. He has filed the above petition for quashing

the proceedings against him, under Section 482 of

the Code, stating that the parties have resolved

all   disputes     through   mediation.    Parallel

proceedings pending before the Family Court,

which too initiated at the instance of the wife, are

also settled on mutual terms agreed upon by the

parties, is his further case. Annexure A4 is the

compromise petition, filed before the Family

Court, in which the terms of compromise are made

mention of.     Learned counsel appearing for the

wife also submitted that in view of the settlement

Crl.M.C.No.2602 of 2012

                        :: 3 ::


arrived, she is no more interested or desirous of

prosecuting her husband. The Apex Court in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab {2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)} has

held    that    crime    cases,   involving    non-

compoundable offences too, where such offences

predominantly have civil flavour or arise out of

matrimonial disputes, they can be quashed by this

court invoking its inherent powers when there is a

settlement by parties giving a quietus to all

disputes, which could be treated as personal to

them.

        2. In the present case, evidently, the crime

was registered and the petitioner was prosecuted

on account of the matrimonial disputes with his

wife. Now that the parties have settled the matter,

I   find,    continuation     of the    prosecution

proceedings of the petitioner is not called for.

Further more, even if prosecution is continued on

Crl.M.C.No.2602 of 2012

                        :: 4 ::


account of settlement effected by the parties,

there is remote chance of it leading to conviction

of the petitioner. At best, it may give rise to only

wastage of time of precious time of the court.

Taking note of the above, criminal proceedings

against the petitioner/accused in C.C.No.14 of 2011

on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First

Class, Kothamangalam, are quashed under Section

482 of the Code.

        Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

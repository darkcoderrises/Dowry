                  ---------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015
                  ---------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 9th day of October, 2015


                            O R D E R


                The respondents herein are the accused Nos.2

and 3 in the CBI Crime No.RC 5(S)/2009/CBI/SCB/Chennai,

involving the offence punishable under Section 304B of the

Indian Penal Code.     The crime relates to the commission of

suicide by one Anitha Pathiyil, daughter of one Gopinathan who

initiated the prosecution by filing a complaint before the learned

Magistrate having jurisdiction.          The said complaint was

forwarded for investigation to the police under Section 156(3) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure. Later the investigation was

taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation as ordered by

this Court in W.P(C) No.4558/2009. During investigation these

two petitioners were granted pre-arrest bail by this Court as per

the order dated 12.7.2007 in B.A No.4184/2007, on certain

conditions. One of the conditions is that the accused shall not

leave India without prior permission of the learned Magistrate.

After thorough investigation, the CBI submitted final report

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, referring

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015              2

the crime on the ground that no material could be collected to

prove a case of dowry death.             The learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate was not inclined to accept the report, and

accordingly a further investigation was ordered by the Court

under Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C. Such investigation is now going

on, and the CBI has not reached anywhere in the crime

registered in 2007. Anitha Pathiyil committed suicide in 2004.

               2.      Now the CBI makes a request herein to cancel

the bail granted to the respondents on two grounds. One is that

effective interrogation of the accused is necessary in view of

certain materials collected by the CBI on a search made in the

house of the accused, and the other is that on certain occasions

the accused had gone abroad in violation of the condition

imposed by the Court and without obtaining permission from the

court.

               3.      On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the

materials, I find that the request of the CBI to cancel the bail as

such cannot be allowed. The prominent object of the CBI in

making such a request is effective interrogation of the accused

Nos.2 and 3 as part of the further investigation ordered by the

Court. Of course, violation of the bail condition is also alleged by

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015                3

the CBI.

               4.      It is well settled that once pre-arrest bail or

regular bail is granted to the accused during the investigation

process, and final report is submitted, the Court cannot cancel

the bail even for the purpose of further investigation under

Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C unless there are extraordinary

circumstances and compelling reasons. This is the legal position

settled by this Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court on many

occasions. In this case, I do not find any such compelling reason

or extraordinary circumstance for such an extreme course,

except that interrogation of the accused is required, or found

absolutely necessary by the CBI, on the basis of something

recently seized on search in their house. The CBI does not have

any explanation why such materials could not be seized at the

right stage in 2007 when investigation was vigorously in

progress.

               5.      There is yet another very important aspect. The

crime was registered in 2007, and now we are in 2015. It is

submitted that some investigation was made by the investigating

agency in California also during the relevant period. It is not

known what is the result of such investigation. Anyway, the

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015              4

investigating agency here is not the local police, but the CBI,

having access in all ways possible even to go abroad for the

purpose of investigation. It is really strange that the CBI has not

been able so far to go to California and to interrogate the first

accused as part of investigation. It is not known what materials

the CBI will collect by interrogating the accused Nos.2 and 3

when the main first accused stands not interrogated in any

manner for the last eight years.        Anyway, in the interest of

justice I find that the CBI can be given a limited permission to

interrogate the accused Nos.2 and 3, without cancelling their

bail.

               6.      Another ground urged by the CBI is that the

accused Nos.2 and 3 had gone abroad on some occasions in

violation of the condition imposed by this Court, or without

obtaining previous permission of the Court.         Evey condition

imposed by the court for bail will have an object to achieve.

Such conditions are always imposed by this Court and the courts

below in the interest of a fair investigation, or to ensure a

smooth, fair and effective investigation. Here also the accused

Nos.2 and 3 were prevented from going abroad, with the object

of    protecting       the  interest of the  prosecution, pending

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015         5

investigation. The said order was passed by this Court in 2007.

Conditions imposed by the courts for bail cannot be mechanically

enforced. When the court proceeds to enforce a condition, or

even to cancel the bail on the ground of violation of the

condition, the court's concern must always be whether the object

intended by the court in imposing such a condition stands

served. Here the condition imposed in 2007, still continues in

force even now in 2015. The first final report referring the crime

was submitted by the CBI long back. Practically and legally, the

conditions imposed by the court will cease to have effect once

final report is submitted. Anyway, the accused did not make an

application to lift the conditions, and so it continues in force

even now, when the further investigation is in progress.

However, as already observed the court's concern must be

whether the object intended by the court in imposing such a

condition stands served, or must have been served. I do not

think that the above condition cannot be rigorously imposed now

in 2015, because the first round of investigation is over, and it

culminated in a refer report. Further materials are yet to be

collected by the CBI for a supplemental final report. In such a

situation, this Court cannot cancel the bail simply on the ground

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015               6

that the accused went abroad after two years from the date on

which the condition was imposed by this Court. The learned

counsel for the accused submits that the accused in fact went

abroad after obtaining permission from the Court. Anyway, the

CBI does not have anything to prove that the accused in fact

went abroad without obtaining permission.                   However, as

observed earlier, this Court is not inclined to enforce                  the

condition quite mechanically. I find that on the said ground also

the bail granted to the accused cannot be cancelled.

               7.      As observed earlier, I find that it will suffice that

the CBI is granted permission to interrogate the accused Nos.2

and 3 as part of the further investigation process. The learned

counsel for the accused submits that the accused will definitely

co-operate with such process, and they will appear before the

investigating officer on the date specified by the investigating

officer.

               8.      In the result, this Crl.M.C is disposed of as

follows:

                         a)  The request of the petitioner

           (CBI) to       cancel  the bail      granted    to the

           respondents is disallowed.

Crl.M.C No.6164 of 2015           7

                        b) The   CBI   is   permitted  to

           interrogate the respondents (accused Nos.2 and

           3) on a day specified by the CBI, within one

           month from this date, notice of which shall be

           given to the accused.

                        c) The  interrogation process  as

           permitted by this Court shall be conducted

           between 10 am and 5 pm.

                 ----------------------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                 ---------------------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 7th April, 2014

                              O R D E R



      This Criminal Miscellaneous Case                is    filed by the

petitioner, who is the accused in C.C No. 858/2010 (Crime

No.307/2010 of Poovar police station) pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,Neyyattinkara for

quashing the proceedings in view of the settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Code').

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the

accused in C.C.No. 858/2010. The case was registered on the

basis of the statement given by the defacto complainant               1st

respondent      against the petitioner alleging offences under

Sections 451, 323 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code. After

investigation final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No. 858/2010        on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Neyyattinkara.

Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                                    2

      3. Now the matter has been settled between the parties.

The parties are neighbours. Due to                 the settlement, the

relationship between them has been restored. On account of

the settlement, defacto complainant and the other injured do

not want to prosecute the case any further. Since some of the

offences are non- compoundable in nature, he could not file

application    for   compounding        before the court below. No

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case. So                    he

has no other remedy          except to approach this Court seeking

the following relief:

             "For these and other grounds that may be urged at the time

             of hearing it is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court

             may   be pleased to quash Annexure A First         Information

             Report and Annexure B final report and further proceedings

             in C.C.No.858/2010 on the file of the Court of Judicial 1st

             Class Magistrate-II, Neyyattinkara in the interest of justice".

      4. The counsel for 1st and 2nd respondents appeared

through   counsel     and     submitted that      the matter has been

settled between the parties due to intervention of mediators

and their relationship has been restored. They do not want to

prosecute the case any further. They filed Annexure C and D

affidavits stating these facts.

Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                                  3




      5. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the case. So, he prayed for allowing the application.

      6. The learned        Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner and there is no criminal antecedents but

opposed the application.

      7. It is an admitted fact that    the   petitioner  is  the

accused in C.C.No. 858/2010 which was originated on the basis

of a statement given by defacto complainants/1st respondent

against the petitioner as Crime No.307/2010 alleging offences

under Sections 451, 323 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code.

After investigation final report was filed and it is now pending

as C.C. No.858/2010.

      8. Now the matter has been settled between the parties.

It is seen from affidavits and allegations in the petition that

the parties are friends and the incident occurred due to

misunderstanding between them which resulted in registration

of the crime and filing of the final report. The matter has been

Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                                      4

settled between the parties due to intervention of mediators.

On account of the settlement            original relationship between

them has been restored and the defacto complainant and the

other injured     do not want to prosecute the case. Further, on

account of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction

also, if the case is allowed to proceed with. The case is not a

case of public interest affecting public safety or affecting the

society at large. It is a private dispute              which resulted in

registration of the crime and filing of the final report.

     9. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

          the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

          arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

          partnership or such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

          family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

 Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                                       5

          of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

          continuation of criminal case would put accused to

          great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

          would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

          case   despite    full and   complete    settlement  and

          compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

          Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

          contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

          criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

          proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

          law despite settlement and compromise between the

          victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

          of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

          an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

          affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

          jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      10. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

also and considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and no public interest is involved and as

it is not a case of offence affecting the society at large and in

view of the settlement, the original relationship has been

 Crl.M.C. No. 1966 of 2014 - A
                                    6

restored between the parties and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as conviction will be remote and          it

will be wastage of judicial time, this Court feels that it is a fit

case where power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings           in order to promote the

settlement and restoration of relationship between the parties

and the pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the

same.

       So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No 858/2010 (Crime No.307/2010 Poovar police station)

pending before the          Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Neyyattinkara as against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to       communicate this order     to the

concerned court immediately.

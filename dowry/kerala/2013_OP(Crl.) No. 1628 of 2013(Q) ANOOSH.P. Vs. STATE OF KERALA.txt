                ----------------------------------------
                  O.P.(Crl.).No.1628 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 13th day of June, 2013

                            JUDGMENT

      The above Original Petition (Crl.) is filed praying inter

alia to call for the records from the court of the Additional

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam in C.C.No.830 of 2010 on

its file and issue a direction to record settlement, compromise

and compounding of the case and allow the 3rd respondent to

withdraw from the prosecution and give any further and

proper directions in the matter.

      2.   The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.909

of 2010 of Thripunithura Hill Palace Police Station for the

offence punishable under Section 498-A read with Section 34

of IPC.    The allegation against the petitioner and other

accused is that, they have tortured and harassed the de facto

complainant, who is the wife of the first petitioner demanding

more dowry.      The case of the petitioner is that, now the

O.P.(Crl.).No.1628 of 2013

                             :-2-:


dispute between the de facto complainant and the accused are

settled out of court and therefore the court below may be

directed to record the settlement and composition of the

offence and allowed the 3rd respondent to withdraw the

prosecution.

     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned counsel for the 3rd respondent. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor for the State.

     4.    From the facts discernible from the memorandum of

Writ Petition and from the materials produced along with it

can be seen that C.C.No.830 of 2010 is instituted in the court

of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam on the

basis of the police report in Crime No.909 of 2010 of the

Tripunithura Hill Palace Police Station for the offence

punishable under Section 498-A read with Section 34 of IPC.

The said Crime was registered on the basis of the complaint

preferred by the de facto complainant, who is the 3rd

O.P.(Crl.).No.1628 of 2013

                              :-3-:


respondent herein.        It appears that, the 3rd respondent

preferred the complaint against her own husband since there

was difference of opinion among the spouses and thus it can be

seen that the complaint was originated out of matrimonial

dispute.    It is the case of the petitioner that, during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled out of court

and now the petitioner as well as the 3rd respondent are

residing together as husband and wife. Therefore, according to

the petitioner and the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

proceedings pending against the petitioner before the court

below is sheer waste of time and abuse of process of the court.

     5.    The learned counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent

also submitted that, as the matter is settled out of court,

petitioner as well as the 3rd respondent are living together for

the last three years and the 3rd respondent has no intention to

proceed with the prosecution any further and no objection in

dropping the proceedings.

O.P.(Crl.).No.1628 of 2013

                             :-4-:


     6.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the husband and wife, who are respectively

the writ petitioner and the 3rd respondent, according to me, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement and give

effect of the settlement already arrived and to create an

atmosphere to continue their family life smoothly. The dictum

laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision reported

in   Jitendra     Raghuvanshi     and  Others     Vs.    Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013(1)KLD 817 (SC)],              also

attracted in the present case.    Therefore, according to me,

following the above decision and particularly in the light of the

fact that the matrimonial dispute already settled and the

parties to the dispute want a quietus of the criminal case also

and thus it is only just and proper to allow this Writ Petition

quashing all the proceedings pending against the petitioner

before the court below.

O.P.(Crl.).No.1628 of 2013

                              :-5-:


           In the result, this Original Petition (Crl.) is allowed

quashing     all  further  proceedings    pending   against    the

petitioner in C.C.No.830 of 2010 of the court of the Additional

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam.

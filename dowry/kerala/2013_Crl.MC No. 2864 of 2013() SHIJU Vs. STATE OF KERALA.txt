                  Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 12th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the   petitioners,  who     are    accused      Nos.1,   3 & 4 in

S.C.No.1631 of 2010 on the file of the Assistant Sessions

Court, Thiruvananthapuram which is a case instituted upon

the police report in Crime No.352 of 2009 of Valiyathura

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 323,

324, 506(ii), 308 & 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to call for the

records in Annexure-1 Charge Sheet now pending before the

Assistant Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram in S.C.No.1631

of 2010 in Crime No.352 of 2009 of Valiyathura Police Station

and quash all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The prosecution allegation is that, out of animosity

against the de facto complainant/3rd respondent, accused 1 to

4 on 30/06/2009 at about 7.30 p.m. came to Thoppinakam

Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
                            :-2-:


junction at Valiyathura ward in Muttathara Village in a maruthi

car and attacked the de facto complainant and accordingly he

sustained injuries and thereby the accused committed the

offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 506(ii), 308 & 34

of IPC. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

Section 308 of IPC was incorporated with a view to make it as

a Sessions Case. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that

the injuries sustained by the de facto complainant are only

incised wounds. Now the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court between themselves and the de

facto complainant,     who is the 3rd respondent herein.

Annexure-2 is the affidavit sworn into by the de facto

complainant/3rd respondent.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 3rd respondent.    I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
                              :-3-:


matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-2 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 323, 324, 506(ii),

308 & 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
                                    :-4-:


and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

3rd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioners/ accused in

the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

        depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

        no category can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

Crl.M.C.No.2864 of 2013
                             :-6-:


matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 Charge Sheet and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in S.C.No.1631 of 2010 on the file of

the Assistant Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram.

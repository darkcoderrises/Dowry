                      Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 29th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This Criminal Miscellaneous                 Case is         filed by the sole

accused in     Crime No.50/2013                 of      Pettah       police station,

Thiruvananthapuram district to quash the proceedings on the

basis of a settlement under                 Section         482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that petitioner is the sole

accused in Crime No.50/2013 of Pettah police station,

Thiruvananthapuram distrcit, which was registered on the basis

of a statement given by the second respondent as defacto

complainant alleging commission of offences under Section 307

of the Indian penal Code on the allegation that petitioner who

is the father of the defacto complainant had attempted to murder

wife of the petitioner shown as second respondent herein by

inflicting injuries on her.         Now due to intervention of family

members and well wishers, the dispute between the petitioner

and the second respondent has been resolved and now they are

living together under the same roof happily.                         In view of the

Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013                  2

settlement, no purpose will be served by allowing the

investigation to continue            as even if ultimately final report is

filed, no conviction will be possible and it will be only a

wastage of judicial time to allow the case to continue. Since it

is in the crime stage and offence alleged is non compoundable

in nature, neither the police nor the court before which the

case is ultimately going to be tried will drop the proceedings or

accept       the compounding.          So the petitioner     has no other

remedy except to approach this Court seeking the following

relief:

                      In the    circumstances    above, it is

              humbly prayed that      the  compromise    may

              kindly be accepted and the proceedings under

              Annexure A pending as Cr.50/13 on the file of

              the     Additional  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate

              Court,    Thiruvananthapuram   for  the offence

              under Sec.307      I.P.C may be     quashed in

              exercise of the inherent powers of this Court.




        3. Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled               and it is a family

dispute which resulted in quarrel              and filing of the crime and

now they are living together happily under the same roof and

Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013              3

respondents 2 and 3 do not want to prosecute the petitioner

who is the husband of the second respondent and the father of

the third respondent. The counsel for the petitioner submitted

that in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

keeping the case on file.

        4. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor on

the ground that offence under Section 307 of the Indian Penal

Code is incorporated and it is in the crime stage.

        5. Heard both sides.

         6. It is      an admitted fact that  the  petitioner is the

husband of           the second respondent and   father of the third

respondent. It is also an admitted fact that on account of some

incident had happened between the petitioner and the second

respondent in which the second respondent sustained injuries

and she was taken to hospital by the third respondent and on

the basis of the statement given by the third respondent

Anenxure-A First Information Report was registered as Crime

No.50/2013           of  Pettah police station against the petitioner

alleging      commission of     offence under   Section   307 of the

Indian Penal Code and the petitioner was arrested           and after

detention in jail for sometime, he was released on bail. Now

Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013                  4

due to the intervention of mediators and family members, the

dispute between respondents 2 and 3 and the petitioner has

been settled and they are now residing together under the

same roof          happily. In view of the         settlement, there is no

possibility of the defacto complainant or the second respondent

or the witnesses          co-operate with the investigation so as to

enable the investigating officer to file final report in the matter

and even if final report is filed on the basis of the evidence

collected, in view of the settlement, they will not support the

case of the prosecution and conviction in such case is remote.

Further, it cannot be said to be a case of public interest. In fact

the quarrel on account of the matrimonial dispute resulted in

filing of the case which has now been settled and they are

living happily under the same roof on account of the settlement.

        7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013                   5

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite  full and   complete    settlement  and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


        8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact it is a dispute between the husband

and wife and which has been settled in the mediation held at

Crl.M.C.No.1623 of 2013                 6

the instance of the family members and well wishers of both

the parties and on account of the settlement they are living

together happily under the same roof and possibility of

conviction even if it is allowed to               continue, the investigation

and filing of the final report will be remote, this Court feels

that this is a fit case where the power under Section                 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings to promote the settlement and harmony in the

family life and the pendency of this case should not be a

hurdle for the same.


        9. So, the application is allowed. Further proceedings in

Crime No.50/2013 of Pettah Police station, Thiruvananthapuram

district as against the petitioner is quashed.

        Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately so as to inform the Pettah police

station for necessary further action in this regard.

                Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 2nd day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the

instance of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2

in Crime No. 348 of 2013 of Kadavanthra Police Station]

for the offences punishable under Sections 324, 307 r/w

34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the all other

proceedings in annexure A-1, F.I.R in Crime No.348 of

2013 of Kadavanthra Police Station as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

30.03.2013 at about 11.45 p.m, the accused persons in

furtherance of their common intention attacked the de

facto complainant and caused injuries on his chest and

thus committed the offences punishable under Sections

324 and 304 r/w 34 of I.P.C. The case of the petitioners

is that the matter is settled between himself and        the

second respondent and who is the injured and de facto

complainant. The learned Public Prosecutor has pointed

Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013         2


out that the offence involved under Section 307 since

there is a penetrating injury on the de facto complainant

as a result of which the muscles protruded out. But it is

relevant to note that the petitioners as well as the second

respondent are working together and they are residing in

the very same room and now, the case of the petitioners

are that the matter is settled out of court.

           3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the second respondent. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

           4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above crime,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

           5. The learned counsel for the second respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent and on the basis of Annexure-III affidavit of

the second respondent          submitted   that the above

Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013            3


respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

she has no grievance against them.

           6.    I    have carefully considered the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

           7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only Sections 324, 307 r/w

34 of I.P.C which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that

Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013                4


the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them.                 In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme

Court has held as follows:-




                   "57. The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus: the
           power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of
           its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
           from the power given to a criminal court for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
           no statutory limitation but it has to be
           exercised    in  accord    with    the   guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
           ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
           process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or
           F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
           victim have settled their dispute would depend
           on the facts and circumstances of each case
           and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
           flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
           arising      from      commercial,      financial,
           mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of

Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013             5


           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
           disputes where the wrong is basically private
           or personal in nature and the parties have
           resolved their entire dispute. In this category
           of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the
           compromise between the offender and victim,
           the possibility of conviction is remote and
           bleak and continuation of criminal case would
           put accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to him
           by not quashing the criminal case despite full
           and complete settlement and compromise with
           the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances          involved   in   the   present     case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2136 of 2013          6


Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A1 F.I.R and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in Crime No.348 of 2013           of

Kadavanthra Police Station and all further proceedings

thereto.

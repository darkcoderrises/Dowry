     ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No. 1457 of 2014
     ==============================
         Dated this, the 12th day of March, 2014.


                          O R D E R



      This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

Crime No.1534/13 of Tirur Police Station of Malappuram

District, to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No.1534/13 of Tirur Police

Station which was registered on the basis of the statement

given by the de facto complainant who is the second

respondent herein alleging offence under Section 420 read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The matter has been settled

between the parties and there is no disputes subsisting

between the parties.    The settlement was arrived at on the

basis of the intervention of mediators and friends. No purpose

will be served by proceeding with the investigation. Since it is

in the investigation stage, neither the police nor the court will

drop the proceedings. So, they have no other option except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

Crl.M.C.No. 1457 of 2014         :  2 :




      "To quash the Annexure.1, FIR and consequential proceedings in

crime No.1534/2013 of Tirur Police Station registered on 26.10.2013, in

the interest of justice and Equity."

      3.     Second respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he has no objection in quashing the proceedings.

The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of

the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding with

the investigation and he prayed for allowing the application.

      4.     Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioners and they have no criminal

background but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by second respondent who is the de facto

complainant, the Tirur police has registered a case against the

petitioners alleging offences under Section 420 read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.            Investigation is in the

primitive stage. But, in the meantime, the petitioners and the

de facto complainant had settled the claim due to the

intervention of mediators and that is evidenced by Annexure

Crl.M.C.No. 1457 of 2014          :   3 :

A2 settlement deed and A3 affidavit of the de facto

complainant. Since it is a monitory dispute and that has been

settled between the parties, no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well.

       6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
     the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
     offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
     plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
     in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
     secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
     process of any Court.       In what cases power to quash the
     criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
     where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
     depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
     category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
     power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
     gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
     depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
     be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
     and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
     not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
     Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
     relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
     Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
     while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
     for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
     the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
     civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
     quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
     financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions
     or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc;
     or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
     personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
     dispute.   In this category of case, High Court may quash

Crl.M.C.No. 1457 of 2014           :   4 :

     criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
     between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
     remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
     accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
     injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
     case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
     the victim.    In other words, the High Court must consider
     whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
     to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
     criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
     law despite settlement and compromise between the victim
     and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
     appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer to
     the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
     well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



       7.     Considering the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is purely a money

transaction which has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of mediators and no purpose will be served in

allowing the investigation to continue as the de facto

complainant will not support the investigating agency to

proceed with the investigation and file final report against the

petitioners in view of the settlement, this court feels that it is

a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings as proceeding with the investigation will only

amount to wastage of judicial time as well as the time of the

investigation officer.

        So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crl.M.C.No. 1457 of 2014    : 5 :

Crime No.1534/13 of Tirur Police Station against the

petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this

order to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur, to

inform the concerned police station about the order for

necessary further action.

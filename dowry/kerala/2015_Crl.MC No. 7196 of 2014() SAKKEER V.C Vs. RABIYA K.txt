                  CRL. M.C. No.7196 of 2014
           ...............................................................
            Dated this the 16th day of January, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A4 in Crime No.556/2012 pending

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Thalasserry

registered for the offence punishable under Section 498A

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting all further proceedings in

C.C.828/2014 pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's

Court, Thalasserry, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

CRL.M.C.No.7196 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.No.7196 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 1st

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in C.C.828/2014 pending before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Thalasserry, based on Crime

No.556/2012 are hereby quashed.

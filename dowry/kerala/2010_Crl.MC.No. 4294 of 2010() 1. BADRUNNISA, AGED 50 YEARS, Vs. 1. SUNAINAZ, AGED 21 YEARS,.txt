          CRL.M.C.No. 4294   OF 2010
          ===========================

    Dated this the 22nd day of October,2010

                     ORDER


    Petitioners  are  the  accused   and  first

respondent  the   de   facto   complainant   in

C.C.511/2010 on the file of Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Kasaragod.  First respondent filed

Annexure II complaint before Chief Judicial

Magistrate,     Kasaragod     alleging     that

petitioners,  along  with  the   first  accused

therein, the husband of the first respondent

committed the offence under section 498A read

with section 34 of Indian Penal Code.   It was

sent for investigation under section 156(3) of

Code of Criminal Procedure.   Crime 12/2009 of

Manjeshwar Police Station was registered. After

investigation Annexure III final report was

submitted  as  against  the  husband     alone,

stating  that  there  is  no  material  against

Crl.M.C.4294/2010             2

others and deleting       petitioners from the array of

the accused.         The learned Magistrate has taken

cognizance of the offence under section 498A, 323,

and 324 read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code

on    Annexure     III  final  report  as  C.C.233/2009.

First respondent filed Annexure I complaint as

against       petitioners  incorporating  paragraph  11,

which was not there originally in Annexure II

complaint stating that petitioners also tortured

and     harassed     her  demanding   dowry.     Learned

Magistrate after conducting inquiry under section

202 of Code of Criminal Procedure took cognizance

of the offence as C.C.511/2010.        This petition is

filed     under    section  482  of  Code  of   Criminal

Procedure to quash the cognizance taken.

      2.         Learned  counsel  appearing   for   the

petitioners was heard.

      3.    The argument of the learned counsel is that

when learned Magistrate has taken cognizance on

Annexure III report accepting the final report

whereunder after investigation the Investigating

Crl.M.C.4294/2010             3

Officer has reported that there is no material to

show     that     petitioners  committed  any   offence,

learned Magistrate should not have taken cognizance

on Annexure I complaint, which could only be a

second       complaint   which  is   not   maintainable.

Learned       counsel  also   argued  that  when   after

investigation, no material was disclosed as against

petitioners, learned Magistrate should not have

taken cognizance of the offence on Annexure I

complaint.

      4.     On hearing the learned counsel, I cannot

agree with the submission that for the reason that

Annexure        II  final   report  was   accepted   and

cognizance was taken       against the husband,  learned

Magistrate cannot take cognizance of the offence

against petitioners on a protest complaint filed by

the first respondent he is satisfied of a prima

facie case.         When a final report is submitted

stating that one of the accused committed the

alleged offence,       no notice will be issued by the

learned Magistrate,        to the de facto complainant.

Crl.M.C.4294/2010             4

So    first respondent has no opportunity to oppose

the findings or        acceptance of Annexure III final

report as such.         In Annexure I complaint first

respondent       specifically alleged the ingredients of

the offence as against the petitioners.           It is

after satisfying on the inquiry conducted under

section 202 of Code of Criminal Procedure, learned

Magistrate has taken cognizance.       It cannot be said

that cognizance taken is illegal.       Petitioners are

at liberty to raise all the contentions including

the absence of specific allegations in Annexure II

complaint        originally   filed       against    the

petitioners.        Petitioners are entitled to cross

examine the witnesses to be examined under section

244 of Code of Criminal Procedure and seek an order

of    discharge    under   section  245(1) of   Code  of

Criminal       Procedure.     If  petitioners  file   an

application to dispense with their presence for the

purpose of claiming discharge under section 245(1)

of Code of Criminal Procedure or recording the

evidence under section 244 of Code of Criminal

Crl.M.C.4294/2010      5

Procedure, learned Magistrate not to insist for

their presence.

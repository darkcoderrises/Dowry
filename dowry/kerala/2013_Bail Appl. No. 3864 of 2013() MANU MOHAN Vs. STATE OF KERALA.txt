            -------------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 6th day of June, 2013


                                  ORDER



      Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.665 of 2013 of

Viyoor Police Station, Thrissur registered for offences punishable

under Sections 498 A, 386 and 506 r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal

Code. They have filed the above application for pre-arrest bail

under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The above

crime was registered on a private complaint filed by the wife of

first petitioner before the magistrate and it being referred to

police for investigation and report. De facto complainant has got

impleaded as additional second respondent in the above

proceeding.

      2.    I heard the learned counsel for petitioner, second

respondent and also learned Public Prosecutor. Second petitioner

is the brother of first petitioner and third petitioner, mother of

B.A No.3864/2013                  2




second petitioner.    All the three petitioners have been falsely

implicated in the crime by de facto complainant on baseless

allegations, is the submission of counsel. De facto complainant is

involved in several crimes and she has strong criminal

propensities, is the further submission of counsel relying on

Annexure A1, copy of the order passed in an application moved

by that complainant with another when they were proceeded as

accused in a crime. Petitioners are prepared to co-operate with

investigation of the crime and also abide by any condition

imposed by this court, is the further submission of counsel to urge

for granting them the discretionary relief of anticipatory bail.

      3. Opposing the application vehemently, learned counsel for

second respondent contended that matrimonial cruelty was

inflicted by first petitioner, and he was aided and assisted by

other petitioners in such heinous acts against the de facto

complainant.      Demanding dowry, she was harassed both

physically and mentally, is the further submission of counsel. She

was subjected to assault by first petitioner and his relatives and,

she suffered grave injuries in one such incident which took place

B.A No.3864/2013                   3




beside the residential building of first petitioner on 04.04.2013, is

the further submission of counsel. Petitioners are not entitled to

the discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail, is the further submission.

     4.     Learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions

reports that third petitioner proceeded as one among the accused

has been removed, and, now the investigation is being continued

only against the other two accused in the crime. Case diary has

been produced for my perusal. After looking into the case diary

with reference to the materials so far gathered by the

investigating agency and also the submissions made by learned

counsel for petitioners and also second respondent, I find that

arrest and custodial interrogation of petitioners 1 and 2 may not

be required for a fair investigation of the crime. Though grave

allegations are imputed in the complaint filed by de facto

complainant, having regard to the surrounding circumstances and

also that the crime has been registered on account of matrimonial

disputes prevailing between first petitioner and de facto

complainant, I find, custodial interrogation of petitioners 1 and 2

who are proceeded as accused can be avoided.                  However,

B.A No.3864/2013                   4




petitioners 1 and 2 have to co-operate with investigation of the

crime.

                   In the event of arrest of petitioners 1 and 2
             in connection with the above crime by police,
             they are directed to be released on bail on their
             executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- each with one
             solvent surety for the like sum.

                   Petitioners 1 and 2 shall co-operate with
             investigation of the crime and report before the
             investigating officer as and when directed.

      No further order is required in the case of third petitioner

since it is stated she has been removed from the array of

accused.

      Petition is allowed.

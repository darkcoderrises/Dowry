                        JUDGMENT

RAJAN, J.

      This appeal is filed by the husband of the 1st

respondent against the judgment passed by the Family

Court, Alappuzha directing him to pay maintenance to the

2nd respondent.

      2. The petition for maintenance was filed by the

respondents under section 7 of the Family Courts Act. The

case of the respondents in the Family Court was that the

marriage between the 1st respondent and the appellant was

solemnized on 16-5-1999 as per custom prevailing their

community. In that wedlock,the 2nd respondent was born on

17-8-2004. At the time of the marriage 75 sovereigns of gold

ornaments and Rs.3 lakhs were given. Out of 75 sovereigns

Mat.Appeal 615/2012           2

of gold ornaments, 45 sovereigns of gold ornaments were

taken away by the appellant for his sister's marriage. The

patrimony of Rs.3 lakhs was also misappropriated for

purchasing property in the name of the appellant. The 1st

respondent was subjected to cruelty demanding of dowry,

which lead to police interference also. Due to the

harassment by the appellant, she left the company of the

appellant in January, 2006. He has neglected to maintain

her and the 2nd respondent. The 1st respondent claimed

Rs.7,000/- per mensum from January, 2006 and            2nd

respondent claimed Rs.3,000/- per mensum. She claimed

Rs.3,36,000/- towards arrears of maintenance for 48 months

from January, 2006 to December, 2009 and Rs.1,22,000/-

towards arrears of maintenance to the 2nd respondent.

       3. The husband resisted the above facts in the Family

Court by filing written objection and contended that the 1st

respondent left his company without any reasonable excuse

and she is not eligible for any amount as maintenance. She

filed O.P.752/07 for recovery of money and OP 753/07 for

Mat.Appeal 615/2012              3

divorce against the appellant. C.C.853/2008 is also pending

against him. All her gold ornaments were kept in her locker

while both of them residing together till 17-12-2006. The 1st

respondent employed as an Assistant in Cochin University

and has been drawing Rs.18,000/- per mensum. She has 36

cents of landed property and building from which she would

be getting income of Rs.15,000/- per mensum.           She has

claimed maintenance only as pocket money.              She has

account with Federal Bank, Mannanchery and having

permanent fixed deposits in her name and the 2nd

respondent has deposits in Vijaya Bank, Ernakulam. The

appellant      was   sending   money     to   the   respondents

periodically and using this the 1st respondent was leading a

luxurious life. The 2nd respondent is a student but the 1st

respondent is extorting money for him. Therefore, she is

not entitled to get maintenance.

            4.     Now the point that arises for consideration is

whether the maintenance given to the child is sustainable in

law.    Both parties admitted the marriage, which was

Mat.Appeal 615/2012          4

solemnized        on 16.5.1999   at   Falcon    Auditorium,

Mannancherry as per Muslim Customary rites. While they

were living together in the matrimonial house and on

17.8.2004, the 2nd respondent born to them, who is now

residing with the mother.         Gradually their marital

relationship became strained and the 1st respondent filed

O.P.No.752/2007      for    recovery    of    money     and

O.P.No.753/2007 for divorce. During the pendency of the

above petitions, PW1 approached the lower court for

getting maintenance for herself and her child. PW1 claimed

Rs.7,000/- for her and Rs.3,000/- for her child. Her case is

that the appellant CPW1 is working in the M.G University

and getting Rs.22,600/- per month.    CPW1 contended that

the 1st respondent is employed as Assistant in Cochin

University and getting Rs.8,000/- per mensum and she is

not entitled for any maintenance. PW1 also claimed arrears

of maintenance from 2006 onwards. The matrimonial

relationship between the appellant and the 1st respondent

Mat.Appeal 615/2012           5

were got divorced and both of them are living separately.

After the divorce, the 1st respondent remarried. CPW1 in

the trial court, admitted his willingness to maintain his

child. Ext.B1 is the certificate received from St. Mary's

Residential School, Poonthoppu. His child need Rs.3,000/-

per mensum for maintenance and also he is ready to pay

arrears to him from January 2006 onwards, which comes to

Rs.1,22,000/-. He already paid Rs.76,600/-. Subsequently,

the lower court awarded Rs.3,000/- per mensum for

maintenance to the child and also arrears of maintenance

of Rs.55,400/-. Now the 1st respondent, who was remarried

is not eligible for any maintenance from her previous

husband. The trial court considered this point and allowed

Rs.3,000/- as maintenance to the 2nd respondent and also

Rs.55,400/- towards arrears of maintenance to the 2nd

respondent. We do not find any illegality or irregularity in

the above order. No circumstances are brought out to

increase the quantum of compensation granted to the 2nd

respondent.

Mat.Appeal 615/2012            6

          There is no merit in the appeal and it is dismissed

accordingly.

                        Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

             Dated this the 1st day of September, 2014.


                                     O R D E R



         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 7 in C.C. No. 123/2014 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Hosdurg and accused Nos. 8

to 10 in C.C No. 57/2014 of the Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod

which cases were instituted upon a police report in Crime No.

744/2013 of Neeleswaram Police Station for offences punishable

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452,323, 324 and and Sec. 354 read

with Sec. 149 of IPC, with a prayer to quash all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in the above Cases, as the matter

is settled out of court.       Since the petitioners 8 to 10 were minors

at the time of commission of the offence, the proceedings are

pending before the Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod.

Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

                                 :-2-:

         2.      The allegations in the above case is that       the

petitioners/accused Nos. 1 to 10 in furtherance of their common

intention to attack the de facto complainant and his wife, formed

themselves an unlawful assembly and trespassed into the house of

the Ist respondent and attacked       them using  dangerous weapons

and outraged the modesty of the 2nd respondent, and, now the case

of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of Court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

respondents 1 and 2 /de facto complainant and his wife. I have also

heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.             Therefore, continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is an abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for respondents 1 and 2 , who on

the basis of specific instruction received from them, submitted that

the above respondents, who are the de facto complainants does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and they have

Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

                                :-3-:

no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case

are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452,323, 324 and and Sec.

354 read with Sec. 149 of IPC which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for respondents 1 and 2,

it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived at between them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

                                      :-4-:

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57.     The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
          in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
          from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
          offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
          of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal
          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
          offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
          the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
          be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
          commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
          criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
          remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
          accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
          would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

                                   :-5-:

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

         8.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case, and particularly,

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid down in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court

to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.                         It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court,

in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have

any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed,               all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in              C.C. No. 123

Crl.M.C.No. 5026 of 2014

of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate - II, Hosdurg and

C.C. No. 57 of 2014 of Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod are

quashed.                      .

      Dated this the 1st day of September,2014.

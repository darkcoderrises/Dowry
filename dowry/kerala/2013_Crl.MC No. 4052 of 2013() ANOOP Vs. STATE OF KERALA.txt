                 Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013

                           ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.2956/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam which is a

case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 294(b) r/w

Section 149 of IPC., with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR

dated 2/2/2012, registered by Ernakulam Central Police and

Annexure A2, the charge sheet dated 8/3/2012, pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam

as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The gist of the prosecution case is that on

02.02.2012 at 2.45 pm, the petitioners herein who were the

members of Students Federation of India, in Maharajas College

Ernakulam being aware of the fact that they were rendering

into an unlawful assembly, used force and violence and

attacked the 2nd respondent who was a member of the Kerala

Students Union and there by caused injury to him.           The

incident happened at Malayalam Hall in Maharajas College

Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
                              2

Ernakulam. Thus, according to the prosecution the accused has

committed the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,

323, 324, 294(b) r/w Section 149 of IPC. Now according to the

petitioners and the second respondent as they are studying of

the very same institution, settled the disputes subsequently

and the second respondent does not interest in prosecute the

above case against the petitioners     and to that effect the

second respondent defacto complainant has sworn into

Annexure-A3 affidavit

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
                                3

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 294

(b) r/w Section 149 of IPC, which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
                                       4

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                   "57.   The position that emerges from the

           above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

           power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

           inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

           the power given to a criminal court for compounding

           the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

           power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

           the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

           secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

           the process of any Court. In what cases power to

           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

           may be exercised where the offender and victim

           have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

           and circumstances of each case and no category can

           be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But    the    criminal    cases    having

           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

           stand on different footing for the purposes of

           quashing, particularly the offences arising from

           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

           or such like transactions or the offences arising out

           of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

           disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved

Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
                                     5

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

Crl.M.C.No.4052 of 2013
                                6

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In   the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexures-A1 and A2       and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.C.No.2956/2012 of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam.

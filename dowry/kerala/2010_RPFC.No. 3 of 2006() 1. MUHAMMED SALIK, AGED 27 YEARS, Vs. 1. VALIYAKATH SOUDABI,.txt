      This is an appeal preferred by the husband against the

order directing him to pay Rs.1,500/- as maintenance to the

wife. The unfortunate couple got married and the matrimonial

relationship subsisted for a period of six months. It is the case

of the wife that the mother of the husband started demanding

dowry and used to illtreat her and did not provide her any food

thus making her life miserable. According to her she tolerated

the same for a period of six months and on account of

unavoidable circumstances left the matrimonial home.         The

husband would contend the wife on her on accord had left the

house.    When the evidence of the wife and husband are

weighed it can be seen that the case spoken to by the wife

appears to be more probable and acceptable and therefore she

had the reason to live separately from the husband. So far as

the quantum is concerned the husband admittedly is only a

coolie. Though it is submitted that the wife is having some

R.P.(F.C.) NO. 228     OF 2006
                               -:2:-

other work it is not proved. One may not get labour work on

all the days in a month and wage rate per day varies from

Rs.100 to 200 in different parts of the State. So taking into

consideration the entire circumstances and also the fact that

the husband has to maintain himself and the mother I feel in

the fitness of things the amount can be reduced by Rs.200/-

thereby making the payable amount at Rs.1,300/-. Therefore

the revision is partly allowed and the husband is directed to

pay a maintenance of Rs.1,300/- to the wife from 3.11.2003.

     R.P.(F.C.) is disposed of accordingly.

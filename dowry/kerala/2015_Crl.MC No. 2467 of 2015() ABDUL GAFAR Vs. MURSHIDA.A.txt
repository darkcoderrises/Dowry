                     Crl.M.C.No.2467 Of 2015
          --------------------------------------------------
           DATED THIS THE 28th DAY OF APRIL, 2015

                               ORDER

       Petitioners are the accused 1 to 5 in Crime No.190/2015 of

Chandera Police Station, Kasaragod District. The offences alleged

against the petitioners are under Sections 498A read with section

34 of the Indian Penal Code. Now, it is submitted on behalf of the

petitioners that the entire disputes between the petitioners and the

first respondent have already been settled and the first respondent

has also sworn to an affidavit which is produced along with Crl.M.C.

as Annexure A4. Therefore, the prayer in this Crl.M.C. is to quash

the entire proceedings in Crime No.190/2015 of Chandera Police

Station.

      2.   Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned

counsel appearing for the first respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor for the second respondent.

      3.   In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

Crl.M.C.No.2467/15                 -2-


inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given

to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section

320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is of wide

plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz.; (i) to

secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process

of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the

offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on

the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be

prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

Crl.M.C.No.2467/15               -3-


or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on

a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where

the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of

cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,

because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,

the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

Crl.M.C.No.2467/15                -4-


proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed offences punishable under Section 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      5.     Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the petitioners and the first respondent has already

been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the first

respondent has also stated that the first respondent does not

want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.

The first respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this

Court as Annexure A4 in this regard.

      6.     In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings      pending   against    the   petitioners    in  Crime

Crl.M.C.No.2467/15              -5-


No.190/2015 of Chandera Police Station, Kasaragod District can

be quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles

laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in Crime No.190/2015 of Chandera Police Station,

Kasaragod District against the petitioners is quashed.

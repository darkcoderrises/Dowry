                    Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014
                  ---------------------------------
            Dated this the 13th day of October, 2014.

                             O R D E R


      Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.786/2010

of Aranmula Police Station registered for offences under

Sections 447, 294(b), 506(ii) and 34 Indian Penal Code. The

2nd respondent is the defacto complainant. The 1st petitioner is

a close relative of the defacto complainant. The allegations

raised in the crime is that on 13.8.2010 at about 11:10 pm

due to the prior enmity between the sister of the 1st petitioner,

petitioners came to the house of the defacto complainant and

abused defacto complainant and used obscene words and

defacto complainant has been made to suffer mental injuries.

After registration of the crime and completion of investigation,

final report was filed which is now pending as C.C.No.324/2010

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Pathanamthitta. It is submitted that the petitioners and 2nd

respondent have discussed the matter and have arrived at an

amicable settlement of the matter and that the 2nd respondent

has no further interest to continue the case against the

                              ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

petitioners. As stated, petitioners and 2nd respondent are in

good amiable terms and that the 2nd respondent has sworn to

affidavit dated 10.10.2014 stating the aforementioned aspects

regarding settlement and that she has no interest to continue

the above said case against the petitioners and that the

incident occurred due to family dispute and that she has no

objection to quash the proceedings against the petitioners in

the aforementioned impugned criminal proceedings etc. It is

submitted that the parties have amicably settled the disputes

between them and that further continuance of the impugned

criminal proceedings based on such personal disputes is not

warranted.    It is in the background of these facts and

circumstances that the aforementioned Crl.M.C has been filed

seeking to quash the impugned criminal proceedings.

      2.   The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.P.V.Dileep

has taken notice for the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent State of

Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri. Ajith Murali, learned counsel for the

petitioners,  Sri.P.V.Dileep, learned  counsel   for the  2nd

                                ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the

1st respondent State of Kerala.

      4.   The   learned    counsel   for  the   petitioners  has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.P.V.Dileep, learned counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent has submitted, on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by the 2nd respondent, that the 2nd

respondent has amicably settled the disputes with the

petitioners as stated above and that she has no objection in

the quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that

the complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners as she has no grievance against

                              ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

them and that she will not raise any dispute/complaint in

future if the prayer for quashing the impugned criminal

proceedings is allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that

the court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of

the law well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature and not much element of public interest is involved.

The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such offences

are involved, the real disputants to the controversy, which has

led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have actually

arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the 2nd

respondent,    it   is   clear   to   the   Court    that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

                                 ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

arrived at by them. In this connection, it is relevant to note

the decision of the Apex Court in the case between Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri)

160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC),

wherein the Supreme Court has held as follows in para 61

thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                 "61. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus: the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

         from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)

         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.

         In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

         exercised where the offender and victim have

         settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category

         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But  the   criminal    cases   having

                                 ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

         overwhelmingly    and    pre-dominatingly    civil

         flavour stand on different footing for the

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,

         civil, partnership or such like transactions or

         the offences arising out of matrimony relating

         to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

         wrong is basically private or personal in nature

         and the parties have resolved their entire

         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the

         offender and victim, the possibility of conviction

         is remote and bleak and continuation of

         criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

         would be caused to him by not quashing the

         criminal    case  despite    full and   complete

         settlement     and   compromise       with    the

         victim........"



In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in

2014 (8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR

426 (SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

            "When the High Court is convinced that the
      offences are entirely personal in nature and, therefore,
      do not affect public peace or tranquility and where it

                                  ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5743 Of 2014

      feels that quashing of such proceedings on account of
      compromise would bring about peace and would secure
      ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307

r/w Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      8. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case,

it is seen that the impugned criminal proceedings have arisen

consequent     to   certain    personal     disputes   between the

petitioners and the 2nd respondent due to some family dispute

and they have arrived at a harmonious settlement of such

disputes whereby it has also been agreed to terminate the

criminal proceedings. Hence following decisions of the Apex

Court cited supra, this Court is inclined to hold that the

Crl.M.C. can be allowed by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and impugned Annexure-

A final report/charge sheet which arose out of Crime

No.786/2010 of Aranmula Police Station which is now pending

as C.C.No.324/2010 on the file of the judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta and all further proceedings

taken thereon stands quashed. The petitioner shall produce

as well as before the Station House Officer, Aranmula Police

Station, Pathanamthitta District.

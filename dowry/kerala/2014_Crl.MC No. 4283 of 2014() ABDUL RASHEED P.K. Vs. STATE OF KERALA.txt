                 Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 1st day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in Crime

No.458 of 2013 of Vidya Nagar Police Station for the

offences punishable under Section 23 of Juvenile Justice

Act, 2000 and section 324 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure A final report in the above crime, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.  The allegation in the above case is that the

accused has beaten the de facto complainant with his hand

on his face and assaulted him using glass beading cable on

the reason that the de facto complainant has passed urine

in the sleeping bed and caused disrespect in the mosque by

playing in the mosque for the last one week prior to

Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                               2

31.7.2013 and thereby the accused committed the offence

as alleged by the prosecution.        Now, the case of the

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against him.

Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                                 3

         6.       I   have carefully considered  the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 23 of

Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 and section 324 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved.       It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

2nd     respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant        has  no   further grievance  against the

Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                                    4

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly     and     pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire

Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                                   5

         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because      of the    compromise  between    the
         offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
         is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
         case would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According       to    me,  in    the  light   of   the   facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case.         According to me, as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of

the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decision

Crl.M.C.No.4283 of 2014
                               6

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A final report in Crime No.458 of 2013 of Vidya

Nagar Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner thereto.

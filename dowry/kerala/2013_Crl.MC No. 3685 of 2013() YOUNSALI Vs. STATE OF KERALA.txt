                          V.K. MOHANAN, J.
                  ......................................................
                        CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013
                  ......................................................
                Dated this the 30th day of August, 2013

                                O R D E R



      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

accused Nos.2 and 4 in C.C.No.244/13 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna, which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No.51/2013 of

Wandoor Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections 452,341 and 324 read with Section 34 of I.P.C with a

prayer to quash       all further             proceedings              against  the

petitioners pursuant to Annexure A1 charge sheet in Crime

No.51/13 of Wandoor police station pending as C.C.No.244/13

on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II,

Perinthalmmanna as the matter is settled out of court.

      2. The allegation in the above case is that on 27.1.13 at

about 6 p.m     due to        previous          animosity on             account of

difference of opinion in connection with a local football match,

the accused persons four in number, in furtherance of their

common intention to cause hurt to CW1, criminally trespassed

CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013          2

into the shop of CW1, wrongfully       restrained him, beat him

with hands, hit with stone and caused simple hurt. Thus      the

accused has     committed      the offences    punishable under

sections 452, 341 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC. Now the

case of the petitioners is that during the pendency of the above

case, the entire dispute is settled with the second respondent

out of court and accordingly the second respondent has

sworn into Annexure A2 affidavit.

     3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that,

during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in

the above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

     5.    The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the second

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the de

facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further against

the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013           3

     6.    I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.      I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A2 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Sections 452,341 and 324 read with Section 34

of IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached

this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the second respondent, it

appears to me that the the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013            4

                 "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus: the

         power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

         exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences

         under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of

         wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

         it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

         abuse of the process of any Court. In what

         cases power to quash the criminal proceeding

         or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their

         dispute would depend on the facts and

         circumstances of each case and no category

         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But  the   criminal  cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes    of   quashing,    particularly  the

          offences      arising     from     commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences arising

CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013          5

        out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

        family disputes where the wrong is basically

        private or personal in nature and the parties

        have resolved their entire dispute.      In this

        category of cases, High Court may quash

        criminal proceedings if in its view, because of

        the compromise between the offender and

        victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

        and bleak and continuation of criminal case

        would put accused to great oppression and

        prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal

        case despite full and complete settlement and

        compromise with the victim........"

        8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute.   It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

CRL.M.C.NO.3685 OF 2013         6

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.    Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - I and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 244/13 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna/Annexure AI in Crime

No.51/2013    of   Wandoor   Police  Station   and   all further

proceedings thereto.




                                   V.K. MOHANAN, JUDGE.

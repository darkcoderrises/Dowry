                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       Criminal M.C.No.130/2013
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                Dated this the 7th day of January, 2013

                                  O R D E R

        The petitioners are accused in C.C.No.240/2009 on the file of the

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasaragode. The offences alleged are under

Sections 323, 498A, 506(ii) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Annexure-I is the copy of the final report.

      2.      The first petitioner is the husband of the first respondent and

he married the first respondent on 06/01/2008. The allegation is one of

cruelty demanding some dowry.

      3.      It is submitted that Annexure-II agreement has been executed

between the parties with the intervention of mediators thereby settling all

the disputes. One child is born in the wedlock and the child is being

retained by the mother as per the settlement. A reading of Annexure-II

agreement will show that various clauses have been incorporated therein

providing the details of the settlement.      It includes payment of certain

amounts also. As per condition (a), both parties agree to withdraw all

cases pending in all the courts. It is also agreed to settle C.C.No.240/2009

on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasaragode.

      4.      Since the offence under Section 498A of the Code of Criminal

Procedure is non compoundable, learned counsel for the petitioners prays

that this Court in exercise of the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to

Crl.M.C No.130/2013
                                 -:2:-

quash the proceedings in the case itself in the light of the decision of the

Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

Evidently, the criminal complaint arose due to the matrimonial dispute

between the parties. This is only a private dispute and all the tests laid

down by the Apex Court in the above decisions are satisfied herein. As

already noticed in clause 2(a),     parties have agreed to withdraw the

criminal complaints.

       5.    Having regard to the various aspects noted above, I am

satisfied that the power under Section 482 the Code of Criminal Procedure

could be invoked herein. Accordingly, the criminal miscellaneous case is

allowed. Further proceedings in C.C.No.240/2009 on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate, Kasaragode will stand quashed.




                               (T.R. Ramachandran Nair, Judge.)

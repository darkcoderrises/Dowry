               ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No.2352 of 2013
               ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                              ORDER

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 & 2 in C.C.No.42 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kannur which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.106 of 2011 of Kannapuram Police Station, for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 &

149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further proceedings in

Annexure A2 Final Report in C.C.No.42 of 2013 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur as the

matter is settled out of court.

    2.       The    allegation      in     the    above  case is

that on 27/03/2011 at 00.30 when the third respondent was

going to see 'theyyam' and when he reached near Kallyaseri

amsom Erinavu U.P.School, the petitioners/the accused

Crl.M.C.No.2352/2013

                              :-2-:

persons unlawfully assembled together and attacked the third

respondent, and beaten him with hand and inflicted injuries

using stone. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter

is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the third respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the third respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance against

Crl.M.C.No.2352/2013

                              :-3-:

them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition which is

marked as Annexure A3 affidavit.        In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,

324 & 149 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

third respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

Crl.M.C.No.2352/2013

                                            :-4-:

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                    "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.     Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.2352/2013

                                            :-5-:

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

         dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

         transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

         etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

         this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

         its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

Crl.M.C.No.2352/2013

                              :-6-:

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings in Annexure A2 Final Report in C.C.No.42

of    2013      on  the file   of    the  Judicial  First  Class

Magistrate Court-I, Kannur.

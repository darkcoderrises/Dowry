                 B. A. No. 2875 of 2013
       =.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=.=
             Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013

                          O R D E R

     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 778/2013 of

Kottarakkra Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under sections 498A and 494 IPC. The allegation

against the petitioner is that he harassed and tortured the

de facto complainant who is his wife by demanding more

dowry. The further allegation is that during the subsistence

of the marriage, the petitioner has gone through a form of

marriage with another woman, in whom he has a child now.

      2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor and perused the case diary.

      3. The Investigating Officer reported that the fact, as

to whether the petitioner had entered into a subsequent

marriage, is yet to be ascertained. Learned counsel for the

petitioner points out that the de facto complainant and the

petitioner were residing separately for the last two years

BA 2875/2013                    2

and proceedings in petitions for divorce, for maintenance

and return of articles etc. are pending before the Family

Court, Kottarakkara instituted by the de facto complainant.

      4. It is a fact that there is a serious allegation of an

offence under section 494 IPC in this case, the veracity of

which is yet to be ascertained. The investigation of this case

is not over. If that be so, I am satisfied that while dismissing

the application seeking anticipatory bail, an opportunity can

be granted to the petitioner to surrender before the

Investigating    Officer    and    to   co-operate    with  the

investigation.

       5. In the result, this bail application is dismissed. At

the same time, if so advised, the petitioner may surrender

before the Investigating Officer within ten days from today.

In such case, the Investigation Officer after interrogation

and investigation, shall produce the petitioner before the

concerned Judicial First Class Magistrate, where the

petitioners can move for bail. The learned Magistrate shall

pass appropriate orders, at the earliest, preferably on the

BA 2875/2013                 3

same day itself, provided, it is moved after notice to the

learned Assistant Public Prosecutor.




                             B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE.

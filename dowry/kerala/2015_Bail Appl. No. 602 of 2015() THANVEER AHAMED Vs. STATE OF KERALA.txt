              Dated this the 2nd day of March, 2015

           Petition filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

      2.   Petitioner        is    the      1st    accused         in  Crime

No.511/2013 of Hosdurg Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 506(i) and

498A read with Section 34 IPC.

      3.   After making a false representation that the

petitioner was a Post Graduate in Orthopedics and had

obtained MS Degree in it, he had entered into a contract of

marriage with the de facto complainant woman by obtaining

an amount 20 lakhs and 300 sovereigns of gold

ornaments. Within a short period, the entire gold ornaments

BA.602/2015
                             : 2 :



were taken away by the petitioner and his mother and some

of those gold ornaments were disposed of and a good

quantity of the balance gold ornaments were pledged in

three banks for huge amounts. After misappropriating her

entire gold ornaments and money, she was tortured to the

maximum, by demanding more dowry.            He has never

obtained any degree in Orthopedics and he is not even a

medical graduate at all. In fact, on a false representation

that he had acquired MS Orthopedics Degree, he had

practised at a hospital as Orthopedist. The petitioner has

been in custody for the period from 09.01.2015 onwards.

     4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned

counsel for the de facto complainant and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     5.    The learned counsel for the de facto complainant

has pointed out that once the petitioner was enlarged on bail

and thereafter, he was absconding and subsequently, he

has surrendered on 09.01.2015. The learned counsel for

BA.602/2015
                                : 3 :



the petitioner submits that the petitioner has undertaken to

settle the matter within a short span of time on his

enlargement of bail and the pledged gold ornaments can be

obtained and released within a short span of time. Having

regard to the period undergone by the petitioner in custody,

the present stage of investigation and the possible chance

of settlement in the matter, I am satisfied that the petitioner

can be enlarged on bail on strict conditions.

     6.    In the result, this Bail Application is allowed and

the petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on his executing a

bond for `1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) with two

solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of

the concerned Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)  Both    the    sureties  shall  produce
      solvency certificates for 1,00,000/- each before
      the court below.

            (ii) The petitioner shall report before the
      Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
      on all Mondays and Thursdays commencing from

BA.602/2015
                                 : 4 :



     09.03.2015 for a period of six months.

           (iii) The petitioner shall not tamper with the
     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (iv)  The    petitioner    shall  make himself
     available for interrogation as and when required by
     the Investigating Officer.

           (v)   The petitioner shall not involve in any
     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

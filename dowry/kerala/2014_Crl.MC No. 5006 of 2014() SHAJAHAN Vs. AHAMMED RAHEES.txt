                       Crl.M.C.No. 5006 of 2014
                 .........................................................
             Dated this the 1st day of September, 2014.


                                    O R D E R



        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused in C.C. No. 1961                              of 2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate - I, Kasaragod                            which is a case

instituted  upon a police report in Crime                         No. 720 of 2012      of

Kasaragod Police Station for offences punishable under Sections

323 and 324 read with Sec. 34 IPC with a prayer to quash all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in the above

Case, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegations in the above case is that the petitioners

in furtherance of their common intention to attack the de facto

complainant, attacked him with dangerous weapon and thereby

sustained   injuries on him and, now the case of the petitioners is

Crl.M.C.No. 5006 of 2014

                                :-2-:

that the matter is settled out of Court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

the first   respondent/de facto complainant. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.       Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case        is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for first    respondent, who on the

basis of specific instructions received from the first  respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.      In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived      at between the parties to the dispute, the

Crl.M.C.No. 5006 of 2014

                                  :-3-:

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case

are only under Sections 323 and 324 read with Sec. 34 IPC which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.    It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me that the de

facto   complainant      has   no    further    grievance      against   the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

               "57.     The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
         Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
         in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
         offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

Crl.M.C.No. 5006 of 2014

                                      :-4-:

          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
          of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal
          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
          offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
          the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
          be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
          commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
          criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
          remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
          accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
          would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
          full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

          8.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case, and particularly,

in view of the settlement arrived at in the present case, the

dictum laid down in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

Crl.M.C.No. 5006 of 2014

                                   :-5-:

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court

to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.              It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court,

in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have

any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather than the net result would be a sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.        Thus, according to me, following the decision

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed,        all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C. No.1961 of

2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Kasaragod are quashed.              .

      Dated this the 1st day of September,2014.

                  Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                                ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.1116/2011 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Hosdurg which is a case

instituted upon the police report for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash all

proceedings in C.C.No1116/2011 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that the defacto

complainant had married by the first accused on 29/7/2204 in

accordance with the rites and customs prevailing among the

Islam religion and thereafter she was residing along with the

accused in her matrimonial home and while so the accused

stating that the dowry given was    insufficient ill treated her and

demanding more dowry she was subjected to harassed both

mentally and physically and thereby the accused committed the

offences punishable under Sections 498A of I.P.C. Now, the case

of the petitioners is that during the pendency of the above

Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
                                2

disputes an agreement was arrived between the parties and the

matter is settled amicable and now the spouses are mutually

agreed to separate. The second respondent, defacto complainant

has sworn into Annexure-A4 affidavit.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent.    I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case.     Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on the

basis of specific instruction received      from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
                                       3

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of

the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Sections 498A which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 2nd

respondent, it appears to me that the the de facto complainant

has no further grievance against the petitioners accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision

reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held

as follows:-

                "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes

         have been on considerable increase in recent times

         resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A

         and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also

Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
                                       4

         against the relatives of the husband. The question is

         when such matters are resolved either by the wife

         agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual

         settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed

         for quashing of the criminal proceedings or the FIR or

         complaint by the wife under Sections 498A and 406 of

         I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the sole

         ground that since the offences are non-compoundable

         under   Section    320 of    the Code,     it would be

         impermissible for the court to quash the criminal

         proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand

         subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under

         Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of

         the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-

         wishers, the parties concerned have amicably settled

         their      differences        and        executed         a

         compromise/settlement.         Pursuant    thereto,     the

         appellants filed the said compromise before the Trial

         Court with a request to place the same on record and

         to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the

         mutual    settlement    arrived   at   by   the   parties,

         respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating that

         she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings

         against the appellants and fully supported the contents

         of the settlement deed.      It is the grievance of the

         appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such

         prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe

         exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code

Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
                                       5

         only on the ground that the criminal proceedings relate

         to the offences punishable under Sections 498A and

         406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to

         encourage     genuine    settlements    of  matrimonial

         disputes,   particularly, when    the   same    are    on

         considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes

         and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled

         the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold

         that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of

         power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the subsequent

         criminal proceedings.

                   13.     There has been       an outburst     of

         matrimonial disputes in recent times. The institution of

         marriage occupies an important place and it has an

         important role to play in the society. Therefore, every

         effort should be made in the interest of the individuals

         in order to enable them to settle down in life and live

         peacefully.  If the parties ponder over their defaults

         and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual

         agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law,

         in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial

         matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to

         state that the power under Section 482 should be

         exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when

         the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on

         record, that allowing the proceedings to continue would

         be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the

         ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

Crl.M.C. No. 2817 of 2013
                                   6

         be quashed."

 In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section

498A of I.P.C.     The criminal proceedings for the said offence

originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case as

well.

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid

in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the present

case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out

of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would

not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C.

can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

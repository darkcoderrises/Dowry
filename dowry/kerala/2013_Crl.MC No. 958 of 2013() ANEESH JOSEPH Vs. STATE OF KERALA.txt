                   ----------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C.No. 958 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

           The petitioners are the accused in C.C.No.494 of 2011 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor, which is a case

instituted upon the report of the Police in Crime No.422 of 2011 of

the Ettumanoor Police Station.         The offences alleged against the

petitioners are under Sections 405,406,323,324,498A read with

Section 34 of I.P.C. The second respondent herein initially

approached the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor by

filing CMP No.1236 of 2011, which is a private complaint and the

same was sent to the Ettumanoor Police Station under Section 156(3)

of the Cr.P.C. on the basis of which, the above crime was registered

and on completing the investigation, they preferred a report.

Accordingly, C.C.No.494 of 2011 was instituted in the trial court.

The petitioners now preferred this Crl.M.C. under Section 482 of the

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                 :-2-:

Cr.P.C. on the ground that the matter is settled between the parties to

the dispute and therefore, seeks an order from this Court to quash all

proceedings in C.C.No.494 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the counsel

appearing for the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

      4. As the matter is settled out of court between the parties,

according to me, this Court need not go into the detailed facts of the

case. However, it can be seen that the entire criminal proceedings are

initiated at the instance of the second respondent connected with the

matrimonial dispute arose between the first petitioner and the daughter

of the second respondent, who is the wife of the first petitioner.

Counsel for the petitioners submitted that on the strength of Annexure

A4 judgment of a foreign court, the dispute between the first petitioner

and his wife, who is the daughter of the second respondent is settled

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                   :-3-:

forever and therefore, there is no meaning in proceeding with the trial

of the case pending before the trial court.          The learned counsel

appearing for the second respondent also admitted about the

settlement arrived into between the first petitioner and his former wife,

who is the daughter of the second respondent. The learned counsel for

the second respondent also invited my attention to Annexure A5

affidavit sworn in by the second respondent.

      5. I have gone through the above affidavit. In the said affidavit,

it is specifically stated that the first petitioner married the daughter of

the second respondent on 30.10.2009 and due to difference of opinion,

the marriage was irretrievably broken and as part of the said dispute,

he preferred a complaint before the court which resulted in

C.C.No.494 of 2011. In para 3 of the affidavit, it is specifically stated

that the dispute between the first petitioner and the daughter of the

second respondent has already been settled and on that basis, a

divorce decree has been passed by the superior court of State of

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                  :-4-:

California, County of Los Angeles. From the statement, it is further

clear that as per the settlement, parties are agreed to settle all disputes

between them and accordingly, a joint application was filed to

withdraw C.C.No.494 of 2011.

      5. Having regard to the above facts and circumstances and in the

light of the submission made by learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents, it can be seen that though non-compoundable

offences are involved, all such offences alleged are as a part of the

criminal proceedings initiated by the second respondent connected

with the matrimonial disputes between the first petitioner and the

daughter of the second respondent. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decisions of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108]                 and Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another

[2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)] which are squarely applicable in the present

case. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                              :-5-:

                       "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                           :-6-:

        this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

        its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

        case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

        injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

        despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


Further, in Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex Court has held

as follows:-


                 "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

        considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

        under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

        also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

        matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

        home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

        the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

        the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

        Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

        the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

        Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

        the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                            :-7-:

                 8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

        filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

        Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

        intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

        concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

        compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

        compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

        record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

        herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

        arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

        stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

        the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

        is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

        such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

        jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

        criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

        498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

        genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

        are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

        compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

        satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

        pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                           :-8-:

        320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

        of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent

        times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place and it has

        an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

        made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to settle

        down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults

        and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

        fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice in the

        matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising its

        extraordinary jurisdiction.    It is trite to state that the power under

        Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only

        when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

        allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

        the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

        be quashed."


According to me, considering the facts and circumstances involved in

the present case, the dictum laid down therein is attracted in the

present case and therefore, following the above decision, this Crl.M.C.

can be disposed of, particularly when, even if the parties are directed

to face the trial, there would not be any fruitful turnout and the net

CRL.M.C.NO. 958 of 2013

                                   :-9-:

result would be sheer waste of time of the court below.

             In the result, this Criminal M.C. is allowed quashing all

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.494 of 2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor.

             This Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.

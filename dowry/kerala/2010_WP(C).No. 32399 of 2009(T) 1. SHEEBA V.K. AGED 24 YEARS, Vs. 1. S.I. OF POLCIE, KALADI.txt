K.M. Joseph, J.


      Petitioner seeks adequate police protection to the life of

the petitioner and her family members from the threat of

respondents 2 and 3.           A direction is also sought to take

appropriate steps on Ext.P3 complaint.

      2. Briefly put, the case of the petitioner is as follows:

      Petitioner married the second respondent.                   There was

demand for dowry at the time of marriage. It is stated that

respondents 2 and 3 and other family members were not

satisfied. A case is said to be registered under Sections 498(A)

and 34 of the IPC. It is stated that there is threat. This Court

had ordered mediation. Mediation has failed.

      3. We heard the learned counsel for the parties. Learned

counsel for respondents 2 and 3 submits that there is no

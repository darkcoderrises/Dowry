                       B.A.No.1578 of 2015(B)
                   ...............................................
                Dated this the 27        th day of May, 2015

                                  O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2. First petitioner is the son of the second petitioner. They

have allegedly committed the offences under sections 498A read

with 34 of IPC and section 3 & 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,

1961. The prosecution case is that they subjected the wife of the

first petitioner to cruelty and demanded dowry from her parents.

      3. Heard.

      4. The first petitioner and the first informant have been

married for less than two years. There is no case that the first

informant sustained any serious injuries.                   The possibility of a

reunion cannot be ruled out.                  So, I am inclined to grant

anticipatory bail.

      In the result, this application is allowed.

      1) The petitioners shall be released on bail after

interrogation on their executing a bond for Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees

twenty five thousand only) each with two solvent sureties each for

like sum if they are arrested by the Police in connection with this

case.

B.A.No.1578 of 2015(B)          ::2::




      2) They shall appear before the Investigating Officer for

interrogation if they are so required by him in writing.

      3) They shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

      4)They shall not harass the defacto complainant or her

relatives.

      In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the

learned Magistrate is empowered to cancel the bail in accordance

with the law.

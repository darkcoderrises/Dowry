               Crl. M.C. No. 4412 of 2014
           ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 14th day of August, 2014

                           ORDER



           The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is accused in Crime No.

578/2014 of Mattannur Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 354 and 506 (1) I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash Annexure-I FIR and all further proceedings

in Crime No. 578/2014 of Mattannur Police, as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that on

20.3.2013, when the 1st respondent who was a servant in

the house of the petitioner was doing her work in the

kitchen, the petitioner caught hold of her from behind and

attempted outrage her modesty and when the 1st respondent

resisted, the petitioner threatened to kill her and now, the

Crl. M.C. No. 4412 of 2014         2



case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of

court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent, submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.       In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

Crl. M.C. No. 4412 of 2014              3



dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection

in allowing the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 354 and

506(1) IPC, which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for

the first respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant        has   no     further     grievance      against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
          above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
          the   power    given   to  a   criminal   court   for
          compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

Crl. M.C. No. 4412 of 2014               4



          statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
          accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
          viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
          prevent abuse of the process of any Court.        In
          what      cases   power    to  quash    the criminal
          proceeding     or  complaint    or   F.I.R. may   be
          exercised where the offender and victim have
          settled their dispute would depend on the facts
          and circumstances of each case and no category
          can be prescribed..

              It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But   the     criminal   cases  having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial,         financial,mercandile,     civil,
           partnership or such like transactions or the
           offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
           wrong is basically private or personal in nature
           and the parties have resolved their entire dispute.
           In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
           compromise between the offender and victim, the
           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
           continuation of criminal case would put accused
           to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
           injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
           the criminal case despite        full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim........"

          8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present

case.     Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

Crl. M.C. No. 4412 of 2014       5



compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.          It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court,

in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not

have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - I FIR and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioner in Crime No. 578/2014 of Mattannur Police

Station.

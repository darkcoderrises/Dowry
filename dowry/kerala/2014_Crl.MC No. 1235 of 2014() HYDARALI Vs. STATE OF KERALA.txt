    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014
    ==============================
      Dated this, the 26th day of February, 2014.




                           O R D E R



     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the

original 7th accused in Crime No.231/04 of Thrithala Police

Station and is the sole accused in C.C.No.424/10 which is

pending as L.P.No.22/12 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pattambi, to quash the proceedings after

recording composition with the de facto complainant under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioner was

arrayed as 7th accused in Crime No.231/04 of Thrithala Police

Station alleging offences under Sections. 143, 147, 148, 341,

323, 324, 427 & 188 of Indian Penal Code along with 9 other

accused persons. After investigation, final report was filed and

it was originally taken on file as C.C.No.76/05. Accused Nos.1,

4, 6, 8 to 10 faced trial in that case and after trial, they were

acquitted by the court alleging that the prosecution has failed

to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The case against

accused Nos.2,3,5 & 7 in the original final report was split up

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014        :   2 :

and refiled as C.C.No.299/09 arraying accused Nos.2, 3, 5 & 7

in the original final report as accused Nos.1 to 4 and in that

case also, the present petitioner did not appear. So, case

against the other accused persons namely accused Nos.2, 3 &

5 were, after trial, were acquitted by the court as per

judgment dated 24.06.2010. Thereafter, the case against the

present petitioner was split up and refiled as C.C.No.424/10

and since he did not appear, the case was transferred to

register of long pending cases as L.P.No.22/12.                 Now, the

matter has been settled between the de facto complainant and

the other injured persons who were shown as respondents 2 to

4 and no purpose will be served by proceeding with the case.

Since, some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature,

the same cannot be compounded before the trial court. So, he

has no other option except to approach this court seeking the

following relief:

           "To quash Annexure 1 Final Report and all further

    proceedings in L.P.No.22/2012 now pending on the file of the

    Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pattambi in the interest of

    justice."



      3.     Respondents 2 to 4 appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014    :  3 :

parties and they have no intention to proceed against the

present petitioner as the case against other accused persons

were ended in acquittal and no purpose will be served in

proceeding with the case.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioner and he has no other

criminal antecedent.

      5.     Counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of

the settlement arrived between the parties, no purpose will be

served by retaining the case on file.

      6.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the de facto complainant, Crime No.

231/04 was registered by Sub Inspector of Police, Thrithala

Police Station against the petitioner and 9 others alleging

offences under Sections.143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 427,

188 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, final report was filed in the case was originally

taken on file as C.C.No.76/05. Original accused Nos. 1, 4, 6, 8

to 10 appeared and faced trial and after trial, they were

acquitted by the court. Case against original accused Nos. 2, 3

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014     :  4 :

5 & 7 (including the petitioner) was split up and refiled as

C.C.No.299/09 and in that case also the present petitioner did

not appear, others were tried and were acquitted by judgment

dated 24.06.2010.       The case against the present petitioner

was split up and refiled as C.C.No.424/10 and since he did not

appear and was absconding, the case was transferred to

register of long pending cases as L.P.No.22/12. Except the

present petitioner, the case against other accused persons

were ended in acquittal after trial. Now, the matter has been

settled between the de facto complainant and other injured

who were shown as respondents 2 to 4.

      7.     Further, in the decision reported in Moosa Vs. Sub

Inspector of Police [2006 (1) KLT 552], full bench of this

court has held that acquittal of some of the accused persons

after trial will not entitle the co-accused seeking for an

acquittal invoking inherent powers. But in the same decision,

it has been held that if the root of the prosecution case itself

has been shattered on the basis of evidence and the entire

prosecution case itself was not believed by the court, then, the

case against the other accused who did not face trial can be

quashed on the basis of acquittal of other co-accused by this

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014         :   5 :

court invoking Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      8.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] is held as follows:

              "The position that emerges from the above discussion
       can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
       quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
       exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
       from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
       offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
       plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
       in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
       secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
       process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
       criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
       where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
       depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
       category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
       power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
       gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
       depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
       be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
       and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
       not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
       Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
       relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
       of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
       while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
       for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
       the   criminal   cases    having   overwhelmingly     and   pre-
       dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
       purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
       commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,   partnership or such
       like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
       relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong
       is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
       resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
       Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of
       the compromise between the offender and victim, the
       possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
       of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
       prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
       quashing    the  criminal   case   despite  full  and   complete
       settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
       the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
       contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014         :  6 :

       proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
       tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
       compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
       to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
       case is put to end and if the answer to the above question(s) is
       in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
       jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      9.         So, in view of the dictum laid down in Gian

Singh's Case and also considering the fact that the case

against other accused persons were ended in acquittal after

trial on the ground that the prosecution was not able to prove

the incident as such as claimed by the injured witnesses and

now all the injured witnesses including the de facto

complainant have settled their dispute with the present

petitioner and now they are living in harmony and no purpose

will be served by allowing the trial to proceed with as against

the present petitioner in view of the fact that all the injured

persons have settled their dispute with the present petitioner

and they will not support the case of the prosecution and there

is remote possibility of conviction being entered against the

present petitioner and allowing the trial to go will only be a

wastage of judicial time, this court feels that this is a fit case

where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure can be invoke to quash the proceedings against the

Crl.M.C.No. 1235 of 2014    : 7 :

petitioner as well.

      So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

L.P.No.22/12 (C.C.No.424/10 in Crime No.231/04 of Thrithala

Police Station) pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pattambi, as against the petitioner is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court for necessary action in this regard.

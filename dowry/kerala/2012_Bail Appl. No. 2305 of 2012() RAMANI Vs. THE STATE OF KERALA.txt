            Dated this the 17th day of April, 2012

                              ORDER

      Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.106 of 2012 of

North Paravur Police Station, accused of offence punishable under

Section 498 r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Petitioners 1

and 2 are the parents in law of the de-facto complainant. Third

petitioner is his sister in law and fourth petitioner the husband of

third petitioner.     Allegation is that demanding more dowry

petitioners inflicted physical and mental cruelty on the de-facto

complainant.     Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that

allegations are false. I have heard learned Public Prosecutor as

well.

      2. Having regard to the facts and circumstances alleged in

annexure A private complaint, I am inclined to grant anticipatory

bail.

      Hence this application is allowed. Petitioners are granted

anticipatory bail.    In the event of their arrest, they shall be

B.A. No. 2305 of 2012             -2-


released on their executing bond for Rs.15,000/-(Rupees fifteen

thousand) each with two sureties each for the like sum to the

satisfaction of Judicial First Class Magistrate, North Paravur and

subject to following conditions:

      i) Petitioners shall report before the Investigating Officer as

and when required by him for interrogation.

      ii) The sureties shall produce photocopy of their title deed

and identity card attested by petitioners' counsel along with the

recent receipt for payment of land revenue.

      iii) Petitioners shall surrender their Passport if any before

the learned Magistrate before they are released on bail and in

case they have none, file affidavit to that effect before the

learned Magistrate before they are released on bail.

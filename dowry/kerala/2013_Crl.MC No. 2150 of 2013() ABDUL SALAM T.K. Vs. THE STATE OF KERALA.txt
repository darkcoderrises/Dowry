            ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 12th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482

of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is an accused in Crime No.

472/2009 of Chandera Police Station for the offences

punishable under Section 436 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash

Annexure A2 final report and all further proceedings pursuant

to it in Crime No.472/2009 of Chandera police station, which is

now pending as S.C.No.923/2012 on the file of the Additional

District and Sessions Judge (Adhoc-III) Kasaragod as against

the petitioner, so as to secure the ends of justice as the matter

is settled out of court.

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that the

allegations leveled against the accused in the above crime is

that in between 10.30 p.m of 3/12/2009 and 9 a.m of

14/12/2009 some unknown persons have set fire to the local

committee office of the CPIM at Padna and in the above

incident the table, chair and electrical wirings were destroyed

thereby causing a loss of about Rs.25,000/- thereby the

accused committed the above offences. Now, the case of the

Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
                                 2

petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received          from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
                                   3

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Section 436 of I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case,

the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from

          the above discussion can be summarised

          thus:      the power of the High Court in

          quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
                                  4

          power      given  to  a  criminal  court  for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of

          the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

          has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases      power    to quash   the   criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes      of  quashing, particularly the

          offences       arising  from     commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
                                   5

          such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its   view,    because   of  the  compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

          8.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that, as the parties to the dispute

Crl.M.C.No. 2150 of 2013
                                6

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -2 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioner in Crime No. 472/2009 of Chandera Police Station

and all further proceedings thereto.

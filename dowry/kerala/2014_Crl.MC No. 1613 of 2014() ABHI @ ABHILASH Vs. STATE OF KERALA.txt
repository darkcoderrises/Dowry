                     Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014
                  ..................................................
               Dated this the 5th day of June, 2014.

                               O R D E R




     This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by the accused

persons in Crime No.667/2012 of Kannur police                         station to

quash the entire proceedings pending against them in view of

the settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.


     2. Originally only those persons who have been arrayed as

accused in S.C.No.151/2013 on the file of the Assistant Sessions

Court, Kannur alone have filed the application for quashing

that case. When it was brought out that one more accused

involved in the case and since he was a juvenile, case against

him was split up and final report in respect of him was filed

before the   Juvenile      Justice Board (Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Thalassery), the petitioners have amended the petition

incorporating him as additional petitioner and filed additional

affidavit and also wanted to quash the proceedings against him

also. It is alleged in the petition that the above crime was

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014          2

registered on the basis of the statement given by the second

respondent as de facto complainant against the petitioners in

the amended petiton alleging offences under Sections 143,

147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 427, 308 read with Sectin 149 of the

Indian Penal Code and during the course of investigation, it was

revealed that the 6th petitioner, who was also arrayed as

accused was a juvenile and so after investigaton, Annexure A1

final report in respect of petitioners 1 to 5 was filed before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kannur, which was later

commited to the Sessions Court and it was taken on file as

SC.No.151/2013 and         made over to the   Assistant  Sessions

Court, Kannur where it is now pending. As against the 6th

petitioner is       concerned, final report was filed before the

Juvenile      Justice    Board (Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Thalassery) and it was taken on file as C.C.No.56/2013 and it is

pending before that court. Petitioners and defacto complainant

and respondents 3 to 5 are the injured in the incident and

the incident itself was happened on account of some act of the

de facto complainant washing the car from the road in front

of the house of the accused persons.

      3. Now the mattter has been settled between the parties.

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014                3

Respondents 2 to 5 have filed affidavit stating that they have

no grievance against the petitioners and their original

relationship has been restored.             Further Section 308 of the

Indian Penal Code is not attracted in this case. In view of the

settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case as well and conviction in such cases is not possible. Since

some of the offences alleged are non compoundable in nature,

they cannot file application for          compounding before the court

below. So they have no other remedy excpet to approch this

Court seeking the following relief:

                 For these and other grounds to be urged at the

         time of      hearing, it is  humbly prayed        that this

         Honourable Court be pleased to quash Annnexure-A1

         charge sheet in S.C.No.151/2013 on the file of the

         Assistant Sessions Court, Kannur and also the further

         proceedings    in   C.C.No.56/2013 pending before      the


         Juvenile Justice Court, in the interest of justice.

      4. Respondents 2 to 5 appeared through counsel and

submitted that since they are neighbours, they have settled

the matter due to intervention of mediators and their

relationship has been restored and they do not want to

prosecute the petitioners. They have also filed an affidavit

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014           4

stating these facts and they have no objection in quashing the

proceedings.

      5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

in view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,       as

directed by this Court submitted that except this case there is

no other case against the petitioners and since grave offences

have been incorporated, it cannot be quashed at this stage

invoking      Section 482 of the Code.

      7. It is an admitted fact that the incident happended on

1.4.2012 at about 2.15        a.m. The Kannur town police    had

registered a case against the petitioners along with ten other

identifiable persons as Crime No.667/2012 alleging offences

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 427 and 308 read

with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. It is also an admitted

fact that during investigation,      it was revealed that only 6

persons were involved in the incident and the 6th petitioner

herein was a juvenile and so case against him was split up

and final report in respect of him was filed before the Juvenile

Justice Board where it was taken on file as C.C.No.56/2013 and

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014          5

that is pending before that court. It is also an admitted fact

that as regards petitioners 1 to 5, final report was filed and after

commital, it is now pending before the Assistant Sessions Court,

Kannur as S.C.No.151/2013. It is also seen from the averments

in the petition and the affidavits filed by the injured including

the de facto complainant that the petitioners and the injured are

neighbours and the case has been registered on the basis of

some misunderstanding and due to the intervention of

mediators and well wishers of both parties the case has been

settled and their relationship has been restored. So, now the

de facto complainant as well as the injured do not want to

prosecute the petitioners. It is true that     Section 308 of the

Indian Penal Code has been incorporated which is a grave

offence. But I am not at this stage going into the question as to

whether the allegations are sufficient to attract the offence

under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code or not considering

the fact that the matter has been settled between the parties

due to intervention of well wishers of both the parties and it is

a property dispute that resulted in the crime and it is not having

any public interest as well. In view of the fact that the matter

has been settled, there is no possibility of conviction also, even

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014                 6

if the case is allowed to prosecute as none of the witnesses

including the de facto complainant will support the case of the

prosecution and continuing              the case will only amount to

wastage of judicial time.




      8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:



           "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

           arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

           partnership or such like transactions or the offences

           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

           may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

           of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

           continuation of criminal case would put accused to

           great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014                   7

           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

           case    despite   full and   complete    settlement  and

           compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

           Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

           contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

           criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

           proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

           law despite settlement and compromise between the

           victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

           of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

           an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

           affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

           jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the                      petitioners and

respondents 2 to 5 are neighbours and registration of the

crime has happened due to some misunderstanding between

them and the entire dispute between them has been settled due

to intervention of mediators and their original relationship has

been restored and convicion in such cases is remote, this Court

feels that it is a fit case where power under Section 482 of the

Crl.M.C.No.1613 of 2014             8

Code can be invoked to quash the proceedings in order to

promote the settlement and also restoration of           relationship

between the neighbours and the pendency of this case should

not a hurdle for the same.

        So, the petition is allowed and        further proceedings in

S.C.No.151/2013 pending before the Assistant Sessions Court,

Kannur as against the petitioners 1 to 5 herein, who are the

accused in this case and further proceedings in C.C.No.56/2013

against the 6th petitioner pending before the Juvenile Justice

Board (Chief judicial Magistrate Court, Thalassery) are hereby

quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned courts immediately for necessary further action.

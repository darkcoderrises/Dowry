       Application for anticipatory bail.

       2. The alleged offence is under section 498A IPC. According

to prosecution, petitioner allegedly harassed defacto-complainant

who is his wife, demanding dowry, etc.               Petitioner did not allow

her to share the bed and she was constrained to sleep in another

room.   In the week of March, 2008, defacto-complainant went

back to her house and since then they are living separately.

         3.Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

defacto-complainant had a physical inability to consummate the

marriage and hence she did not permit to have any physical

relationship with petitioner. Doctors diagnosed the rigidity in sex

and she was treated also for the complaint. After the marriage on

21-1-2007, till 18-3-2008 she was residing with the petitioner. She

left the petitioner's house on 18-3-2008 and did not resume the

cohabitation thereafter and hence on 14-7-2008 a lawyer's notice

was sent to her. Thereafter on 2nd August, 2008 this complaint

was filed making false allegations, it is submitted. Various medical

records are produced as Annexure-II series, which would show

BA5271 /08                         -2-

that she was examined by doctor and            she was treated for

inability to cohabit. Medical records issued on different dates from

28-2-2008 onwards are produced.

        4. On hearing both sides, I am satisfied that anticipatory

bail can be granted to petitioner and hence the following order is

passed:-

             Petitioner    shall   surrender     before     the

             Investigating Officer within seven days from the

             date of this order and, in the event of his arrest,

             if any, he shall be     released on bail on his

             executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- with two

             solvent sureties each for the like amount to the

             satisfaction of the arresting officer on condition

             that he will co-operate with the investigation

             and make himself available for interrogation by

             the Investigating Officer as and when directed.

        The application is allowed as above.



                                             K. HEMA, JUDGE.

                  CRL. M.C. No.1381 of 2015
           ...............................................................
             Dated this the 17th day of March, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 and A2 in Crime No.751/10 of the

Bekal Police Station, registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting all further proceedings in

C.C.No.1681/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-II, Hosdurg, which has arisen from Crime No.751/10

of the Bekal Police Station, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

CRL.M.C.No.1381 of 2015
                              -: 2 :-



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,  who     is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.1381 of 2015
                              -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in C.C.No.1681/2014 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg, which has arisen from Crime

No.751/10 of the Bekal Police Station, are hereby quashed.

     This is a petition for anticipatory bail.

     2. The alleged offences are under sections 406, 420,

498(A) r/w 34 of IPC. Petitioner is the 5th accused in the

crime. First accused and defacto complainant are husband

and wife. Defacto complainant filed a complaint alleging

various offences against husband and his family members

that they were harassing her demanding more dowry.

     3. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that

petitioner's marriage is fixed on 29.5.2010 and he has not

commit any offence. There is only bare allegation against

him in the complaint that other accused also harassed her.

Petitioner is the brother in-law of defacto complainant.

     On hearing both sides, I am satisfied that anticipatory

bail may be granted to the petitioner. Hence the following

                         B.A.No.4719 of 2013
                     -----------------------------------
        Dated this the 18th day of July, 2013


                                ORDER

      Petitioner is the first accused in crime No. 383/2013 of

Kasaragod Police Station registered for the offence punishable under

Section 498 A read with 34 IPC. He seeks pre-arrest bail under

section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, 'the Code').

      2. Crime was registered on a complaint filed by the wife of

petitioner before police alleging cruelty, both physical and mental,

and harassment by her husband, his parents and three of his close

relatives, demanding dowry. From the submissions made by the

counsel for petitioner and also the learned Public Prosecutor, it is

seen, some among the accused have been granted anticipatory bail

by the Sessions Judge.       Petitioner husband was in Gulf country

where he is employed when the others moved the application for

anticipatory bail, and the present application is filed by him after his

return to the country, is the submission. Learned Public Prosecutor

has made available the case diary for my perusal. Going through

the case diary, particularly the statement recorded from defacto

complainant giving rise to registration of crime I find the spouses

have been living separately for sometime.              Whatever be the

circumstances under which the wife left the matrimonial home,

having regard to the fact that the crime has arisen out of

matrimonial dispute of spouses, I find arrest and custodial

B.A.No.4719 of 2013                  2



interrogation of petitioner as such may not be required for a fair

investigation of the crime. Petitioner can be exteded pre-arrest bail

with direction to direct to co-operate with the investigation of crime.

       3. Petitioner shall report before the investigating officer at

10 am on 23.07.2013 and on such appearance after his

interrogation in the event of his arrest in the crime he is directed to

be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees

Ten Thousand only) with one solvent surety for the like sum.

Petitioner shall not leave the country without getting prior

permission from the magistrate before whom the FIR of the crime

has been produced. In case permission is applied for, that is shown

to be allowable, magistrate has to impose adequate conditions

including furnishing of cash security, as deemed fit and proper, to

secure his presence for the purpose of investigation/ trial, if need

be.

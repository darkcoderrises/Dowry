                 Bail Appln.No.5813 of 2011
             ----------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 22nd day of July, 2011

                               ORDER


      This is an application for bail under Section 439 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.           The petitioners are accused

Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.358 of 2011 of Alathur Police

Station.

      2.   The offence alleged against the petitioners is under

Section 304-B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.   The wife of the first accused consumed the leaves

of a poisonous plant on 23/06/2011 for the purpose of

committing suicide and she died on 24/06/2011. It is alleged

that she consumed the leaves of a poisonous plant on account

of the cruelty meted out to her demanding dowry.              It is

submitted that the second accused was arrested on

12/07/2011 and the first accused surrendered before court on

13/07/2011. Both of them are in judicial custody.

      4.   Taking into account the fact that the second

petitioner/second accused is a woman and also taking note of

her age, I am inclined to grant bail to her. However, in the

Bail Appln.No.5813/2011
                                    : 2 :


nature of the offence alleged and the facts and circumstances,

I am not inclined to grant bail to the first accused at this

stage.

      5.     The second petitioner/second accused shall be

released on bail on her executing bond for `25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the

like amount to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate of the

First Class, Alathur, subject to the following conditions:

      A)     The    second    petitioner/second   accused shall

             report before the investigating officer between 9

             A.M. and 11 A.M. on all Mondays, till the final

             report is filed or until further orders;

      B)     The    second    petitioner/second   accused shall

             appear    before the investigating officer for

             interrogation as and when required;

      C)     The second petitioner/second accused shall not

             try to influence the prosecution witnesses or

             tamper with the evidence.

      D)     The second petitioner/second accused shall not

             commit any offence or indulge in any prejudicial

             activity while on bail.

Bail Appln.No.5813/2011
                               : 3 :


      E)     In case of breach of any of the conditions

             mentioned above, the bail shall be liable to be

             cancelled.

      The Bail Application is allowed as above in so far as it

relates to the second petitioner/second accused.         The Bail

Application, in so far as it relates to the first petitioner/first

accused, is dismissed.

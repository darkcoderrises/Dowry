                 ----------------------------------------
                    Crl.M.C.No. 2619 of 2013
                 ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 27th day of June, 2013

                              O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the second accused in Crime No.959 of 2001

of the Nadapuram Police Station where the offences alleged are

under Sections 143, 147,148.447,427 read with Section 149 of

I.P.C. and Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act.

         2. According to the petitioner, altogether there are five

accused. Out of five, accused Nos.1 and 3 faced prosecution in

S.C.No.599/2005 and S.C.No.715 of 2005 and they were acquitted

by a common judgment dated 24.7.2008 of the court of Sessions,

Kozhikode Division in the above Sessions Cases. According to

the petitioner, who is the second accused, in the above

circumstances, even though he is prepared to face the trial, there

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                                :-2-:

will not be any fruitful turn out. It is also the further case of the

petitioner that the the dispute between himself and the de facto

complainant is settled.     Therefore, he preferred the above

Crl.M.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I final report and all

further proceedings pending against him in L.P.No.7 of 2013.

         3. The prosecution allegation is that on 16.12.2001 at

about 16.00 hours, the accused persons 1 to 5, unlawfully

assembled and in furtherance of their common intention,

trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant/first

respondent hurled stones and bomb towards the house and there

was loss of `500/- to the house and thereby committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,148.447,427 read

with Section 149 of I.P.C. and Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive

Substances Act.       Now, the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court between the de facto complainant

and himself.

         4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                               :-3-:

as the first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

in view of Annexure II judgment, the prosecution has failed to

prove its allegation against the accused and therefore, the

petitioner is entitled to get the same treatment. It is also

submitted that during the pendency of the above crime, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the dispute

which is the subject matter of the above crime. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

         6. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

         7. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                               :-4-:

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.          I have

perused Annexure-II judgment and in paragraph 13, the learned

Judge, who undertook the trial, has found that the charge

witnesses who are examined as Pws.1 and 2 have not spoken a

single word against the accused persons and Cws.3 and 4 were

not examined and it is concluded that there is not an iota of

evidence against the accused and accordingly, even the

questioning under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. , is dispensed with. If

that be so, according to me, sending of the petitioner to face the

trial will amount to sheer abuse of process of the court and the

same will be against the interest of justice. In the given facts

and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         8.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                                       :-5-:

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in

the above case are only Sections 143, 147,148.447,427 read

with Section 149 of I.P.C. and Sections 3 and 5 of the Explosive

Substances Act, which are more or less personal in nature and

no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the first

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the light of

the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High

         Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                                          :-6-:

          and different from the power given to a criminal court for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

          Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends

          of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.

          In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or

          complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and

          victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can be

          prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

          pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

          the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising

          from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is

          basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

          resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of

          the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility

          of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                                          :-7-:

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

         criminal case despite     full and complete settlement and

         compromise with the victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

Crl.M.C.No.2619 of 2013

                              :-8-:

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - I final report against the petitioner and all further

proceedings in L.P.No.7 of 2013 pending before the Assistant

Sessions Court, Vatakara.

         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                Dated this the 19th day of February 2015

                                      ORDER


      Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.     Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.3451/2014 of

Kayamkulam Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 498A, 323, 506, 406 and 294(b) read with Section

34 of the I.P.C.

      3.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

tortured and harassed the de-facto complainant, who is the wife of

the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. It is also alleged that

B.A.676/2015                      2

they had treated her with cruelty, by demanding more dowry after

misappropriating all her gold ornaments and money and that she

was severally being beaten up.

      4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    This is a case which involves a matrimonial offence.

The investigation of this case is practically over. The crime has

been registered on the basis of a private complaint filed by the de-

facto complainant, before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court, Kayamkulam, which was referred to the police for an

investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Considering the possible re-union of the parties in the

matter, I do not think that the custodial interrogation of the

petitioners is required for the continued investigation of this case.

Matters being so, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

B.A.676/2015                        3

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is conducting

the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge the petitioners on

bail in the event of their arrest on each of them executing a bond

for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two

solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the

officer conducting arrest, and subject to the following terms and

conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on

      all   alternative    Thursdays     commencing          from

      26.02.2015 for a period of three months or till the filing

      of the final report in this case, whichever is earlier.

            (ii) The petitioners shall not tamper with the

      evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

      available for interrogation as and when required by the

      investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

B.A.676/2015                       4

      offence while on bail.



      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

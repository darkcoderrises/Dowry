                   -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 3rd day of June, 2013


                              ORDER


      Petitioner is the 1st accused in crime No.170/2013 of

Vandiperiyar Police Station, registered for offences punishable

under Section 498(A) of the Indian Penal Code.             The 2nd

accused in the crime is his mother. The above crime was

registered on a complaint filed by his wife imputing

matrimonial cruelty, demanding dowry. Petitioner's wife filed

the complaint before the magistrate and that being referred to

Police for investigation and report, the crime was registered.

Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail submitting that he has not

committed any offence.

      2.    From the submissions made it is seen that in the

wedlock the spouses have two children. Having regard to the

fact that the crime has arisen out of matrimonial disputes

between spouses, I find, arrest and custodial interrogation of

petitioner may not be essential for its fair investigation.

      3.  In the event of arrest of petitioner by Police in

 B.A.No. 3860 of 2013            2




connection with the above crime petitioner is directed to be

released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.10,000/-with

one solvent surety.       He has to co-operate with the

investigation of the crime.

                    Crl. M.C. No. 2261 of 2014
             =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
              Dated this, the 22nd day of April, 2014.

                             O R D E R

     The Crl. M.C. is filed to quash final report in C.C. No.

193/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Chavakkad,

arising from Crime No. 1335/2012 of Guruvayur Police Station.

The offence alleged is under Section 498(A) read with Section 34

I.P.C. The facts involved in the case would disclose that the 2nd

respondent has alleged that certain gold ornaments entrusted

by her parents were utilised by the 1st petitioner. Thereafter, the

1st petitioner treated her cruelly demanding more dowry, which

resulted in the complaint and final report as Annexure A.

     2.     It is submitted that the matter had been settled

between the parties and Annexure B affidavit of the 2nd

respondent evidences the same.

     3.     Having regard to the fact that this is a case which

involves civil dispute as well, there is no point in proceeding with

the prosecution of the case as the parties had settled the matter

amicably.

     In the light of the above said submission, I am of the view

that Annexure A final report in C.C.No. 193/2013 of JFMC,

Chavakkad      can be quashed.        Accordingly,     the same is

quashed.


                                  Sd/- A.M. Shaffique, Judge.

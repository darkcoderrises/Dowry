                        B.A.No.4604 of 2013
                    -----------------------------------
                Dated this the 3rd day of July, 2013


                               ORDER


     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.316 of 2013 of

Arthunkal Police Station registered for offences punishable

under Sections 417, 420, 495, 498(A), 406, 409 and 323

r/w. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. After having

unsuccessfully moved an application for pre-arrest bail before

the Sessions Judge which was turned down vide Annexure A1

order, he has filed the above application seeking such relief from

this court.

     2. The above crime was registered on a complaint filed by

the wife of petitioner before the magistrate imputing matrimonial

cruelty by petitioner and his mother demanding dowry. She was

subjected to inhuman cruelty by both of them, is her case, with

other allegations also constituting the other offences registered

in the crime, for their prosecution. 2nd accused in the crime, it is

submitted by learned counsel for petitioner, committed suicide

on 01.06.2013. Petitioner is falsely implicated in the crime on

B.A.No.4604 of 2013
                               2

baseless allegations and several other proceedings are

pending between the spouses before the family court, is the

submission of counsel.     Opposing the application learned

Public Prosecutor submitted that materials gathered by the

investigating agency disclose complicity of petitioner in the

grave offences imputed and this is not a fit case where

petitioner can be extended the discretionary relief of

anticipatory bail.

      3. Case diary has been produced for my perusal. After

going through the complaint of the wife and also materials so

far gathered by investigating agency, I find considerable force

in the submissions made by learned Public Prosecutor that

petitioner is not entitled to anticipatory bail.     Whatever

defences available to petitioner can be canvassed by him

before the investigating officer after surrender and, then,

co-operating with the investigation.

      In case petitioner surrender before the investigating

officer at 10.00.a.m.on 08.07.2013, after his interrogation and

in the event of their arrest, he shall be produced before the

magistrate of competent jurisdiction without delay. On such

production application for bail, if any, moved by petitioner

with advance notice to Assistant Public Prosecutor shall be

B.A.No.4604 of 2013
                               3

considered expeditiously, and disposed by the magistrate, on

its merits in accordance with law.

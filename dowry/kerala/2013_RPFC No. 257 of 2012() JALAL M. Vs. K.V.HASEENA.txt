                    R.P.(F.C.) No. 257 OF 2012
                  -----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 12th day of March, 2013


                               O R D E R

      The Revision Petitioner is the respondent in M.C.83/2011 on

the file of the Family Court, Thalassery.             The impugned order

under challenge was passed on an application filed by the

respondents herein under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure claiming maintenance allowance from the Revision

Petitioner. The respondents claimed Rs.3,000/- each per month

towards their maintenance.         But the learned Judge passed an

order directing the Revision Petitioner to pay Rs.1,500/- each per

month towards maintenance of the respondents. This order is

under challenge in this Revision Petition.

      2. According to the 1st respondent, the Revision Petitioner

is the legally wedded husband of the 1st respondent and 2nd

respondent is the daughter aged 2 = years born in that wedlock.

At the time of marriage, the 1st respondent has been given 22

sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs.1,50,000/- as dowry. The

Revision Petitioner had taken away entire gold ornaments and he

demanded more gold ornaments.                   Thereafter the Revision

Petitioner had gone abroad. First respondent found difficult to

R.P.(F.C.) No. 257 OF 2012          2

stay with her in-laws because of their cruelty. Therefore, she had

left her matrimonial home and thereafter she delivered the 2nd

respondent and informed the Revision Petitioner, who is working

abroad. But he neither contacted the 1st respondent nor sent a

single pai towards their maintenance. Subsequently, the Revision

Petitioner had returned from Gulf.       But he had neglected the

respondents.          He had not even paid any amount towards the

maintenance of the respondents after marriage. The Revision

Petitioner earns Rs.20,000/- per month and he is having

immovable properties. Per contra, the 1st respondent has no job

or income and she is depending on her relatives. In that context,

she was compelled to claim Rs.3,000/- each per month towards

maintenance.

        3. The Revision Petitioner entered appearance and filed a

counter statement admitting their marriage and paternity of the

2nd respondent. He denied the allegation that 1st respondent had

been given 22 sovereigns and Rs.1.50,000/- as dowry and those

were taken away by him. According to him he is a man of virtue

neither demanded any gold ornaments nor accepted any dowry.

At the time of marriage, the 1st respondent had 10 sovereigns of

gold ornaments only.         Neither the Revision Petitioner nor his

R.P.(F.C.) No. 257 OF 2012         3

relatives had ill treated the 1st respondent. He was a supplier in a

hotel abroad. The 1st respondent had gone to her parental house

only for the purpose of delivery and thereafter she had not shown

any interest to return to her matrimonial house. The Revision

Petitioner denied the allegation that he earns Rs.20,000/- per

month.         He had sent Rs.1,000/- to the 1st respondent during

July,2009 and she accepted the money.           He had also sent

Rs.5,000/- on 10.10.2010 and Rs.7,000/- on 11.12.2010. Though

the Revision Petitioner had sent notice and also a petition was

filed before the Family Court for Restitution of Conjugal Rights,

the 1st respondent even denied the Revision Petitioner's right to

see his child. So that he is living separately without valid reason.

The 1st respondent was examined as PW1 and the Revision

Petitioner was examined examined as RW1. Exts. B1 to B6 were

marked for the Revision Petitioner.

        4.     Going by the impugned order though the Revision

Petitioner claimed that he sent a notice requesting her to live

along with him and also filed petition before the Family Court

seeking Restitution of Conjugal Rights,      subsequently, he had

pronounced talaq and now the 1st respondent is a divorced Muslim

women. The above facts are admitted by both sides. Therefore,

R.P.(F.C.) No. 257 OF 2012        4

the question whether there are sufficient grounds to live

separately without forfeiting the right to claim maintenance from

the Revision Petitioner has no validity as the divorced women

and       the child born in that wed lock is also entitled to get

maintenance.

        5.     What remains is quantum of maintenance only. The

Revision Petitioner has deposed that while he was in abroad he

used to to get Rs.8,000/- per month towards salary. At present he

is doing sale of vegetables in a goods vehicle.  He admitted that

he is working under one Razak and he used to pay Rs.200/- to

him per day. Therefore, the case of the Revision Petitioner is that

he has no job or income is not correct. There is no evidence to

show his incapacity or inability to do any work so as to earn

livelihood. The admitted income of the Revision Petitioner will

come to Rs.6,000/- per month. Per contra, absolutely there is no

evidence to show that the respondents are able to maintain

themselves. The first respondent has no job or income. It is true

that the Revision Petitioner has another wife and child but, that is

not a reason to deny the claim of the respondents.            After

considering the income of the Revision Petitioner and the status

and living standard of respondents, the learned Family Court

R.P.(F.C.) No. 257 OF 2012           5

Judge directed the Revision Petitioner to pay Rs.1,500/- each for

the maintenance of the respondents.

        6.     I am of opinion that there is no illegality or impropriety

in such findings and the quantum of maintenance granted to the

respondents is just and proper. I find no reason to unsettle the

findings of the learned Family Court Judge, under revisional

jurisdiction of this Court.

        This R.P.(F.C.) is dismissed.

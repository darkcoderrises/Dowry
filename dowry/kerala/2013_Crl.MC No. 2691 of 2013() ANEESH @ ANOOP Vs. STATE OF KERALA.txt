                Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 2nd day of July, 2013.


                         O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the 4th accused in

S.C.No.372/08 of the Additional District and Sessions Judge

(Ad hoc) II, Kollam, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No. 44/07 of Chathannoor Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 143,

147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 308 read with section 149 of IPC,

with a prayer to quash Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure-A2

final report in   the above crime, which is pending as

L.P.No.35/2011 in the above court, as the matter is settled

out of court.

        2.   The allegation against the accused is that on

2.2.2007 at 10 p.m., they formed themselves into an

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013


unlawful assembly with deadly weapons came to the road

proceeding to Uliyanadu in Meenadu Village to commit

rioting and assaulted with 'idikatta' and sword, inflicting

cut injuries to the 2nd respondent, and as he changed his

position, caused injuries to his shoulder.      Thus, the

accused had committed the offences punishable under

sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 308 read with

section 149 of IPC.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.    The case of the petitioner, who is the 4th

accused, is that during the pendency of the above case,

the matter is settled out of court between himself and the

de facto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent, who

preferred       Annexure-A4   affidavit. Therefore,    the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings. Besides, the

above it is also the case of the petitioner that accused

                              3
Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013


nos.1 to 3 have faced the trial in S.C.No.372/08 and they

are acquitted as per the judgment dated 9.5.2011. I have

perused Annexure-A3 judgment. In paragraph 13 of the

judgment, the learned Judge has found that,

         "All the material witness including the injured
         turned hostile to the prosecution and nothing can
         be gathered from their evidence to connect the
         accused       with the   prosecution    allegation.
         Moreover, it is clear from their evidence that the
         matter is amicably settled out of court. After the
         examination of PW1 to PW6 the learned Public
         Prosecutor dispensed with the examination of the
         remaining witnesses since there was no scope for
         a successful prosecution.     So the court was
         constrained to close the evidence and due to lack
         of evidence, this point is found against the
         prosecution."

If that be so, according to me, the petitioner is also

entitled to get the similar treatment especially in the light

of the fact that the matter is settled out of court between

himself and the de facto complainant.

         5.    The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent

who on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

                             4
Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013


further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against the 2nd respondent.

         6.      I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 143,

147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 308 read with section 149 of

IPC, which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the

                                   5
Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013


counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the

de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

by them.        In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-




                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of
         its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised     in accord    with    the   guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the
         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any Court. In what cases power to
         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or
         F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would depend
         on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

                                 6
Crl.M.C.No.2691 of 2013


         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising       from   commercial,      financial,
         mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
         disputes where the wrong is basically private
         or personal in nature and the parties have
         resolved their entire dispute. In this category
         of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim,
         the possibility of conviction is remote and
         bleak and continuation of criminal case would
         put accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to him
         by not quashing the criminal case despite full
         and complete settlement and compromise with
         the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved  in   the   present     case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

                                7

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A1 FIR and Annexure A2 final report in Crime

No. 44/07 of Chathannoor Police Station and all further

proceedings         pending   against  the   petitioner in

S.C.No.372/08 of the Additional District and Sessions

Judge (Ad hoc) II, Kollam.

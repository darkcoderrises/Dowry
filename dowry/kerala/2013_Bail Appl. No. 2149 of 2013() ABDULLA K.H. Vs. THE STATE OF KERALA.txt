      Dated this the 7th day of June,2013


                     ORDER


    Petitioner is the accused in Crime 190/2013

of Bekal Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under section 498A of Indian

Penal Code.  He has filed the above application

seeking pre-arrest bail.

    2.   The above crime was registered on a

complaint  filed  by  the  wife  of  petitioner

before the Magistrate and that being referred

to  police   for   investigation  and   report.

Petitioner ill-treated his wife and demanded

He is alleged to have married again, and after

building of      complainant  intimidated and harassed

her is the further allegation.     Learned counsel for

petitioner submits petitioner aged 60 years married

the complainant in 1987 and in the wedlock six

children were born to them. Five among them are

surviving.       Eldest child is 21 years, is the

further submission of the counsel.         Allegations

imputed in the complaint are baseless and      another

proceeding      against  him   imputing  of   domestic

violence        too    is  pending,  is  the   further

submission of the counsel.

      3. De facto complainant has got impleaded as

additional second respondent in the proceedings.I

heard counsel for de facto complainant also.

      4. A copy of the complaint filed before the

Magistrate was handed over for my perusal.       After

looking      into the   allegations set  out  in   the

complaint and also the facts and circumstances

presented,       I   find    arrest   and    custodial

interrogation of petitioner in the present crime

which has arisen from the matrimonial disputes is

B.A.2149/2013              3

not essential.    Petitioner can be directed to co-

operate with the investigation of the crime.

       In the event of arrest of petitioner by police

in connection with the above crime he is directed

to be enlarged on bail on his executing a bond for

Rs.10,000/- with one solvent surety.        He shall

report before the investigating officer, if so

demanded, for smooth completion of investigation.

      Petition is allowed.

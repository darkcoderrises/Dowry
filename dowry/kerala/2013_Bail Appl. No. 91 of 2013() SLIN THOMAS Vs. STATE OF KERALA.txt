                             BA No.91 of 2013
               ----------------------------------------------------
               Dated this the 15th day of January 2013

                                     Order

              The petitioner is the first accused in Crime

No.441/12 of Ulikkal Police Station for having committed the

offences punishable under S.420 r/w S.34 IPC and S.4 of the

Dowry Prohibition Act. It seen that in fact, the entire family of

the petitioner was arrayed as accused and they approached

the lower court for anticipatory bail and the second and third

accused, who are the parents of the petitioner alone were

granted relief. The application as regards the petitioner was

dismissed.

              2. After having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, it is extremely

difficult to find as to how S.420 IPC would be attracted to the

facts of the case. Any way, a deeper probe into these matters

is not warranted at this point of time. The offence alleged under

the Dowry Prohibition Act, is a bailable offence.                  After having

given anxious consideration to the various aspects of the case,

it is felt that this is a fit case warranting exercise of the extra

BA 91/13                            2

ordinary jurisdiction of this court under S.438 of Cr.PC.

Accordingly, the application is allowed as follows :

1. The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating Officer

   on or before 22.01.2013, who, after interrogation, shall

   produce him before the JFCM concerned.

2. On an application being filed by the petitioner before the

   JFCM concerned, he shall be released on bail on his

   executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand

   only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

   satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

3. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

   sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts produced by

   the sureties before granting bail to the petitioner.

4. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as

   and when required by him, till final report is filed.

5. The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

6. If any of the conditions is violated, the bail granted shall

   stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied

BA 91/13                         3

  of the said fact, may take such steps as are available to him

  in law.

                      .................................................
                         Crl.M.C.No.1264 of 2014
                      ..................................................
               Dated this the 21st day of February, 2014.

                                   O R D E R




      This petition is filed by the accused 1 to 4 in C.C.No.872/12

(Crime No.176/12 of Aranmula police                    station) of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta                     to quash the proceedings

recording composition entered into between the petitioners and the

defacto complainant under Section 482 of the Code of                         Criminal

Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent/defacto complainant, Annexue A1

crime was registered as Crime No.176/12 alleging the offences

under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.     After investigation, final report was filed and the case

was taken on file as CC.872/12 and that is pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta. In the meantime, the

petitioners have settled their claim. They were students at the time

when the incident happened and their relationship has been restored

due to intervention of mediators and wellwishers. The defacto

complainant does not want to proceed with the prosecution against

the petitioners.    Since one of the offence is non-compoundable in

Crl.M.C.No.1264 of 2014                2

nature, they cannot file application for compounding before the

court below. So, they have no other option but to come to this

Court seeking interefence. Hence this petiton is filed seeking the

following relief:

          For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of
          hearing, it is prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be
          pleased    to  quash Annexure-1 FIR and its       further
          proceedings    as C.C.No.872/12 pending      before the
          Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta
          on the basis of Annexure-2 affidavit, to meet the ends of
          justice.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties due

to intervention of mediators and they have become friends and the

incident occured at the time when they were students and the defacto

complaint has filed an affidavit to that effect and he has no objection

in quashing the proceedings.

      4. As directed by this Court, on instructions, the learned Public

Prosecutor submitted that except           this case, there is no other case

against the petitioners and they have no criminal background and

the incident happened while they were                 students due to some

misunderstanding, but opposed the application.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of the

fact that the matter has been settled,             there is no possibility of

conviction. So he prayed for quashing the proceedings.

        6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement given

Crl.M.C.No.1264 of 2014                   3

by the second respondent Annexure-1 case was registered as Crime

No.176/2012 under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code and after investigation, final report was filed and

the case is now pending as C.C.No.872/2012 before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta. The matter has been now

settled between the parties.          They were students at the time when

the incident occured. They have now become friends and restored

their friendship on account of the settlement due to intervention of

their wellwishers and friends.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

held that:




             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
             commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
             like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
             relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
             wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
             parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
             cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
             view, because of the compromise between the offender and
             victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
             continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
             oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
             caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
             and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
             In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
             would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
             continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of
             the criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of
             process of law despite settlement and compromise between
             the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of

Crl.M.C.No.1264 of 2014                   4

             justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
             and if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
             the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash
             the criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties

and the defacto complainant himself has filed an affidavit stating

that the matter has been settled and he has no intention to prosecute

the case, there is no possiblity of any conviction being entered

against the petitioners,if this case is allowed to proceed with. Further

the incident occured at the time when they were students and on

account of the settlement, their friendship has been restored. So,

considering the circumstances, I feel that it is a fit case where power

under Section 482 of the Code has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings with a view to promote the friendship restored betwen

the petitioners and the defacto complainant on                     account of the

settlement and also to save judicial time in proceeding with the

case as no purpose will be served on account of the settlement in

proceeding with the case. So, the petition is allowed. The proceeding

in C.C.No.872/12 (Crime No.176/12 of Aranmula police station) now

pending     before      the   Judicial    First    Class    Magistrate     Court-I,

Pathanamthitta as against the petitioners is quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.1264 of 2014         5

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court immediately for further action.

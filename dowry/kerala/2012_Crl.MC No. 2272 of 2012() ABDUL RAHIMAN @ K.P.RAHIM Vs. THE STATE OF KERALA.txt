            ---------------------------------------
                 Crl.M.C. NO. 2272 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 05th day of November, 2012

                             ORDER


            Petitioners are the accused in a case pending on the

file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod. Though

the cases against the first petitioner, and that of the second

and third petitioners are numbered separately on the file of

the court, both cases arose on a report filed in a crime

registered on a complaint filed by the second respondent, who

is the wife of the first petitioner.   She has complained     of

matrimonial cruelty and harassment demanding dowry by her

husband and his close relatives, the other petitioners. Crime

registered, after investigation, led to indictment of the

petitioners, all of them, for the offence punishable under

Section 498(A) of the Indian Penal Code. On the submissions

made by the counsel on both sides that the parties have

settled the matter I have passed an order on 21.08.2012

directing the parties to appear before the Chief Judicial

Crl.M.C. NO. 2272 of 2012         2



Magistrate with further direction to that magistrate to enquire

and report whether the de facto complainant/wife has settled

the matter voluntarily and on free consent. After conducting

such enquiry as directed the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate

has sent a report that he is satisfied that the wife has effected

the compromise voluntarily and without influence from any

source. In the light of the report sent by the Chief Judicial

Magistrate and also the reasons already adverted to in the

previous order referred to above, I find continuation of the

criminal proceedings against the petitioners/accused is not

called for. Settlement effected by the parties can be given

effect to, to give a quietus to the controversy emerging from

the crime registered on the complaint of the wife. In that view

of the matter criminal proceedings against the first petitioner

in C.C. No. 276 of 2011 and against the second and third

petitioner in C.C. No. 616 of 2010, both on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod are quashed under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

                                        JUDGE.

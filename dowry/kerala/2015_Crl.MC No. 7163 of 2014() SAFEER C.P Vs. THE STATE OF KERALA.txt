                ===================
                CRL.M.C. No.7163 of 2014
               ====================
            Dated this the 23rd day of January, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.442 of 2013 of the

Chittarikkal Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A3 Final Report

and all further proceedings based on it, in C.C.No.1677 of

2014 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-II, Hosdurg, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners and the

other accused is that they have tortured and harassed the

defacto complainant, who is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and

treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A

CRL.M.C.No.7163 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

CRL.M.C.No.7163 of 2014
                                -: 3 :-



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A3

Final Report and all further proceedings based on it, in

C.C.No.1677 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg, are hereby quashed.

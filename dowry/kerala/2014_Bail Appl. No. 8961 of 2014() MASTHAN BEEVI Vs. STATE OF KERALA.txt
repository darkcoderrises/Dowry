                        B.A. No.8961 of 2014
           ...............................................................
           Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014

                                  O R D E R


     Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.     Petitioner         is     the      2nd      accused           in Crime

No.334/1999 of the Karunagapply Police Station, presently

pending as L.P.C.157/2008 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Karunagappaly, registered for the offence

punishable under Sections 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3.     The allegation against the petitioner is that she

along with the other accused had harassed and tortured the

defacto complainant who is the wife of the first accused and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry. The case

of the petitioner happens to be in the L.P. Register.

     4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

B.A.No.8961 of 2014
                               -: 2 :-



learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the CD.

      5.     It has come out that the petitioner is seriously laid

up due to various ailments in connection with her old age.

When non-bailable warrant is pending against the petitioner

and especially when the case has been transferred to the

L.P. Register, this Court is of the view that this is not a fit

case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted. At the same

time, the court below shall take note of the said aspects

when the petitioner surrenders before it, as and when she is

able to move.

      6.     All the main overt acts are alleged against the

first accused. Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not

required for any purpose at all. The petitioner is the aged

mother of the first accused. When the petitioner surrenders

before the court below or brought before the court below, the

court below shall consider the matter sympathetically and

pass appropriate orders on the same day itself in the bail

Application that may be filed by the petitioner.

closed.

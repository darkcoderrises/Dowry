                ------------------------------------
                    B.A. No. 2999 of 2013
                -----------------------------------
             Dated this the 31st day of May, 2013

                           O R D E R


     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Petitioners are the accused in Crime

No.151/2013 of the Mala Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498(A) r/w Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have harassed and tortured the defacto complainant, who

is the wife of the first petitioner and treated her with

cruelty by demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.           The crime has been

registered on the basis of a private complaint, filed by the

defacto  complainant      before     the   Judicial  First Class

Magistrate Court, Chalakkudy, which was referred to the

police under Section 156(3) of Cr.PC. The learned counsel

for the petitioners has pointed out that other litigations are

B.A. No. 2999 of 2013
                                2

pending between the parties, before the Family Court,

Irinjalakkuda. Considering all the above, I do not think that

the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is required for

the continued investigation of this case. Matter being so,

this is a fit case in which anticipatory bail can be granted to

the petitioners.

      4. In the result, this B.A. is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest

on each of them executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the

like sum each to the satisfaction of the officer conducting

arrest, and subject to the following terms and conditions.

      (1) The       petitioners   shall  report    before   the

Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all

Fridays and Mondays, commencing from 07.06.2013 for a

period of three months or till the filing of the final report in

B.A. No. 2999 of 2013
                               3

this case, which ever is earlier.

      (2) The petitioners shall not tamper with the evidence

or influence witnesses.

      (3) The petitioners shall make themselves available

for interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

Officer.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

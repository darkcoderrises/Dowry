                    Crl.M.C.No. 5338 of 2014
                       -------------------
         Dated this the day of 22nd September, 2014

                               O R D E R
        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners,

who are the accused in       C.C.No. 854 of 2014 on the file of the

Judicial First ClassMagistrate, Vatakara     which is a case instituted

upon the police report in Crime No. 158/2014 of Edachery

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 354, 406

and 498 A read with Sec. 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure - II charge      and all further proceedings thereon, as the

matter is settled out of court.

        2.    The allegation in the above case is that the first accused

married the de facto complainant on 4-10-2010 and after the

marriage they were residing together as husband and wife in the

Crl.M.C.No. 5338 of 2014
                                :-2-:

house of the accused. While so,      all the accused, demanding more

dowry, physically and mentally tortured the de facto complainant,

and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of

court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as

the XX respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case/crime, the matter is settled

amicably between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above crime/case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received     from the 2nd     respondent,

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant

Crl.M.C.No. 5338 of 2014
                                 :-3-:

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

she/he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.       In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case

are only under Sections 354, 406 and 498 A read with Sec. 34 IPC

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

Crl.M.C.No. 5338 of 2014
                                            :-4-:

the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the the de

facto     complainant            has    no     further       grievance        against     the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In

this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
           summarised thus:      the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
           distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with
           the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or
           (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
           the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
           and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
           civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
           particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,mercantile, civil,
           partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
           relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
           dispute.      In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender
           and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

Crl.M.C.No. 5338 of 2014
                                        :-5-:

         of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case
         despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

in the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable

in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste

of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure - II

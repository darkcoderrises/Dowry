               ------------------------------------
                   B.A. No. 3243 of 2013
               -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 31st day of May, 2013

                          O R D E R


     According to the petitioners they are apprehending

arrest in connection with Crime No.259/2013 of the

Kunnicode Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 406, 498(A) r/w Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who

is the wife of the first petitioner and treated her with

cruelty by demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the   learned  Public    Prosecutor.     The     learned Public

Prosecutor states that presently the petitioner alone is the

sole accused in the crime, and petitioners 2 and 3 have

been removed from the array of the accused. The crime

has been registered on the basis of a private complaint

filed by the defacto complainant, before the Judicial First

B.A. No. 3243 of 2013
                               2

Class Magistrate Court No.III, Punalur, which was referred to

the police under Section 156(3) of Cr.PC. Apart from the

usual allegations in a case like this, any specific instances

of harassment are not noted. Considering the facts and

circumstances of this case, and the present stage of

investigation, I do not think that the custodial interrogation

of the first petitioner is required for the continued

investigation of this case. Matter being so, I am of the view

that anticipatory bail can be granted to the first petitioner.

      4. In the result, this B.A. is allowed in part and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees Twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum

each to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions.

      (1) The petitioner shall report before the Investigating

B.A. No. 3243 of 2013
                               3

Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Fridays and

Mondays, commencing from          07.06.2013 for a period of

three months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

which ever is earlier.

      (2) The petitioner shall not tamper with the evidence

or influence witnesses.

      (3) The petitioner shall make themselves available for

interrogation as and when required by the Investigating

Officer.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

      As petitioners 2 and 3 are not accused in the crime, this

B.A. as far as petitioners 2 and 3 are concerned, stands

dismissed.

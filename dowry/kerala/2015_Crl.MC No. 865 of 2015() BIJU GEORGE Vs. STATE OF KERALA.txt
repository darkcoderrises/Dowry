                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           The accused in C.C.No.633/2014 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Harippad have

come under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting all further

proceedings in C.C.633/2014 pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Harippad, quashed.

      2.   The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      3.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the de facto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      4.   According to the petitioners, all the matters in

Crl.M.C.865/2015
                               : 2 :



dispute     between   the  petitioners  and    the   de  facto

complainant have been amicably settled and presently, the

de facto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners and, therefore, the proceedings against the

petitioners may be quashed.

      5.     The de facto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners and, hebce, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed.         She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the de facto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the de facto

complainant on her own volition.

      6.     Through the settlement, the petitioner and the 2nd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

Crl.M.C.865/2015
                               : 3 :



disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

de facto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioners, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings in C.C.633/2014 pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Harippad are hereby

quashed.

    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014
    ==============================
      Dated this, the 25th day of February, 2014.


                          O R D E R



     This is an application filed by accused in C.C.No.680/13

(Crime No.772/12 of Nilambur Police Station) on the files of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nilambur, to quash

the proceedings after recording the composition under Section

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are the

accused in Crime No.772/12 of Nilambur Police Station which

was registered on the basis of the statement given by second

respondent as de facto complainant alleging offences under

Sections.143, 147, 148, 323, 326 read with Section 149 of

Indian Penal Code.     Respondents 2 to 6 are the de facto

complainant and other injured witnesses in the case. The case

of the prosecution was that, on 29.08.2012, at about 5.30

p.m, while a bike race was going on under the auspicious of a

cultural event organized by a public library, the accused

persons made joyous noise and chaos and when organizers

and volunteers questioned the same, there was some scuffle

Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014         :  2 :

and altercation occurred and they have manhandled and

caused simple and grievous injuries to respondents 2 to 6 and

thereby, they have committed the above said offences and

after investigation, final report filed and it is taken as

C.C.No.680/13 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Nilambur. In respect of the same incident, another case

was registered as Crime No.773/12 against the present

respondents and that case was pending before the same court

as C.C.No.424/13. Both these cases were settled due to the

intervention of mediators and now harmony has been restored

between the petitioners and the respondents 2 to 6. Since

some of the offences are non compoundable in nature, they

could not file an application before the concerned magistrate

court for compounding or withdrawing the case. No purpose

will be served by proceeding with the case as well.

Respondents 2 to 6 have filed Crl.M.C.1325/14 before this

court for quashing the counter case.                    So, under the

circumstances, they have no other option but to approach this

court seeking the following relief:

      "To     quash     all  further    proceedings     against  the

      petitioners/Accused in CC 680/2013, pursuant to Annexure A1

      final report in Crime No.772/2012 of Nilambur Police Station in

      Malappuram district, in the interest of justice."

Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014      :  3 :

      3.     Respondents 2 to 6 appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and they have no objection in quashing the proceedings

and all the injured persons including the de facto complainant

have filed affidavits as Annexure A2 to A6.       Learned Public

Prosecutor, on instructions, as directed by this court,

submitted that except this case, there is no other case against

the petitioners but opposed the application.

      4.     It is an admitted fact that in respect of an incident

occurred on 29.08.2012, a crime was registered as Crime

No.772/12 against the present petitioners on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant alleging offences under Sections.143, 147, 148,

323, 326 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. It is

also an admitted fact that after investigation, Annexure A1

final report was filed and it was taken on file as file as

C.C.No.680/13 by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Nilambur and it is pending before that court.       It is also an

admitted fact that in respect of the same incident, another

crime was registered as Crime No.773/12 against respondents

2 to 6 herein and after investigation, final report was filed and

it was taken on file as C.C.No.424/13 by the same magistrate

Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014          :  4 :

and it is also pending before that court. The respondents 2 to

6 herein filed Crl.M.C.1325/14 for quashing the counter case

C.C.424/13. The matter has been settled between the parties.

All the injured persons have filed affidavit before this court

stating that they have settled the matter and now they are

living in cordial relationship and they do not want to proceed

the case.

      5.      In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108 (SC) which is held as follows:

              "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed.       However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard
      to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious
      offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
      dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
      victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have
      serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
      between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
      under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working in that
      capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
      criminal proceedings involving such offences.         But the
      criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly
      civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014           :   5 :

      financial,  mercantile,   civil,    partnership  or   such   like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
      to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is
      basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
      not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above question(s)
      is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



       6.    The Public Prosecutor submitted that there is no

other case against the petitioners and there is no criminal

background for them as well. It is seen from the allegations

itself that the incident happened on account of some

intervention caused to the bike race organized by a cultural

club, case and counter cases have been registered against both

the parties. They have settled the cases now. The cordial

relationship between the injured persons in both the cases who

were shown as de facto complainant and accused have been

restored due to the settlement arrived at on account of the

intervention of mediators and well wishers of both sides. In

view of the fact that the matter has been settled between the

Crl.M.C.No.1323 of 2014     :  6 :

parties, there is no possibility of any conviction being entered

into against the accused persons if the trial of the case is

allowed to continue and that will only cause wastage of judicial

time and nothing more.      So, considering the circumstances,

this court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings in order to promote the harmony that

has been restored between the parties on account of the

settlement arrived at between them due to the intervention of

well wishers and friends.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.680/13 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Nilambur (Crime No.772/12 of Nilambur Police Station)

is here by quashed.     Office is directed to communicate this

order to the concerned court for further action.

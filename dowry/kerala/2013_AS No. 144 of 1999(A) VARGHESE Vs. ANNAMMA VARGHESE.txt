Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan, J.



      This appeal is by the first defendant. He married the first

plaintiff on 23.6.1984. The second plaintiff was born to them.

The first plaintiff was in Uttar Pradesh and the first defendant

in Bangalore, for more than two years, virtually separated,

before Ext.B1 order of judicial separation was issued by the

Family Court, Bangalore on 12.1.1989, at the instance of the

first defendant in proceedings which the first plaintiff did not

contest. On 12.7.1989, the first defendant executed Ext.A3

sale deed purporting to transfer his share in the immovable

property covered by Ext.A2 to his mother, the third defendant.

Thereupon, the plaintiffs sued first defendant and his parents

A.S.144/99
                                 -:2:-

on different counts. They claimed maintenance and also that

plaint schedule item No.1 belongs exclusively to the first

plaintiff, whose funds were utilized for that purchase in the

name of the first plaintiff and the first defendant.

      2.    The court below decreed the suit in part granting

maintenance and setting aside Ext.A3 and granting recovery of

plaint schedule item No.1 covered by that document.

      3.    At the hearing of this appeal, the plea and

arguments on behalf of the appellant were confined to the

question as to the correctness of the impugned decree and

judgment in so far as it related to the setting aside of Ext.A3.

No other points argued.

      4.    The learned counsel for the appellant argued that

the evidence in the case categorically show that the claim of

the plaintiffs that money was entrusted to the first defendant is

unfounded. Similarly, the transfer made by the mother of the

first defendant to him and the first plaintiff was not supported by

any consideration from the hands of the first plaintiff, it was

A.S.144/99
                                 -:3:-

argued.   The learned counsel further argued that the court

below has acted illegally in the matter of appreciating the

evidence on record.

      5.  It was argued on behalf of the respondents that the

court below had before it materials that unequivocally showed

that funds belonging to the first defendant were utilised for the

purpose of the purchase of the property from the second

defendant, who is none other than the mother of the first

defendant. He also argued that it is totally improbable that the

second defendant, the first plaintiff's mother-in-law, would have

transferred property, also in the name of the daughter-in-law of

the first plaintiff; yet to continue to reside in the building

covered by the sale deed; unless the intention was only to

assure the first plaintiff that the money that came from her or

from her parents was being utilized and retained for her benefit.

He argued that there is no merit in the appeal.

      6.  The fact of the matter remains that after the marriage

on 23.6.1984, the third defendant, the mother of the first

A.S.144/99
                                   -:4:-

defendant executed Ext.A2 sale deed on 11.10.1985, whereby

she conveyed eight cents and a building stated to be with a

couple of rooms, jointly in the names of first plaintiff and the

first defendant. The consideration shown in that document is

Rs.2,000/-.     The first plaintiff's father Thomas is one of the

witnesses to that document. While the plaintiffs sued only after

the Ext.A3 sale by first defendant to his mother, the third

defendant, obviously, it has to be stated that the first defendant

has to be treated to have held and meddled with the property

covered by Ext.A2, including the rights of the first plaintiff and of

the first defendant, if any, in trust, on behalf of that couple

linked in marriage. Now, while the court below has found that

first plaintiff has proved having parted with an amount of

Rs.10,000/- in connection with Ext.A2 sale deed, the document

reflects only Rs.2,000/- as consideration and the first defendant

stands to admit even in his pleadings that he has taken

Rs.5,000/- towards marriage expenses from the parents of the

first plaintiff even prior to the marriage. If that were so, the

A.S.144/99
                               -:5:-

provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 stare at the

appellant. Not only that, on and after the coming into force of

Part B State Laws Act, 1951, the provisions in the Travancore

Christian Succession Act, 1092 do not continue to operate as

noticed by the Hon'be Supreme Court in Mary Roy v. State

of Kerala(1986 KLT 508). Therefore, there is no

provision enabling the bride or the groom taking to their

matrimonial home, what could be called as "Sreedhana" in

terms of the Travancore Christian Succession Act.      With this,

we also see that while making Ext.A2 transfer, the third

defendant had categorically stated that what she holds is title,

possession and residence and upon transfer, those rights are

being delivered to the first plaintiff and the first defendant

exclusively. But, the fact of the matter remains that the first

defendant and the third defendant; going by their pleadings,

and the materials on record, including the addresses on which

they were served with summons of the suit; continue to reside

at Kallelivilayil Veedu which is the building involved in Ext.A2.

A.S.144/99
                                 -:6:-

Under such circumstances, due regard being had to the

pleadings and evidence, we see that the preponderance of

probabilities emanating out of the totality of the aforesaid facts

and circumstances of the case, points only to the legitimate and

reasonable inference that the execution of Ext.A2 was evidently

to evidence the receipt of funds from the first plaintiff's home

and that is why her father was also made a witness to that

document. We do not see any other way to assimilate the true

nature of Ext.A2. If that were so, it has to be held that the first

defendant held that property only as a trustee on behalf of the

first plaintiff. Hence, we do not see any ground to interfere with

the impugned judgment and decree.

      In the result, this appeal is dismissed.      However, the

parties are directed to suffer their respective costs.

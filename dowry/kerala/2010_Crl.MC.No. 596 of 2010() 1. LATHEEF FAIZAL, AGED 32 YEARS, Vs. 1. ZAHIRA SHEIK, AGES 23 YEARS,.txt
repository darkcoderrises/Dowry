              Crl.M.C.No.596 of 2010
            --------------------------

                       ORDER



    Petitioners   are   the   accused   and   first

respondent, the complainant in C.C.No.275/2009 on

the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,

Kasaragod, taken cognizance for the offences under

Sections 498A, 403, 406 and 420 read with Section

34  of  Indian  Penal  Code  on  Annexure-A1  final

report. First petitioner is the husband of the

first respondent. This petition is filed under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure to quash

the proceedings contending that entire matrimonial

disputes between the parties were settled amicably

and in view of the settlement, it is not in the

interest of justice to continue the prosecution.

    2. First respondent appeared through a counsel

and  filed  a   joint  petition   along  with   the

petitioners   stating   that   entire   matrimonial

disputes were settled amicably and in view of the

CRMC 596/10                2


settlement, the case is to be quashed.

    3.     Learned   counsel   appearing   for   the

petitioners, first respondent and learned Public

Prosecutor were heard.

    4.     Annexure-A1  final   report  shows   that

prosecution    case  is   that  on  6.6.2002,  first

petitioner married first respondent and from the

date of marriage till 23.1.2009, petitioners were

demanding more dowry and treating her with cruelty

both physically and mentally and making the first

respondent    to  believe   that  property  will  be

purchased in the names of the first petitioner and

herself, money was induced to be parted by the

first respondent and in breach of trust, document

was  obtained    only  in  the  name  of  the  first

petitioner    and  he,   thereby,  cheated  her  and

committed the offences.

    5. Joint petition filed by the first respondent

with     the   petitioners   establishes  that  the

matrimonial    disputes  between  the  parties  were

CRMC 596/10              3


settled    amicably and  first respondent  has   no

subsisting grievance against the petitioners. As

held by the Apex Court in B.S.Joshi v. State of

Haryana ((2003) 4 SCC 675), when the matrimonial

disputes were settled between the parties, it is

not for the court to stand on technicalities and

proceed with the case on the ground that an offence

under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code is not

compoundable,    when  the   other  offences   are

compoundable. Hence, it is not in the interest of

justice to continue the prosecution.

     Petition is allowed. C.C.No.275/2009 on the

file    of   Chief  Judicial  Magistrate's   Court,

Kasaragod is quashed.

                           V.K. MOHANAN, J.
                   ......................................................
                         CRL.M.C.NO.3672 OF 2013
                   ......................................................
                Dated this the 30th day of August, 2013

                                 O R D E R

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 5 in                            Crime No.

956/2012 of Binanipuram Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 143,147,294(b) and 323 read with

Section 149 of I.P.C with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR as

the matter is settled out of court.

     2. The allegation in the above case is that on 26.12.2012 at

about 9.30 p.m the petitioners/accused assaulted the second

and third respondents and they sustained injuries. The defacto

complainant and the injured treated in the Government

Hospital, Aluva. The police registered the aforesaid crime on

the strength of the statement given by the defacto complainant.

Thus, the accused has committed the offences punishable under

Sections 143,147,294 (b) and 323 read with Section 149 of

IPC. Now the case of the third petitioner is that during the

pendency of the above case, the entire dispute is settled with

the second respondent, who is the defacto complainant and

the third respondent, who is one of the injured, were

                         +++++++++++++-+9+**-


respectively sworn into Annexures A2 and A3 affidavits and

now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out

of court.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that,

during the pendency of the above crime, the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in

the above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

     5.   The learned counsel for the second respondent, who

on the basis of the specific instruction received from the second

respondent, submitted that the above respondent, who is the de

facto complainant, does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

     6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A2 and       A3 affidavits.      In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

                          +++++++++++++-+9+**-


settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

     7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only sections 143,147,294(b),323 and 149 IPC which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the second respondent, it appears to

me that the the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

              "57. The position that emerges from the

        above discussion can be summarised thus: the

        power of the High Court in quashing a

        criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

        exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

                           +++++++++++++-+9+**-


         and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences

         under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of

         wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but

         it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

         abuse of the process of any Court. In what

         cases power to quash the criminal proceeding

         or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their

         dispute would depend on the facts and

         circumstances of each case and no category

         can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But  the   criminal     cases   having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes    of   quashing,      particularly  the

          offences      arising     from       commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences arising

          out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

          family disputes where the wrong is basically

          private or personal in nature and the parties

          have resolved their entire dispute.        In this

          category of cases, High Court may quash

                         +++++++++++++-+9+**-


        criminal proceedings if in its view, because of

        the compromise between the offender and

        victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

        and bleak and continuation of criminal case

        would put accused to great oppression and

        prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal

        case despite full and complete settlement and

        compromise with the victim........"

        8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute.   It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.    Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

                         +++++++++++++-+9+**-


as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A1and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in Crime No.956/2012 of Binanipuram         Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

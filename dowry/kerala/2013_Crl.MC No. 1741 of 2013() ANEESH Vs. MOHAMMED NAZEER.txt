         Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
         ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 24th day of June, 2013

                         O R D E R

                 As the parties to the above M.C's are one

and same and especially when the above petitions are arouse

out of case and counter case and when the subject matters

are also same, the above two M.C are heard together and

being disposed by this common order.

        2. Crl.M.C.No.1741/2013 is preferred by the accused

in C.C.No.205/2008 which is instituted upon the report in

Crime No.517/2007 of Kadakkal Police Station were the

defacto complainant is the first respondent in the above M.C.

The offence alleged therein are only under Section 341, 294

(b),  323   and    r/w   Section   34  of   IPC.   Where  as

M.C.No.1752/2013 is directed against the proceedings in

S.C.No.1160/2011 on the files of the Court of Assistant

Sessions Judge, Kottarakkara which was eventually instituted

on the basis of a final report in Crime No.514/2007 of

Kadakkal Police Station and said M.C is filed by the accused

Nos.1 to 7 in the above crime and the respondents in this M.C

are the defacto complainant and the injured persons.

Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
                                  2

          3.         Both the counsel for the petitioners and the

contesting respondents submitted that the incidents in the

above two crimes occurred connected with a disputes as the

school bus reached the spot delayedly and the same was

questioned by the parents who are the accused in one case

and the victim therein are the staff of the bus. Connected with

the same this counter crime registered. Now, the case of the

petitioners and respondents is that the matter is settled out of

court.

          4.         Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the respondents.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          5.         The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above crimes, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the dispute

which is the subject matter of the above crimes. Therefore,

the continuation of the proceedings in the above crimes are

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          6.         The learned counsel for the respondents who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who is the

Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
                                   3

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and they have no grievance against

them.

          7.         I   have   carefully considered   the above

submissions of the respective counsel.        I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petitions. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the

parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also

no objection in allowing the above petitions.

          8.         Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in these cases, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above cases are only Sections 341, 294(b), 323

and r/w Section 34 of IPC. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the respondents, it appears to me that the the de facto

complainants have no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
                                     4

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
                                      5

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present cases and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present cases.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

Crl.M.C.Nos. 1741 & 1752 of 2013
                                  6

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.'s can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, these Crl.M.C's are allowed, quashing in

Crime Nos. 517/2013 & 514/2007 of Kadakkal Police Station

and all further proceedings thereto.

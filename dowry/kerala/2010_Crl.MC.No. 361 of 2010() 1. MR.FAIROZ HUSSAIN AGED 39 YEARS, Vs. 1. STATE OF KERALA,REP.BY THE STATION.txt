                                   ORDER

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C

seeking to have all further proceedings in C.C No.607/2009 on the

file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasargod which

relates to Crime No.359/2008 of the Kumbala Police Station,

Kasargod quashed.

           2. Petitioner is an accused in C.C No.607/2009 before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasargod for having

committed offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and 323 of

IPC. Petitioner had married Dilshad Bhanu on 08/04/2007 as per

custom prevailing in their community and were residing together.

The allegation against the petitioner is that he has been

harassing, torturing and treating his wife cruely demanding more

dowry. Private complaint was filed by the defacto-complainant

which is produced as Annexure A1.                       In the light of the

investigation, final report was filed. Cognizance was taken by the

court. Petitioner could not respond to the summons as he was

working outside Kerala, in fact at Bangalore.                       Therefore

Crl.M.C No.361 OF 2010             Page numbers


subsequent proceedings were taken and proceedings under

Section 82 and 83 were resorted to. Even though the petitioner

moved this court for anticipatory bail, that was dismissed

directing the petitioner to surrender before the court below. The

only prayer made at the time of hearing of this petition is that in

case the petitioner surrenders before the court below and moves

an application for bail, that would be considered on the very same

day itself.

             3. In the result, this petition is disposed of directing

the court below to consider the bail application to be filed by the

petitioner in case of his surrender before the court below on the

day which the bail application is filed, after serving notice to the

learned Public Prosecutor.

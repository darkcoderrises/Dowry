                      K. RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 27th day of March, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This    is  a   petition        filed      by      the      sole  accused    in

C.C.No.291/2010 now pending as L.P.No.14/2012 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara to quash

the proceedings on account of the settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the sole

accused in    Crime No.180/2010 of Kurathikad                         police station

which was registered on the basis of a statement given by the

second respondent alleging               the offence under Section 325 of

the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed

and it was taken on file as C.C.No.291/2010 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara and later it

was transferred to register of long pending cases and pending

as L.P.No.14/2012 before that court. Now the matter has been

settled between the parties and the defacto complainant does not

want to prosecute the petitioner. No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as well in view of the settlement. The

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014               2

petitioner has no other option except to approach this Court

seeking the following relief:

            Therefore it is humbly prayed that for these and other

            reasons to be urged at the time of hearing, it is most

            humbly prayed that this    Honourale    Court may be

            pleased to pass an order to quash Annexure-A1 charge

            sheet in    Crime No.180/2010 of    Kurathikad police

            station in C.C.No.291/2010 and L.P.No.14/2012 on the

            file   of   Judicial First Class Magistrate   Court-I,

            Mavelikara.


       3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he has no objection in allowing the application. He has

filed Annexure A2 affidavit stating these facts.


      4. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction. So

he prayed for allowing the application.

      5. The learned        Public Prosecutor,      on    instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner. But he was a police personnel and no

departmental action has been taken against the petitioner, but

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014           3

opposed the application.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent/defacto complainant a crime

was     registered as    CrimeNo.180/2010 of     Kurathikad police

station against the petitioner alleging the offence under Section

325 of the Indian          Penal Code and after investigation,

Annexure A1 final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.291/2010 on the file of the Judicial            First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara. The petitioner did not appear

during the course of proceedings and the case was transferred

to register of long pending cases        and it is now pending as

L.P.No.14/2012 of that court. Now the matter has been settled

between the parties.        The defacto complainant        has no

complaint against the petitioner now and he does not want to

prosecute the petitioner as well.     Further, it is seen from the

allegations in the final report itself that the incident happened

in a toddy shop when toddy was not given to the petitioner on

credit.    However, the matter has been now settled between the

parties. No purpose will be served by proceeding with the case

as well.     It is true that the person working    in the    police

department should not have involved in such cases. But, now

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014                  4

he is repenting for what he had done and that was forgiven by

the defacto complainant           as well.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

             quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

             compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

             oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

             caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

             full and complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim. In other words, the High Court must consider

             whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

             justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014                   5

             continuation   of   the    criminal    proceedings   would

             tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement

             and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and

             whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate

             that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to

             the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court

             shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

             proceeding."


       8. In view of the dictum laid down above decision and also

considering the fact that the matter has been settled between

the parties and the petitioner has repented for what he has

done     and         the   second       respondent/defacto         complainant

prepared to forgive the petitioner for his act, which happened

in    the     toddy shop and no              purpose will be served        by

proceedings with this case as this Court feels that it is a fit

case where power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure        has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to

save the time of court.


      9. So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

L.P.No.14/2012 (Crime No.180/2010 of Kurathikad police

station and C.C.No.291/2010)now pending                   before the Judicial

Crl.M.C.No.1624 of 2014              6

First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikara is quashed as

against the petitioner.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court for further necessary action in this regard.

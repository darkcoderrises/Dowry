         Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

     The petitioners are accused in C.C.No.1222/13 on the

file of the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-

Kunnamangalam, and they filed the above petition under

section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A1

complaint, Annexure A2 FIR and Annexure A3 charge sheet

and all further proceedings in C.C.No.1222/13 pending

against them, on the ground that, the entire dispute has

been settled with the 2nd respondent who is the de facto

complainant.

     2.  Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     3. The prosecution allegation is that the 1st petitioner

married the second respondent on 18.5.2008 according to

Hindu customs and lived together as husband and wife.

Crl.M.C.No.4121 of 2014
                               2

During the matrimonial life, the accused ill treated the 2nd

respondent with cruelty demanding more cash and gold. It

is also alleged that the 1st petitioner married her

suppressing the fact that he could not be a father. She

alleged that she was subjected to mental and physical

cruelty by the petitioner.      On the basis of the above

allegation, the 2nd respondent herein preferred Annexure

A1 complaint in the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-

Kunnamangalam, which was transferred under section 156

(3) of Cr.P.C. to the Kunnamangalam Police Station, and

Crime No.378/13 was registered therein and on completing

the investigation, Annexure 3 report was filed by

incorporating the offences punishable under sections 406,

420, 498 A, r/w 34 of IPC against the petitioners.

      4. Now, the case of the petitioners as well as the 2nd

respondent is that the entire dispute has been settled and

the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent are decided to put

an end to their marital relationship and the 2nd respondent

do not propose to prosecute the criminal case against the

Crl.M.C.No.4121 of 2014
                                    3

petitioners.      The 2nd respondent has also sworn into an

affidavit dated 15.7.2014 to that effect and the same is

produced as Annexure A5. It is stated that in pursuance to

the settlement arrived, a joint application for divorce was

filed in the Family court, Kozhikode and it is also stated

therein that the 2nd respondent has no objection in

quashing the proceedings pending against the petitioners.

In the above facts and circumstances of the case, I am of

the view that, as the parties to the dispute, have settled the

matter, it is only just and proper to allow this petition,

otherwise no purpose will be served, if the trial is

proceeded against          the petitioners. Accordingly, this

petition can be allowed, in view of the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

Crl.M.C.No.4121 of 2014
                                   4

         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power   to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly       and  pre-dominatingly      civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

           In the result, this M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A1 complaint, Annexure A2 FIR in Crime

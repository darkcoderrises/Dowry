          ----------------------------------------
          Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 30th day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R

         As the parties to the above M.Cs are more or less

same and especially when the above petitions are arouse out

of case and counter case and when the subject matters are

also same, the above two M.C are heard together and being

disposed by this common order.

         2. The accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime No.111/2010 of

Kadakkal      Police     Station,      are     petitioners    in

Crl.M.C.No.3169/2013 and the above crime was registered at

the instance of the second respondent herein and the 3rd

respondent is one of the injured in the above crime, who are

the accused in Crime No.109/2010 of the very same Police

Station and the defacto complainant therein and the injured

are respectively respondents 2 and 3, who are accused Nos.1

and 2 in Crime No.111/2010.

         3. As I indicated earlier as the above sessions cases

are instituted upon in the reports in two different crimes which

are case and counter, and while the above cases are pending

before the Court below for trial, the matter is settled between

Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
                                 2

the contesting parties and now both of them are not having

any grievance and they do not want to proceed with the

prosecution any further. In Crl.M.C.No.3169/2013, the second

respondent, defacto complainant has sworn into Annexure-3

affidavit and similarly Annexure-4 affidavit has sworn into by

3rd respondent, who is injured. In Crl.M.C.No.3170/2013, the

defacto complainant therein who is the second respondent and

the injured who is the 3rd respondent are respectively sworn

into Annexure-A3 and A4 affidavit.

         4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crimes, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which are

the subject matter of the above crimes. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crimes are abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         6. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, does not intend to

Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
                                 3

proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no

grievance against them.

         7. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petitions.      In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petitions.

         8.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in these cases, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above cases are only Sections 143, 147, 148,

323, 308 and r/w Section 149 of IPC. which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.    It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the the

de facto complainants have no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
                                     4

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:           the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the    criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
                                     5

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present cases and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present cases.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

Crl.M.C.Nos. 3169 & 3170 of 2013
                                 6

following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.s can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, these Crl.M.C.s are allowed, quashing A2

final report in Crime Nos.111/2010 & 109/2010 of Kadakkal

Police Station and all further proceedings thereto, respectively

in S.C.No.61/2012 and S.C.No.1480/2011, on the file of the

Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Kottarakara.

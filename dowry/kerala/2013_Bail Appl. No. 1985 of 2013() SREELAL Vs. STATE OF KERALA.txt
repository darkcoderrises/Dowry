            Dated this the 27th day of March, 2013

                             O R D E R



      Petitioner is the 1st accused in Crime No.301 of 2013 of

Paravur Police Station registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.   The other accused in the crime are stated to be the

parents of petitioner and they have been enlarged on bail by the

Magistrate, is the submission of counsel for petitioner.



      2. Learned counsel for petitioner submits that petitioner is

younger by four years to de facto complainant, the wife. While

petitioner was a minor, the de facto complainant and petitioner

eloped and a crime was registered over the missing of the girl.

Police, after securing her presence, produced her before the

Magistrate. Recording her statement and taking note that she is

a major and no offence made out, she was released.

Subsequently, after petitioner became major, both of them

married under the Special Marriage Act on 13.02.2013. A few

B.A.NO.1985/2013                 2




days later, that is, 12 days after the marriage, according to

counsel, alleging matrimonial cruelty imputing of demand for

dowry by petitioner and his parents, the above crime was

registered on a statement recorded from the wife/de facto

complainant.     Allegations raised against petitioner and his

parents to impute the aforesaid offence are baseless is the

submission of counsel to urge for granting him anticipatory bail.

Learned Public Prosecutor, after getting instructions, reports

that submissions made with respect to registration of the prior

case and also the marriage performed under the Special

Marriage Act are true to facts. Now, the investigation is going

on over the allegations made by de facto complainant and

whether petitioner or his parents are culpable of the offence

imputed can be decided only in such investigation, for which,

interrogation of petitioner is a must is the submission of learned

Public Prosecutor.



     3. Having regard to the submissions made and taking note

of the facts and circumstances presented, I find, in the given

facts of the case, custodial interrogation of petitioner is not a

B.A.NO.1985/2013                 3




must for a fair investigation.       Petitioner, however, has to

co-operate with the police in the investigation of the crime. In

the event of arrest of petitioner in the crime, he is directed to be

released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- (Rupees

Ten thousand only).       Petitioner shall co-operate with the

investigation and report before the Investigating Officer if his

presence is demanded for the purpose of investigation.



     Subject to the above direction, the petition is allowed.

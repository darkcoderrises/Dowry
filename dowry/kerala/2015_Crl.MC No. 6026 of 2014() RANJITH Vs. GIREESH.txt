                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners         are      the       accused         in   Crime

offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal

Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-C final report in Crime No.521/2011 of

Viyyur Police Station as against the petitioners and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1578/2011 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thrissur,

quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the wife of the 1st petitioner and

Crl.M.C.6026/2014
                              : 2 :



treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A

IPC, by demanding more dowry.           The wife of the 1st

petitioner committed suicide by hanging.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for respondents 1 to 3, and learned Public

Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and respondents 1 to 3

have been amicably settled and presently, respondents 1 to

3 have no complaints against the petitioners and, therefore,

the proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      7.     Respondents 1 to 3, who are the brother, mother

and sister of the deceased, have filed affidavits affirming

that all the matters in dispute between them and the

petitioners have been amicably settled and, therefore, they

have no complaints against the petitioners and, therefore, all

further proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed. Respondents 1 to 3 have entered appearance

Crl.M.C.6026/2014
                                : 3 :



through their counsel. The learned counsel for respondents

1 to 3 also endorses the fact that the affidavits have been

sworn in by the said respondents on their own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as respondents 1 to 3 have

no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-C

final report in Crime No.521/2011 of Viyyur Police Station as

against the petitioners and all further proceedings based on

it in C.C.1578/2011 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Thrissur are hereby quashed.

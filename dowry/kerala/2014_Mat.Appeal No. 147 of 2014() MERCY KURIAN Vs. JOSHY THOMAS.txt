                   Mat.Appeal No.147 Of 2014
                  ---------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of September, 2014.

Harun-Ul-Rashid, J.

      The petitioner in O.P.No.112/2012 on the file of the

Family Court, Kalpetta is the appellant. The appeal is directed

against the final order dated 31.12.2013. The appellant as

petitioner filed the O.P seeking divorce under Section 10(1)(X)

of the Divorce Act. The Family Court, by the impugned order,

dismissed the O.P finding that the petitioner is not entitled to a

decree of divorce on the ground of desertion and cruelty.

Parties are hereinafter referred to as referred in the O.P.

      2.   The petitioner and respondent are husband and

wife.    Their marriage was solemnized on 11.10.2010.

According to the petitioner, from the early days of marriage,

the respondent behaved in a strange manner. It is alleged by

the petitioner that the respondent started behaving cruelly

towards the petitioner and harass her mentally. It is alleged

that the respondent took pleasure in insulting the petitioner in

front of others stating that she is fatty. It is further averred

that the respondent deliberately withdrawn from cohabitation

and abandoned the petitioner without sufficient reasons. It is

                              ::2::

stated that the respondent left the company of the petitioner

on 26.10.2011 and thereafter the parties are living separately.

It is stated by her that the relationship of the petitioner and

respondent as husband and wife was ceased since the

respondent left the company of the petitioner on 26.10.2011.

      3.    The respondent remained absent. Accordingly, he

was set ex-parte. The petitioner was examined as PW1 and

Exts.A1 & A2 were marked. PW1 testified before the court in

terms of the averments in the O.P. She narrated the incidents

pleaded in the O.P.      On the basis of her solitary and un-

controverted evidence the learned Judge should have passed a

decree granting divorce. Instead the court declined the reliefs

stating that the ground of cruelty is not proved.

      4.    We heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned counsel for the respondent.      The petitioner pleaded

several incidents of cruelty that lead to severance of

relationship as husband and wife. It is inter alia stated that

her life in the matrimonial home was miserable and that her

husband and his mother forced her to quit the matrimonial

home. It is also alleged that the respondent and his mother

treated her with cruelty demanding more dowry and sleeping

                               ::3::

Mat.Appeal No.147 Of 2014

pills were administered through her food with an intention to

endanger her life and she was hospitalised. Testimony of the

petitioner in tune with the O.P was not controverted by the

respondent either by cross-examination or by adducing

independent evidence. The respondent chose to remain ex-

parte.   Though he appeared before the court and attended

counselling and mediation, the respondent failed to file counter

to the O.P and he remained absent throughout the case. In

the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view

that uncontroverted allegations proved through PW1 would

establish cruelty and therefore the petitioner is entitled to a

decree of divorce.

      In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order

is set aside.      The marriage between the petitioner and

respondent is dissolved by a decree of divorce. No order as to

costs.

                                           HARUN-UL-RASHID,
                                                  Judge.




                                         ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                 Judge.

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report in

Crime No.393/2002 of Kannur City Police Station as against

the petitioner and all further proceedings based on it in

L.P.158/2005 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A

Crl.M.C.6592/2014
                              : 2 :

entire gold ornaments and money.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto  complainant,     who    is the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel. The learned

                                : 3 :



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

Final Report in Crime No.393/2002 of Kannur City Police

                     ----------------------------------------
                   Crl.M.C.Nos. 2587 & 2588 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 27th day of June, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                   The petitioners in the above two Crl.M.Cs. are accused

in Crime No.596 of 2007 of Pattambi Police Station where the offences

alleged are under Sections 143,147,148,341,324 and 308 read with

Section 149 I.P.C.   According to the petitioners, there is a counter case

i.e.,Crime No.597 of 2007 in which the second respondent herein, who is

the de facto complainant in the present crime is the accused. In the said

counter case, the only offence alleged is under Section 324 which was

compounded as per the settlement arrived into between the accused and

the de facto complainant. Now, the case of the petitioners is that since

non-compoundable offences are involved in the present crime, i.e., Crime

No.596 of 2007, the same cannot be compounded.                Therefore, they

preferred the above MCs. with a prayer to quash all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.P.No.21 of 2011 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pattambi and C.C.No.1519 of 2013

Crl.M.C.Nos.2587 & 2588 of 2013
                                   :-2-:

pending before the same court, especially when the matter is settled out of

court.

         2. Heard the counsel for the petitioners as well as the learned

counsel appearing for the respondents in both the above cases.

         3. Crime No.596 of 2007 was registered at the instance of the

second respondent herein on the allegation that the accused at about 8 p.m.

on 17.11.2007 attacked the de facto complainant, while he was walking

and reached at Neduvattam Madras Quarters, by using deadly weapons and

thereby committed the said offences. Connected with the same incident, a

counter case is registered as Crime No.597 of 2007 where the second

respondent herein is the accused where the third petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.2587 of 2013 is the third accused in Crime No.596 of 2007.

Now the case of the petitioner is that as the counter case has already been

compounded, proceedings pending against the petitioners may be quashed

in the light of the amicable settlement arrived into between the parties. In

both the above MCs., the second respondent has filed an affidavit dated

22.6.2013.

Crl.M.C.Nos.2587 & 2588 of 2013
                                  :-3-:

         4. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.        I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         5. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 143,147,148,341,324 and 308 read with Section 149 I.P.C

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/accused

in the light of the settlement arrived by them.

Crl.M.C.Nos.2587 & 2588 of 2013
                                          :-4-:

          6. In the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                    "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

          Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

Crl.M.C.Nos.2587 & 2588 of 2013
                                             :-5-:

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

Crl.M.C.Nos.2587 & 2588 of 2013
                                  :-6-:

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the

court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, these Criminal M.Cs. can be allowed granting the relief as

sought for.

         In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed quashing the

proceedings in C.P.No.21 of 2011 on the file of the JFCM Court, Pattambi

and also Anenxure A1 FIR and Annexure A4 final report in Crime No.596

of 2007 of Pattambi Police Station and the proceedings in Crime

No.596/2007 of Patttambi Police Station and C.C.No.1519 of 2013

pending before the JFCM Court, Pattambi including Annexure A1 FIR and

Annexure A4 final report.

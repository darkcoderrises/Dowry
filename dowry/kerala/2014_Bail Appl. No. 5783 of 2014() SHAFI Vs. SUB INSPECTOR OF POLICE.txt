                    B.A.No.5783 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
         Dated this the 5th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R

        The petitioner herein is the 1st accused in Crime

No.652/14    of    Kareelakulangara        Police Station and

apprehending arrest connected with the above crime, he

preferred this application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. for

an order of pre-arrest bail.

     2.   The allegation of the prosecution is that the

petitioners ill-treated the de facto complainant physically

as well as mentally demanding dowry and have also

misappropriated the gold ornaments and money given to

her by her parents at the time of marriage. It is specifically

alleged that on 16.4.2012 at about 9.30 p.m., the first

accused with a demand to procure more dowry from her

house, hit her with a torch and second and third accused

also joined in the assault by beating her on her back and

B.A.No.5783 of 2014
                               2

chest.    So, according to the prosecution, the petitioner

along with other accused have committed the offences

punishable under sections 498A, 324, 406 r/w 34 of IPC.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the other accused in the very same crime were

granted anticipatory bail by the court below as per

Annexure A2 order. So, according to the learned counsel,

the petitioner is also entitled to get the same treatment. It

is also the submission of the learned counsel that the

petitioner had also pronounced 'Talak' divorcing the de

facto complainant and his marriage with another lady is

scheduled to be held on 10.8.2014 and therefore it is

submitted that the petition may be allowed.        It is also

pointed out by the learned counsel that though the incident

was taken place on 16.4.2012, the de facto complainant

approached the court during the year 2014 only and there

B.A.No.5783 of 2014
                              3

is two years' delay. On the other hand, the learned Public

Prosecutor submitted that the specific overtact alleged

against the petitioner is that during night at about 9.30, on

16.4.2012, the petitioner herein demanding to procure

more dowry from her house, hit her with a torch.          So,

according to the learned Public Prosecutor, the other

accused are on different footing and therefore the

petitioner is not entitled to get anticipatory bail especially

when there is specific overtact alleged against the

petitioner.

     5. I have carefully considered the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned Public prosecutor.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor made available to

me the CD file and it can be seen that the petitioner was

medically examined at 12.50 p.m. on 5.5.2012, ie.,

immediately after 2 weeks from the date of the alleged

incident in the Government Hospital, Harippad and in the

B.A.No.5783 of 2014
                               4

Accident Cum Wound Certificate, the Medical Officer has

noted certain injuries on the de facto complainant. It is

seen recorded that the injured was assaulted by her

husband on 16.4.2014. Thus it can be seen that there is

specific allegation against the petitioner and he had

assaulted the de facto complainant by using a torch. If that

be so, it is not proper for this Court to grant anticipatory

bail to the petitioner, since the same is likely to adversely

affect the investigation, which is in progress.

     In the result, this petition is devoid of any merit and

accordingly the same is dismissed.

             Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                            JUDGMENT

     Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.1358 of 2013

of Sreekaryam Police Station. It has been registered for the

offences under Sections 498A, 377, 323 read with 34 IPC,

Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and Section 66(E) of

the Information Technology Act. In the course of investigation

the police seized from his custody certain articles including a

laptop, a mobile phone and a pen drive. He filed CMP No.946

of 2014 before the learned Magistrate for custody of the

laptop, mobile phone and pen drive by the impugned order.

The learned Magistrate dismissed the petition on the ground

that they are in the custody of the Forensic Science

Laboratory. The prayer is to quash the impugned order.

     2.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

     3.    It is submitted that the petitioner is doing MDS

course and he would like to get certain photographs available

in the laptop. These photographs are allegedly of patients. He

needs them for case study. I think the prayer is reasonable.

The third respondent is directed to give the petitioner copies

of the folders containing the photographs of patients recorded

CRL.M.C No.2563 OF 2014

in the laptop and in the pen drive, which are said to be part

of his thesis. The petitioner shall take the second respondent

investigating officer to the Forensic Science Laboratory for

obtaining copies on CDs. The investigating officer officer shall

make necessary arrangements for the petitioner getting

copies of the documents mentioned above.          The petitioner

shall meet all the expenses.

    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1358 of 2014
    ==============================
             Dated this, the 01st April, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1 to 3 in

C.C.No.150/13 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannoor, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.150/13 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannoor. The case was

originated on the basis of the statement given by the second

respondent as de facto complainant alleging offences under

Sections 341, 323 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code

against the petitioners and on that basis, Annexure A1 First

Information Report was registered as Crime No.1035/12

alleging above offences. After investigation, Annexure A2 final

report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.150/13 and

that is pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Payyannoor. The matter has been now settled between the

parties. The incident occurred due to some misunderstanding

Crl.M.C.No.1358 of 2014        :  2  :

between the petitioners and the de facto complainant which

has been now resolved due to the intervention of mediators.

No purpose will be served by proceeding with the case in view

of the settlement. So, they have no other option except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

            To call for the records and quash the proceedings in

      Annexure A1 FIR and Annexure A2 Final report in Crime

      No.1035/2012 of Pazhayangadi Police which is now

      pending as in C.C.No.150/2013 on the file of the JFCM

      Court, Payyannur in the interest of justice."

      3.     The second respondent appeared through Counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and they have no intention to proceed with the case

and he had filed Annexure A3 affidavit to that effect.          The

Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of the

settlement, no purpose will be served in proceeding with the

case.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioners and they have no criminal

background but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

Crl.M.C.No.1358 of 2014        :  3  :

complainant, Annexure A1 First Information Report was

registered as Crime No.1035/12 of Pazhayangadi Police Station

and after investigation, Annexure A2 final report was filed and

it was taken on file as C.C.No.150/13 and pending before

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannoor. The matter

has been settled between the parties which is evident from

Annexure A3 affidavit filed by the de facto complainant. It is

also mentioned that due to some misunderstanding that the

incident occurred and now that has been resolved and he does

not want to prosecute the case. In view of the settlement,

even if the case is allowed to proceed with, conviction will not

be possible as the de facto complainant or his witnesses will

not support the case of the prosecution as it will only be a

wastage of judicial time.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

Crl.M.C.No.1358 of 2014         :  4   :

      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute    would    depend   on   the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.             Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7.     Considering the dictum laid down in the above

Crl.M.C.No.1358 of 2014     :    5 :

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties due to the intervention of

mediators and no purpose will be served in allowing the

prosecution to continue with the trial of the case as the de

facto complainant or his witnesses will not support the case of

the prosecution and conviction in such cases will be remote,

this court feels that it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings as proceeding with the trial will only

amount to wastage of judicial time.

       So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.150/2013 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannoor (Crime No.1035/12 of Pazhayangadi Police

Police Station) against the petitioners is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Payyannoor, for necessary further action in

this regard.

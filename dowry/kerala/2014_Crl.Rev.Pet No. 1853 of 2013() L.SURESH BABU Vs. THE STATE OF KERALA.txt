                     Crl.R.P. No.1853 of 2013
              -----------------------------------------------
                      Dated 17th March, 2014


                               O R D E R


             This Criminal Revision Petition is filed by the

petitioner/accused in C.M.P.No.8227/12 in C.C.No.525/12 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate I, Nedumangad.

             2.  C.M.P.No.8227/12 in C.C.No.525/12 was filed by

the accused in that case under Section 239 of the Cr.P.C.

seeking discharge from the case.            The accused was charge

sheeted under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.             The

prosecution case is that the accused treated CW1, his wife with

cruelty, demanding more dowry and assaulted her.                 The

revision petitioner filed C.M.P.No.8227/12 under Section 239

Cr.P.C. for discharge, which was dismissed on the ground that

there is prima facie evidence to establish the offence under

Section 498A against the accused.             Against that order, the

petitioner/accused filed this Criminal Revision Petition.

             3.  During the pendency of this Criminal Revision

Petition, the revision petitioner filed Crl.M.A.No.1960 of 2014

under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash all proceedings in

Crl.R.P.No.1853/13                     2




C.C.No.525/12 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate I,

Nedumangad, stating that the matter is settled between the

parties.        The   additional      second      respondent/    defacto

complainant has filed an affidavit stating that the matter is

settled and that she has no objection in quashing the

proceedings in C.C.No.525/12 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate I, Nedumangad.

             4.   Heard the learned counsel for the revision

petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondents.

             5. In the decision reported in Madan Mohan Abbot

v. State of Punjab [2008(3) KLT 19 (Supreme Court)] it was

held thus :

            "Criminal proceedings involving non-compoundable offences

            can be quashed by accepting the terms of compromise

            reached between the rival parties, if the question involved in

            such disputes is purely of a personal nature."

             6. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012(4) KLT 108 (Supreme Court)], it was held at

paragraph 57 as follows :

Crl.R.P.No.1853/13                    3




         "the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to

         a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320

         of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any

         Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding

         or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender

         and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the

         facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the

         High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity

         of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental

         depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot

         be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's

         family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such

         offences are not private in nature and have serious impact

         on society.        x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

                      x x x x x x x x x.       But the criminal cases

         having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

         stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing,

         particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,

         mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the

         offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or

Crl.R.P.No.1853/13                 4




         the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire

         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash

         criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility

         of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

         criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by

         not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

         settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

         the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

         contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

         criminal  proceeding   or  continuation   of  the  criminal

         proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

         despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

         wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

         appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the

         answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High

         Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the

         criminal proceeding."

Since the parties have amicably settled the dispute, I am of the

view that in order to secure the ends of justice, all further

proceedings in C.C.No.525/12 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate I, Nedumangad have to be quashed.

Crl.R.P.No.1853/13                5




             Accordingly, this Crl.R.P. is allowed. All further

proceedings in C.C.No.525/12 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate I, Nedumangad are quashed.

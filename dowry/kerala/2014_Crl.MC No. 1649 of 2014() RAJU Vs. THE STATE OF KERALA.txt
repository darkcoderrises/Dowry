    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1649 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 21st day of March, 2014.




                          O R D E R

      This is an application filed by accused Nos.1 and 2 in

Crime No.128/2014 of Kattappana Police Station to quash the

proceedings after recording the compounding entered into

between them under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.128/2014 of

Kattappana Police Station which was registered on the basis of

the statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant alleging offences under Sections 323, 324, 294

(b), 452, 506(ii) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

The matter has been settled between the parties.            The

petitioners as well as the de facto complainant were

neighbours and due to the intervention of family members of

both parties, the matter has been settled and de facto

complainant does not want to proceed with the prosecution as

against the petitioners. Since it is in the crime stage, neither

the police nor the court will drop the proceedings. No purpose

Crl.M.C.No.1649 of 2014      :  2 :

will be served by proceeding with the investigation as well in

view of the settlement. So, petitioners have no other remedy

except to approach this court seeking the following relief:

            "To    quash all further proceedings  in Crime

     No.128/2014 of Kattapana Police Station, as it is an

     abuse of process of court."

      3.     Second respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he does not want to proceed with the prosecution

and he had filed an affidavit to that effect.

      4.     The Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioners and they have no criminal antecedent

as well but opposed the application on the ground that it is in

the crime stage.        The Counsel for the petitioners also

submitted that in view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent Annexure A1 crime

was registered as Crime No.128/14 of Kattappana Police

Station against the petitioners alleging offences under Sections

323, 324, 294(b), 452 and 506(ii) read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code. Now, the matter has been settled between

Crl.M.C.No.1649 of 2014        :  3 :

the parties.     It is alleged in the petition as well as in the

Annexure A2 affidavit filed by the second respondent de facto

complainant that they are neighbours and due to the

intervention of the family members of both parties, they have

amicably settled the issues and now harmony has been

restored between them on account of the settlement and he

does not want to proceed with the case. Considering the fact

that they are neighbours and the matter has been settled, no

purpose will be served by allowing the investigation to

continue because, even the de facto complainant or the

witnesses cited by him are not going to support the

investigation officer or co-operate with the investigation.

      6.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and

Crl.M.C.No.1649 of 2014         :  4 :

      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.             Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,    partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.         In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled between the parties and it is a dispute arose between

the neighbours due to some misunderstanding which has been

Crl.M.C.No.1649 of 2014      :  5 :

solved due to the intervention of family members of both

parties and their relationship has been restored on account of

the same, this court feels that no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the investigation and no conviction will be

possible as well and it will be only a wastage of time and it is a

fit case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to

promote the harmony that has been restored between the

neighbours.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Crime No.128/2014 of Kattappana Police Station as against the

petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this

order to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kattappana

to inform the same to the concerned police station for

necessary further action in this regard.

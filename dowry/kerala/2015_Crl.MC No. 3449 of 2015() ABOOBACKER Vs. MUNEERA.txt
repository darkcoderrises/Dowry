         Dated this the 10th day of June, 2015

                           ORDER

     The petitioner is the 4th accused in Crime No.343

of 2012 of Edachery Police Station in Kozhikode

District, on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Vatakara. He is facing prosecution

for the offences punishable under Secs.498A, 406 read

with Sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code on a complaint

filed by the 1st respondent, who is the de facto

complainant, stated that she has amicably settled the

matrimonial dispute with the petitioner and now she

has no grievance against the petitioner. She does not

intend to proceed against the petitioner/4th accused

with the prosecution.        The learned counsel for the

petitioner prayed for quashing the entire prosecution

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015         -: 2 :-

proceedings against the petitioner in the above

Calender Case invoking jurisdiction and power under

Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C., in the light of the decision in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

     2. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench

of the Apex Court, on a reference, considered the

question whether the High Court has power to quash

criminal proceedings involving non-compoundable

offences on the basis of the compromise reached

between the offender and the victim and answered as

given below:

           "57. The position that emerges from

           the   above     discussion    can    be

           summarised thus: the power of the

           High Court in quashing a criminal

           proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

           exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

           distinct and different from the power

           given    to  a    criminal   court  for

           compounding      the   offences  under

           S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015         -: 3 :-

           of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in

           accord with the guideline engrafted in

           such power viz;(1) to secure the ends

           of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

           the process of any Court.        In what

           cases power to quash the criminal

           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may

           be exercised where the offender and

           victim have settled their dispute

           would depend on the facts and

           circumstances of each case and no

           category     can      be      prescribed.

           However, before exercise of such

           power, the High Court must have due

           regard to the nature and gravity of

           the crime.      Heinous and serious

           offences   of   mental      depravity or

           offences like murder, rape, dacoity,

           etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

           though the victim or victim's family

           and the offender have settled the

           dispute. Such offences are not private

           in nature and have serious impact on

           society.   Similarly, any compromise

           between the victim and offender in

           relation to the offences under special

           statutes like Prevention of Corruption

           Act or the offences committed by

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015          -: 4 :-

           public servants while working in that

           capacity etc; cannot provide for any

           basis      for    quashing      criminal

           proceedings involving such offences.

           But     the  criminal     cases  having

           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

           civil flavour stand on different footing

           for    the   purposes       of quashing,

           particularly the offences arising from

           commercial,     financial,    mercantile,

           civil,   partnership     or   such  like

           transactions or the offences arising

           out of matrimony relating to dowry,

           etc., or the family disputes where the

           wrong is basically private or personal

           in nature and the parties have

           resolved their entire dispute. In this

           category of cases, High Court may

           quash criminal proceedings if in its

           view, because of the compromise

           between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and

           bleak and continuation of criminal

           case would put accused to great

           oppression      and     prejudice   and

           extreme injustice would be caused to

           him by not quashing the criminal

           case     despite  full   and   complete

           settlement and compromise with the

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015         -: 5 :-

           victim. In other words, the High Court

           must consider whether it would be

           unfair or contrary to the interest of

           justice to continue with the criminal

           proceeding or continuation of the

           criminal       proceeding          would

           tantamount to abuse of process of

           law     despite     settlement      and

           compromise between the victim and

           wrongdoer and whether to secure the

           ends of justice, it is appropriate that

           criminal case is put to an end and if

           the answer to the above question(s)

           is in affirmative, the High Court shall

           be well within its jurisdiction to quash

           the criminal proceeding."

     3. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the

offences alleged against the petitioner will not come

under the category of non-compoundable offences,

which are specifically excluded from composition, in

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015       -: 6 :-

the exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C.  Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto

complainant, it is seen that the dispute between the

accused and the victim had been amicably settled

and, at present, the de facto complainant has no

subsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant

does not want to proceed with prosecution against the

accused.     Full and final settlement and compromise

with the victim are evidenced by Annexure-III.       In

view of the compromise between the petitioner and

the victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is

remote, bleak and continuation of the criminal case

would, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice

and also tantamount to abPuse of the process of the

court.   The present criminal prosecution against the

4th accused must be put to an end to secure the

interest of justice.

     4. In this analysis, the prosecution proceeding

against the petitioner/4th accused in Crime No.343 of

2012 of Edachery Police Station in Kozhikode District

Crl.M.C.No.3449 of 2015        -: 7 :-

is quashed.

     This petition is disposed of as above.

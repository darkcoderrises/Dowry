                   Crl.M.C.No. 1122 of 2012
                  ==================
              Dated this the 24th day of April, 2012

                             O R D E R


      This Crl.M.C is filed for quashing Annexure A Final Report

and all further proceedings in Crime No.608 of 2011 of

Pothencode police station on the file of the J.F.C.M-I, Attingal

pending as C.C. No. 1098 of 2011. This is a case involving

allegation of offences under Section 498A I.P.C read with

Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act..

      2.   The de facto complainant has filed an affidavit as

Annexure-C stating that the matter has been settled between the

parties.

      3.   Though the offence is not compoundable, in view of

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Joshi v. State of

Haryana     [2003(2)KLT       1062(SC)],   the    dispute being

essentially of a personal nature, there is no reason to proceed

with the F.I.R registered in the case.

      4.   In the above circumstances, Annexure A Final Report

shall stand quashed.

      Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

                                 sd/- A.M.SHAFFIQUE, JUDGE.

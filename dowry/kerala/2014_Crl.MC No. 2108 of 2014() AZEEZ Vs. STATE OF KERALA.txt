                   .................................................
                      Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014
                   ..................................................
              Dated this the 29th day of May, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This Criminal Miscellaneous case is filed by all the accused

in SC.No.1068/2012 pending before the third Additional

Assistant Sessions Court, Kozhikode to quash the proceedings

on the basis of a settlement under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners and the

second respondent/defacto complainant are neighbours. There

were property dispute between them. On account of the property

dispute, some incident had happened on the fateful day and the

defacto complainant sustained some injury and on the basis of

the statement given by the defacto complaint, Annexure-1 First

Information Report was           registered as Crime No.378/2012 of

Thamarasery police station originally for commission of offences

under Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 323, 324, 427 and 149 of

the Indian Penal Code           against the petitioners.              Later, after

investigation Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code was also

added and final report was filed and it was committed to the

Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014                  2

Sessions Court and it was taken on file as S.C.No.1068/2012

and was made over to the third Additional Assistant Sessions

Court, Kozhikode for disposal and that is pending before that

court.

      3. The matter has been now settled between the parties. In

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction

since some of the offences alleged are non compoundable in

nature and they cannot compound the mater before the court

below. So they have no other              remedy except to approach this

Court seeking the following relief:

                    Call for the records pertaining to Annexure A1

            (SC.1068/12 before the       3rd    Additional Assistant

            Sessions    Court,  Kozhikode)   and   quash all further

            proceedings pursuant thereto.

      4. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and the incident occurred due to some property dispute which

was later settled due to intervention of mediators and their

relationship has been restored now.                 He    does not   want to

prosecute the petitioners any longer.

      5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of

Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014          3

the settlement, there is no possibility of    conviction.    So he

prayed for allowing the application.

      6. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,        as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners,    but opposed the    application on the

ground that grave offences have been incorporated.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent as defacto complaint Annexure-1

First Information Report was registered against the petitioners

originally alleging commission of offences under Sections 143,

147, 148, 447, 323, 324, 427 and 149 of the Indian penal Code.

Later, Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code was also added and

final report was filed and now the case is pending before the

Third Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Kozhikdoe as

S.C.No.1068/2012. Now the matter has been settled between

the parties. The second respondent, the injured/defacto

complainant has filed Annexure 2 affidavit where he had stated

that there was some dispute regarding the property between

the petitioners and the second     respondent and that has been

settled due to intervention of mediators and well wishers of

both the parties. Now the relationship between the petitioners

Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014                 4

and the second respondent has been restored. Further, it is

seen from the affidavit that Section 308 has been incorporated

later. I am at this stage going into the question as to whether

the offence under Section 308 is attracted or not in view of

the fact that the mater has been settled between the parties.

Since the mater has been settled, there is no possibility of

conviction as parties will not support the case of the prosecution

and allowing the case to continue only amount to wastage of

judicial time.

        8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

            "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

            the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

            arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

            partnership or such like transactions or the offences

            arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

            family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

            personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

            entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

            may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

            of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014                  5

            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

            continuation of criminal case would put accused to

            great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

            would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

            case    despite   full and   complete    settlement  and

            compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

            Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

            contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

            criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

            proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

            law despite settlement and compromise between the

            victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

            of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

            an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

            affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

            jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the property dispute between

the parties has resulted in the incident and registration of the

crime which has been settled due to intervention of mediators

and no purpose will be served by allowing the case to continue

as conviction will be remote in such case,                  this Court feels

Crl.M.C.No.2108 of 2014               6

that this is a fit case to invoke the power under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings for promoting settlement and harmony that has

been restored between the parties on account of the settlement.


      10. So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in S.C.No.1068/12 (Crime No.378/2012 of Thamarassery police

station) pending before the Third Additional Assistant Sessions

Court, Kozhikode is hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to         communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

                CRL.M.C. No.827 of 2015
               ====================
            Dated this the 4th day of March, 2015

                         O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.436 of 2013 of the

Pavaratty Police Station, registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A and 506 of the Indian

Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-B Final Report in

Crime No.436 of 2013 of the Pavaratty Police Station and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1045 of 2013

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Chavakkad , quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

CRL.M.C.No.827 of 2015
                             -: 2 :-



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

CRL.M.C.No.827 of 2015
                                 -: 3 :-



counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-B

Final Report in Crime No.436 of 2013 of the Pavaratty

Police Station and all further proceedings based on it, in

C.C.No.1045 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Chavakkad, are hereby quashed.

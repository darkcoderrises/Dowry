          ----------------------------------------
                Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 26th day of July, 2013

                          O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.601/2013 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry which is a

case instituted upon the police report for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 r/w Section 34 of

I.P.C., with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 charge sheet and

all proceedings in C.C.No.601/2013 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolencherry, as the dispute is settled out of

Court.

        2.    The prosecution case is that, on 20/2/2013 at

12.30 p.m. petitioners herein restrained and fisted and beat

respondent No.2/CW1 and on seeing the incident when

respondent No.3/CW2 tried to obstruct the petitioner, they

beat and fisted CW2 on several parts of body and petitioner

No.1 took a stone and thrown it on the chest of respondent

No.3/CW2 and thereby the petitioners committed the aforesaid

offence. The motive alleged by the prosecution is that daughter

of  respondent    No.2/CW1    was  married    to   Anwar   S/o.

Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
                              2

Abdulkhadar, Aymanakkudy House, and a case was registered

at the instance of daughter of CW1 and when the petitioners

demanded to go out from the house, CW1 and his daughter

remained at the house and thereby committed the aforesaid

offences. Thus, according to the prosecution the petitioners

who are accused Nos.1 to 3 has committed offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 r/w Section 34 of

I.P.C. Now, the case of the petitioner is that the dispute has

been settled between the petitioners and the second

respondent, who is the defacto complainant and the 3rd

respondent who is the injured, who filed Annexures A2 and A3

affidavit respectively.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
                                3

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received          from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 341, 323, 324 r/w Section

34 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.    From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
                                    4

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
                                     5

         stand on different footing for the purposes of

         quashing, particularly the offences arising from

         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

         or such like transactions or the offences arising out

         of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

         disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved

         their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

         because of the compromise between the offender

         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

         quashing the criminal case despite          full and

         complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"

         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

Crl.M.C.No. 3114 of 2013
                                 6

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1      and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No.601/2013 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolencherry and all further proceedings

thereto.

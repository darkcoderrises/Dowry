                 -------------------------------
         Dated this the 8th day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

          The petitioner who is an accused in Crime

No.877/14 of Nedumangad Police Station seeks regular

bail as he was arrested and continuing custody from

16.7.2014 onwards.

     2. The prosecution case is that the petitioner herein

had married one Reshmi about three years back and have

been living together as husband and wife. It is alleged that

he used to harass the wife along with the second accused,

who is the brother of the first accused, both physically and

mentally in connection with demand for dowry.          It is

alleged that the physical and mental cruelty, led her to

commit suicide by hanging, on 13.7.2014 at her house.

Thus according to the prosecution, the petitioner has

committed the offences punishable under sections 304(B),

B.A.No.5892 of 2014
                              2

498A and 34 of IPC.

      3.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the dowry is not a factor which lead to the incident, by

which the deceased committed suicide, since it was a love

marriage between the deceased and the petitioner.

According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

father of the petitioner received a notice from the bank

connected with the loan availed and that is also a

circumstance opted the deceased to commit suicide. The

learned Public Prosecutor strenuously opposing the bail

application submitted that, the investigation so far

conducted shows that the deceased was subjected to

harassment demanding more dowry and she was subjected

to physical cruelty which driven out her to commit suicide.

      5. I have carefully considered the submissions made

by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

B.A.No.5892 of 2014
                              3

      6. The incident was occurred on 13.7.2014, by which

the wife of the petitioner committed suicide within 3 years

of their marriage. Therefore, according to me, this Court

will not be justified in granting bail to the petitioner, that

too within a period of 3 weeks of the occurrence of the

incident.

      In the result, I find no merit in this petition and

accordingly the same is dismissed.

                 Crl.M.C.No.2326 of 2012
         -----------------------------------------------
       Dated this the 13th day of September, 2012

                        O R D E R

        Petitioners         are      the     accused      in

C.C.No.666/11    on    the    file    of    the     Judicial

Magistrate of the First Class, Tirur. They are

being prosecuted for offences punishable under

Sections 498-A and 406 read with Section 34 of

the Indian Penal Code on a report filed by the

Sub Inspector of Police, Tirur Police Station.

Crime thereof was registered on the complaint

given by the 2nd respondent, who is the wife of

the 1st respondent, imputing of matrimonial

cruelty and harassment demanding dowry by the

petitioners. Second petitioner is the mother of

the 1st respondent. Parties have resolved the

disputes, and at present, the 2nd respondent

settling the matrimonial disputes with her

Cr.M.C.No.2326 of 2012

                        :: 2 ::



husband, is residing at the matrimonial home, is

the submission of the learned counsel for the

petitioners. First petitioner/husband is stated

to   be   employed     abroad,  and the  second

respondent resides with his mother, second

petitioner, submits the counsel.

          2. Submissions made as above are

endorsed by the learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent. An affidavit has also been

filed by the 2nd respondent asserting that she

has no grievance against the petitioners/

accused in the crime.

          3. Learned Public Prosecutor has been

directed to ascertain through the investigating

officer the veracity of the assertion jointly

made by the parties as to resolving of the

disputes and living together of the spouses.

Public Prosecutor, after getting instructions,

Cr.M.C.No.2326 of 2012

                        :: 3 ::



submits that the spouses are presently living

together.

          4.  In    such  circumstances,  I  find,

continuation      of  the    criminal proceedings

against the husband and his mother at the

instance of the 2nd respondent/wife, if allowed

to proceed, would only rupture their renewed

marital    relationship     between  the  spouses.

Having regard to the nature of the case which

has arisen from matrimonial disputes, it could

be stated that offences are only personal and

not affecting the public at large. Further more,

in   view   of    the  settlement,   even  if the

prosecution      is   continued,   chances  of  a

successful prosecution leading to conviction of

the accused persons are rather remote.

          5.  Taking    into   account  all  these

circumstances,       the    criminal  proceedings

Cr.M.C.No.2326 of 2012

                         :: 4 ::



against the petitioners/accused in C.C.No.666/11

on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the

First Class, Tirur are quashed under Section 482

of the Code.

          Crl.M.C is disposed of.

                O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368 of 2013
        -------------------------------------------------------
        DATED THIS THE 25th DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2015

                             JUDGMENT

ANIL K.NARENDRAN, J.

      The petitioner in O.P. (KAT) No.80 of 2013 is the 2nd applicant

in T.A.No.2293/2012 on the file of the Kerala Administrative

Tribunal, Thiruvananthapuram, and the petitioner in O.P. (KAT)

No.1368 of 2013 is the 1st applicant in that T.A.

      2.   The petitioners entered service as Probation Officers

Grade II in the Department of Social Welfare on 5/4/1995 and

20/3/1995 respectively. They were promoted as Child Development

Project Officers on 16/7/1998 and 7/6/1999 respectively. They

were further promoted as District Probation Officers Grade I on

6/4/2000 and 12/4/2004 respectively and are continuing in that

post.

      3.   The petitioners had approached this Court in W.P.(C)

No.20358 of 2010, seeking a declaration that the provisions of the

Special Rules for the Kerala Social Welfare State Service, 2010,

relating to categories 4, 5 and 6 to the extent they are at variance

with the provisions of the Special Rules for the Kerala Social

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13    -2-




Welfare State Service, 1992, and against the provisions of the

Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and the Kerala Probation of

Offenders Rules, 1960, are unconstitutional and void and hence

unenforceable.      They  also  sought   a   writ  of   mandamus

commanding the respondents not to enforce the provisions of the

Special Rules for the Kerala Social Welfare State Service, 2010,

relating to categories 4, 5 and 6 to the extent they are at

variance with the provisions of the Special Rules for the Kerala

Social Welfare State Service, 1992, and against the provisions of

the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and the Kerala Probation of

Offenders Rules, 1960.

      4.    On the formation of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal

at Thiruvananthapuram, the above Writ Petition was transferred

to the Tribunal and was re-numbered as T.A.No.2293 of 2012.

The Tribunal by order dated 28/11/2012, dismissed T.A.No.2293

of 2012 holding that the provisions of the Special Rules for the

Kerala Social Welfare State Service, 2010 cannot be described as

manifestly unjust, arbitrary or unequal in its operation warranting

condemnation of the same as beyond the rule making power of

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -3-




the State Government. It is aggreived by the said order passed

by the Tribunal, the petitioners are before us in these O.P.(KAT)s.

      5.    We heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner in O.P.(KAT)No.80/2013, the learned

counsel for the petitioner in O.P.(KAT)No.1368/2013 and also the

learned Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.

      6.    As per the Special Rules for the Kerala Social Welfare

State Service, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the Special Rules

of 1992), the Kerala Social Welfare Service consisted of nine

categories of posts. Category No.4 was Regional Probation

Officer/Regional Assistant Director/Assistant Director of Social

Welfare. Category No.5 was District Social Welfare Officer/

Inspector, Special Nutrition Programme Grade I. Category No.6

was District Probation Officer Grade I. Category No.7 was Child

Development Project Officer, Integrated Child Development

Services Scheme/Program Officer/Project Officer, Upgraded

Special Nutrition Programme.

      7.    Going by the Special Rules of 1992, the method of

appointment with effect from 16/9/1985 to the category of

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13    -4-




Regional Probation Officers/Regional Assistant Director/Assistant

Director of Social Welfare is by promotion from categories 5 and

6 only and in the absence of qualified candidates for promotion,

by direct recruitment. Therefore, the petitioners who are District

Probation Officers Grade I could have aspired for promotion to

the category of Regional Probation Officer/Regional Assistant

Director/Assistant Director of Social Welfare, based on their

ranking in the common list of categories 5 and 6 prepared on the

basis of the date of appointment to the respective categories,

according to seniority.

      8.    While so, the Government of Kerala, in supersession of

the Special Rules of 1992, has issued the Special Rules for the

Kerala Social Welfare State Service, 2010 (hereinafter referred to

as the Special Rules of 2010). The Special Rules of 2010 also

consist of nine categories of posts. But in the said Special Rules

category     No.4    is  Regional Assistant  Director  of   Social

Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare. Category No.5 is

District Social Welfare Officer and category No.6 is Probation

Officer Grade I. As per the Special Rules of 2010, category No.5

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -5-




District Social Welfare Officer is the promotion post of category

No.6 Probation Officer Grade I and also category Nos. 7, 8 and 9.

The post of Social Welfare Officer can also be filled up by

appointment by transfer from Senior Superintendents in the

Social Welfare Department. Going by Note (i) under category

No.5, a ratio of 1:10:3 shall be maintained between (i) category

No.6, (ii) category No.7 and (iii) category Nos.8 & 9 and Senior

Superintendent and equated posts in the Social Welfare

Department for promotion/transfer appointment to the post of

District Social Welfare Officer, from among qualified persons in

those categories.

      9.    The petitioners would contend that, the provisions

contained in the Special Rules of 2010, prescribing method of

appointment to category No.4 Regional Assistant Director of

Social Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare and to

category No.6 Probation Officer Grade I are against the

provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Act') and also the rules made thereunder.

      10. As per Section 2(b) of the Act, 'Probation Officer'

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -6-




means an officer appointed to be a probation officer or

recognised as such under Section 13 of the said Act. Going by

Sub-section (1) of Section 13, a probation officer under the said

Act shall be a person appointed to be a Probation Officer by the

State Government or recognised as such by the State

Government; or a person provided for this purpose by a society

recognised in this behalf by the State Government; or in any

exceptional case, any other person who in the opinion of the

Court, is fit to act as a Probation Officer in the special

circumstances of the case. As per Sub-section (2) of Section 13

of the Act, a Court which passes an order under Section 4 or the

District Magistrate of the district in which the offender for the

time being resides may, at any time, appoint any Probation

Officer in the place of the person named in the supervision order.

Sub-section (3) of Section 13 of the Act states that, a Probation

Officer, in the exercise of his duties under the said Act, shall be

subject to the control of the District Magistrate of the district, in

which the offender resides for the time being.

      11. Section 14 of the Act deals with the duties of Probation

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -7-




Officer. As per Section 14 of the Act, a Probation Officer shall,

subject to such conditions and restrictions, as may be prescribed,

inquire, in accordance with any directions of a Court, into the

circumstances or home surroundings of any person accused of an

offence with a view to assist the Court in determining the most

suitable method of dealing with him and submit reports to the

Court; supervise probationers and other persons placed under his

supervision and, where necessary, endeavor to find them suitable

employment; advise and assist offenders in the payment of

compensation or costs ordered by the Court; advise and assist, in

such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed, persons

who have been released under Section 4; and perform such other

duties as may be prescribed.

      12. As per Section 17 of the Act, the Government may,

with the approval of the Central Government, by notification in

the Official Gazette, make rules to carry out the purposes of the

Act, and going by Sub-section (2) such rules may provide for

appointment of Probation Officers, the terms and conditions of

their service and the area within which they are to exercise

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -8-




jurisdiction; duties of Probation Officers under the Act and the

submission of reports by them; etc. In exercise of that power,

the Government of Kerala has issued the Kerala Probation of

Offenders Rules, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules').

Going by Clause (c) to Rule 1 of the Rules, 'District Probation

Officer' means the salaried Probation Officer in charge of the

work of probation in the whole district or in a part of a district, as

per jurisdiction prescribed from time to time. 'Regional Probation

Officer' means an officer appointed by the State Government to

control, guide and supervise the work of Probation Officers

(salaried and honorary) within his jurisdiction. Rule 3 of the Rules

deals with appointment of Chief Probation Superintendent and

the duties and functions attached to that post. Going by Rule 3,

the   State    Government    shall  appoint   a   Chief   Probation

Superintendent and subject to the control and supervision of the

Inspector-General, the Chief Probation Superintendent shall

administer the work of probation throughout the State and shall

direct, supervise and shall be responsible for the proper

performance of the work of probation. Similarly, the Rules

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -9-




contemplate appointment of Regional Probation Officer for the

effective implementation of the Probation System throughout the

State. Rule 6 of the Rules deals with Probation Officers. As per

Sub-rule (1) of Rule 6, the State Government shall appoint as

many Probation Officers (salaried and honorary) in each district

as may be deemed necessary. Going by Sub-rule (2) the

headquarters of a District Probation Officer shall ordinarily be the

headquarters of the district. The qualifications and method of

appointment for the post of the Probation Officer and other

higher posts are prescribed in the Rules. Similarly, the powers

and duties of such officers are also prescribed in the Rules, which

make it abundantly clear that these officers are appointed for the

effective implementation of the Probation System throughout the

State, and they discharge their powers and duties under the

overall supervision of the Inspector-General.

      13. The tenor of the contentions raised in counter affidavit

filed by the 1st respondent in W.P.(C)No.20385/2010 is that, the

provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act and the Kerala

Probation of Offenders Rules are being implemented in the State

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -10-




mainly through the Jails Department, which comes under the

Home Department. Since the Social Welfare Department is not

the sole agency for the implementation of Probation System in

the State, all the posts contemplated under the Probation of

Offenders Act are not provided in the Social Welfare Department

and the only posts available are that of Probation Officer Grade I

under the Kerala Social Welfare State Service and Probation

Officer Grade I under the Kerala Social Welfare Subordinate

Service.

      14. The Probation of Offenders Act was enacted to provide

for release of offenders on probation or after due admonition and

for matter connected therewith. As we have already noticed, the

post of Probation Officer and other higher posts created under

the said Act and the Kerala Probation of Offenders Rules are for

the effective implementation of the Probation System throughout

the State. The powers and duties of such officers are prescribed

in the Rules, so also the qualifications and method of

appointment for these posts. The petitioners have no case that,

the Social Welfare Department is the only agency for the

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -11-




implementation of Probation System in the State. When the

provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act and the Kerala

Probation of Offenders Rules are being implemented in the State

mainly through the Jails Department, which comes under the

Home Department, the petitioners cannot insist that, all the posts

contemplated under the Probation of Offenders Act should be

provided in the Social Welfare Department itself. Merely for the

reason that, at the time of formation of the Social Welfare

Department certain posts of Probation Officers were shifted to

that Department by Exhibit P4 Government order dated

9/9/1975, the petitioners cannot insist that the Government

should retain such posts in that Department itself. The rule

making authority in its wisdom has thought it unnecessary to

have all such posts within the Special Rules for the Kerala Social

Welfare State Service. Such an action of the rule making

authority will not in any manner contravene the provisions of the

Probation of Offenders Act or the Kerala Probation of Offenders

Rules. It will also not amount to amending the provisions of the

Kerala Probation of Offenders Rules. Therefore, the contention of

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13     -12-




the petitioners, mainly relying on Sub-section (1) of Section 17 of

the Act is absolutely untenable and can only be rejected.

      15. We also notice that, the Special Rules for the Kerala

Social Welfare State Service are framed under Sub-section (1) of

Section 2 of the Kerala Public Services Act, 1968. The said Act

was enacted by the State Legislature in exercise of its powers

conferred under Article 309 of the Constitution of India, read with

Entry 41 of list II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution,

which authorises the State Government to frame service

conditions of the employees serving under it. Going by Sub-

section (1) of Section 2 of the Act, the Government may make

rules either prospectively or retrospectively to regulate the

recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed, to

public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the

State. Section 4 of the said Act contains a non-obstante clause,

which reads thus;

      "4. Act and Rules thereunder to apply to certain persons

      notwithstanding anything in the Industrial Disputes Act or any

      other law:- Notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter V-A

      or in any other provision of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13       -13-




      (Central Act 14 of 1947) or in any other law for the time being

      in force, or in any judgment, decree or order of any court, the

      appointment of any person to any public service or post in

      connection with the affairs of the State of Kerala and the

      conditions of service (including termination of service) of any

      person appointed to any such service or post shall be governed

      by the provisions of this Act and the Rules made or deemed to

      have been made thereunder."

      16. Therefore, Section 4 of the Kerala Public Services Act,

1968, makes it expressly clear that the provisions of the Rules

framed under the said Act will prevail over the provisions of any

other law for the time being in force. Section 4 was incorporated

in the Kerala Public Services Act by the Amendment Act 4 of

1984, with effect from 1/10/1981. The said Amendment Act

received the assent of the President on 5/1/1984 and was

notified in the Official Gazette on 7/1/1984. The Probation of

Offenders Act,1958 is enacted by the Central Government under

Entry 2 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. In

such circumstances, Section 4 of the Kerala Public Services Act,

1968 will override the provisions of the Probation of Offenders

Act, 1958. If that be so, the Special Rules for the Kerala Social

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -14-




Welfare State Service framed under Sub-section (1) of Section 2

of the Kerala Public Services Act, 1968 will prevail over the Rules

framed under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, by virtue of

Clause (2) of Article 254 of the Constitution of India. Further, the

Probation of Offenders Act is a special legislation concerning

release of offenders on probation and the said Act is a general

legislation concerning the framing of Rules in relation to the

service conditions of Probation Officers and others appointed for

the effective implementation of the Probation System throughout

the State. In that view of the matter as well, the provisions of the

Kerala Probation of Offenders Rules, 1960 will have to yield to

the provisions of the Special Rules for the Kerala Social Welfare

State Service framed under Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the

Kerala Public Services Act, 1968. Therefore, we find that the

Tribunal has rightly repelled the attempt made by the petitioners

to impugn the Special Rules of 2010, relying on the provisions of

the Probation of Offenders Act and the Kerala Probation of

Offenders Rules.

      17. The petitioners would further contend that, going by

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -15-




the Special Rules of 2010, a District Probation Officer can get

promotion to category No.4 Regional Assistant Director of Social

Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare only after getting

promotion as District Social Welfare Officer. Further, because of

the ratio prescribed in the said Special Rules, only when 14

vacancies are there one Probation Officer Grade I can get

promotion to the category of District Social Welfare Officer.

Therefore, the possibility of a Probation Officer Grade I getting

promoted to category No.4 is remote. According to the

petitioners, the Special Rules of 1992 was replaced by the Special

Rules of 2010 for the purpose of rectifying certain anomaly. The

District Social Welfare Officers had a grievance that, the District

Probation Officers Grade I were stealing a march over them in

the matter of promotion to the category of Regional Assistant

Director of Social Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare.

But, to redress their grievance it was sufficient to introduce a

ratio between District Social Welfare Officers and the District

Probation Officers in the matter of promotion. Since the strength

of District Social Welfare Officers is 14 and that of the Probation

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -16-




Officers Grade I is 17, the prescription of a ratio of 1:1 between

these categories would have been sufficient to redress the

grievance of the District Social Welfare Officers.

      18. The respondents would contend that the Special Rules

of 2010 was brought out in order to rectify certain major

anomalies in the Special Rules of 1992. As per the Special Rules

of 1992, category No.5 District Social Welfare Officer/Inspector

Special Nutrition Programme Grade I and category No.6 District

Probation Officer Grade I were the feeder category for promotion

to category No.4 Regional Probation Officer/Regional Assistant

Director/Assistant Director of Social Welfare. As per Note (vi) to

Rule 28(b)(i)(7) of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service

Rules, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as 'the KS&SSR'), when

there are more than one feeder category carrying different scales

of pay, they shall be shown in separate lists and persons in a

lower scale of pay shall be appointed only after appointing all

persons on a higher scale of pay, unless the Special Rules

prescribe a ratio or any special order of preference for each

feeder category. Further, going by Note (vii) to Rule 28(b)(i)(7)

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13     -17-




of the KS&SSR, when the posts in the feeder categories are on

the same scale of pay and there is no fixed ratio, appointment

shall be made in accordance with their seniority in the feeder

category, the seniority being determined by the date of the order

of first appointment to that particular category, class or grade.

      19. Now, as per the Special Rules of 2010, the feeder

category for category No.4 Regional Assistant Director of Social

Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare is Category No.5

District Social Welfare Officer. The feeder category for category

No.5 District Social Welfare Officer is category Nos.6 Probation

Officer   Grade     I,  category  No.7    Programme    Officer/Child

Development Project Officer (ICDS Scheme), category No.8

Superintendent         Welfare    Institution   Grade      I/Deputy

Superintndent-cum-Headmaster Grade I/Deputy Superintendent

Grade I/Regional Dowry Prohibition Officer, and Category No.9

Superintendent, Home for Mentally Deficient Children/Prathyasha

Bhavan (Home for Mentally Deficient Adults). Therefore, as per

the Special Rules of 2010, a District Probation Officer Grade I can

aspire promotion to the post of Regional Assistant Director of

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13    -18-




Social Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare only after

getting promotion to category No.5 District Social Welfare Officer.

It is pertinent to note that, even under the Special Rules of 1992,

category No.4 Regional Probation Officer/Regional Assistant

Director of Social Welfare/Assistant Director of Social Welfare was

not exclusively reserved for category No.6 District Probation

Officer Grade I and District Probation Officer Grade I was only

one among the feeder categories to category No.4.

      20. The respondents would further contend that, the ratio

of 1:10:3 prescribed in the Special Rules of 2010 for category

No.5 District Social Welfare Officer is according to the sanctioned

cadre strength of the feeder categories. Going by the counter

affidavit filed on behalf of the 1st respondent, the sanctioned

cadre strength of category No.5 District Social Welfare Officer is

14, category No.6 District Social Welfare Officer is 17, category

No.7 Programme Officer/Child Development Project Officer (ICDS

Scheme) is 179 and category No.8 Superintendent Welfare

Institution Grade I/Superintendent (Juvenile Justice) Grade I/etc.

is 5. Therefore, we find considerable force in the contention

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -19-




raised on behalf of the respondents that, it was taking into

consideration the sanctioned cadre strength of each category, the

ratio between (i) category No.6, (ii) category No.7, and (iii)

category Nos.8 and 9 has been fixed as 1:10:3 in the Special

Rules of 2010 for promotion/transfer appointment to category

No.5 District Social Welfare Officer, in order to ensure equal

opportunity to all feeder categories. In such circumstances, the

contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner in O.P.

(KAT)No.1386/2013, relying on the judgments of the Apex Court

in S.Ramesha v. State of Karnataka (1995 (Supp.3) SCC

260) and Ashutosh Gupta v. State of Rajasthan (2002 (4)

SCC 34) that, there is no rationale or reasonableness for

introduction of the Special Rules of 2010 is absolutely untenable

and it can only be rejected.

      21. In Indravadan H.Shah v. State of Gujarat (1986

(Supp.) SCC 254) relied on by the learned counsel for the

petitioner in O.P.(KAT)No.1386/2013, the Apex Court was dealing

with the amendment made to Rule 6(4)(i) and Rule 6(4)(iii)(a) of

the Gujarat Judicial Service Recruitment Rules, 1961, which

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13    -20-




provided that a Civil Judge (Senior Division) after completing 48

years of age will not be eligible for consideration for promotion to

the post of Assistant Judge. Though the post of Assistant Judge

as well as the post of District Judge belong to the senior branch

of Gujarat Judicial Service, yet in the higher cadre of District

Judge no such age bar has been introduced. The Apex Court held

that, there is obviously no rationale, nor any reasonableness for

introduction of such an age bar and the rule is therefore,

arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of

India. Therefore, the aforesaid judgment of the Apex Court

stands on a different factual matrix altogether.

      22. As rightly noticed by the Tribunal, the Government

have decided to frame new rules taking into account the views of

various sections, as there was widespread complaints that the

Probation     Officers   were   getting  accelerated    promotions.

Therefore, the Government have decided to apportion the posts

in the higher cadre with reference to the cadre strength of the

respective groups in the feeder category and an equitable

distribution of the available posts was also made in the Special

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -21-




Rules of 2010. The mere reason that the petitioners have lost

some advantages which they were enjoying earlier under the

Special Rules of 1992 is not a valid ground to impugn the Special

Rules of 2010 as violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India. In Pankajashy v. George Mathew (1987

(2) KLT 723) a Division Bench of this Court has held that, the

rule made under a statute by an authority delegated for the

purpose can be challenged on the ground that it is ultra vires of

the Act; it is opposed to the fundamental rights; and it is

opposed to other plenary laws. To ascertain whether a rule is

ultra vires of the Act, the Court can go into the question whether

it contravenes expressly or impliedly any of the provisions of the

statute; whether it achieves the intent and object of the Act; and

whether it is 'unreasonable' to be manifestly arbitrary, unjust or

partial implying thereby want of authority to make such rules. In

Exhibit P3 order dated 28/11/2012 in T.A.No.2293/2012, the

Tribunal came to the conclusion that, none of the grounds

enumerated in Pankajakshy's case (supra) is available for

attacking the Special Rules of 2010.

O.P.(KAT)Nos.80 & 1368/13   -22-




      23. As rightly held by the Tribunal, the provisions of the

Special Rules of 2010 cannot be described as manifestly unjust,

arbitrary or unequal in its operation warranting condemnation of

the same as beyond the Rule making power of the State

Government.

      For the reasons stated above, we find absolutely no grounds

to interfere with the conclusions made by the Tribunal in the

impugned order. In the result, these O.P.(KAT)s fail and they are

dismissed.

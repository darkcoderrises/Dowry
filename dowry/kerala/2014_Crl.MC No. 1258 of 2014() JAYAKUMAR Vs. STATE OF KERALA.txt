                    .................................................
                       Crl.M.C.No.1258 of 2014
                    ..................................................
             Dated this the 21st day of February, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the sole

accused in C.C.2339/12 (Crime No.240/12 of Ernakulam                       Central

police station) to quash the proceedings recording the composition

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

referred to as the Code).

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the sole

accused in Crime No.240/2012 of Ernakulam Central Police Station

which is now pending as C.C.2339/12 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate-II, Ernakulam. The case was registered on the basis

of the statement     given by the            third       respondent     as defacto

complainant alleging the offences under Section 341, 294 (b) and

Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code. The allegation was that on

22.1.2012 at about 9.30 a.m due to dispute between the petitioner

and the defacto complainant regarding                  cricket-play, the petitioner

wrongfully restrained the defacto complainant and his autorickshaw

near to Ernakulam KSRTC boat jetty and abused him in filthy

language and fisted him, using unknown weapons, caused injury to

him and thereby he had committed the above said offences.                      The

Crl.M.C.No.1258 of 2014             2

matter has been settled between the parties.               The defacto

complainant has no interest in prosecuting the case as it was settled

due to intervention of mediators and friends. The freindship has

been restored on      account of the settlement.    Since some of the

offences are non compoundable in nature, they cannot approach

the court below for compounding the case. So the petitioner has no

other remedy except to approch this Court for this purpose. Hence

the petitioner has filed this petition seeking the following reliefs:




       In these circumstances it is most respectfully prayed
       that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash all
       further proceedings against the petitioner/accused in
       Annexure A2 final report in Crime No.240/2012 of
       Ernakulam Central Police Station now pending before
       the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam
       as C.C.No.2339/2012 as it is an abuse of process of
       court.


      3. The counsel for the third respondent appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and he has no grievance against the petiotioner now and

their friendship has been restored on account of the settlement. He

has no objection in quashing the proceedings. The learned counsel

for the defacto complainant submitted that the defacto complainant

filed an affidavit to that effect as Annexure A3.

      4. On instructions, as directed by this Court, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.1258 of 2014             3

Prosecutor     submitted that excpet this case, there is no other case

against the petitioner and he has no other criminal background and

the   incident itself has happened     due to some misunderstanding

between the petitioner and the defacto complaint and opposed the

quashing of the prceedings at this stage.

      5. The counsel for the petitioner      submitted that since the

matter has been settled between the parties, there is possibility of

conviction being entered into and it will only     wastage of    judicial

time to allow the case to continue in the lower court.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement given

by the third respondent, Ernakulam Central police has registered a

case as Crime No.240/2012 against the petitioner as Annexrue A1

alleging offences under Sections 341, 294(b) and 324 of the Indian

Penal Code and after investigation Anenxure A2 final report was

filed   before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam

where it is now pending as C.CNo. 2339/12. The matter has been

settled between the decfacto complanant and the petitioner, who is

the sole accused in the case and the defacto complainant had filed

Annexure-A3 affidavit before this Court admitting the settlement and

expressing his willingness to     quash all    proceedings.    It is also

mentioned in the affidavit that both are auto rickshaw drivers and

due to some misunderstanding, the case has been filed. Now they

Crl.M.C.No.1258 of 2014                  4

have settled the mater and restored friendship between them on

account of the settlement         which resulted        due to intervention of

mediators and friends

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

            "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
            the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
            arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
            partnership or such like transactions or the offences
            arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
            family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
            personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
            entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
            quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
            compromise between the offender and victim, the
            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
            continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
            oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
            be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case
            despite full and complete settlement and compromise
            with the victim. In other words, the High Court must
            consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
            interest of justice to continue with the criminal
            proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings
            would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
            settlement and compromise between the victim and
            wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it
            is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
            the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the
            High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash
            the criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also  considering the fact that the petitioner              and     the defacto

complainant were friends and due to some misunderstanding, the

Crl.M.C.No.1258 of 2014                5

incident happened and now they settled their dispute and restored

their friendship, this Court feels that no puupose will be served by

allowing the case to continue and it will be only a wastage of judicial

time to allow the same as there is no possibility of conviction, if the

case is allowed to be tried by examining the witnesses. So this

court feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of

the Code     has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote

setllement between the parties. So the petition is allowed and further

poceedings in C.CNo.2339/12 (Crime No.240/12 of                Ernakulam

Central Police Station) pending before the            JFCM-II, Ernakulam

against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communciate this order to the concerned

court for necessary further action.

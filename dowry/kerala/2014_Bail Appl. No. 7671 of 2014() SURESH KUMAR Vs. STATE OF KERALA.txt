                     B.A.NO.7671 of 2014 (D)
                   ---------------------------------------
              Dated this the 29th day of October, 2014


                              ORDER

       The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.831 of

2014 of Nooranadu Police Station, Alappuzha District registered

initially for offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 506

(II), 294(b), 377, 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

       2.    It is now brought to notice that latter after

investigation offence under sections 324, 506(II), 377 read with

Section 34 of IPC have been deleted according to the

necessary proceedings in that regard and initially though there

are two accused. Accused No.2 (mother of the petitioner) has

also been deleted from the accused array. So as at present, the

offences alleged in instant Crime No.831 of 2014 are those

under Section 323, 294(b), 498A of the IPC and the petitioner is

the sole accused therein. The only non-bailable offence now

subsisting is one under Section 498A of the IPC.

       3.    The gist of the allegation is that, the petitioner and

the de facto complainant were married as per the religious rites

and customs and a son was born in the wedlock.                  After

marriage the de facto complainant resided at the petitioners

B.A.NO.7671 of 2014 (D)
                                  2

residence and that 33 sovereigns of gold ornaments was given

to her at the time of marriage and that the petitioner made the

de facto complainant to believe that he is a building contractor

who owns 22 cents of land and a building having 1500 sq.ft.

Thereafter, the petitioner started ill treating her physically and

mentally demanding for more dowry and misappropriated her

gold ornaments and 20 cents of the property. Petitioner had

sent abusive messages to the sister of the de facto

complainant and when she questioned it on 25.03.2014, the

petitioner assaulted the de facto complainant on her face and

threatened her using a swordstick and thereby committed the

offences.

      4.    Sri.K.Shaj the learned counsel for the petitioner

submits that the petitioner is innocent of the allegations and

that the petitioner has been falsely implicated only due to the

difference of opinion of matrimonial relationship with his wife

and that the alleged incident was on 25.03.2014 but the

complaint laid only on 25.06.2014, which shows that the

allegations are the product of an afterthought. Petitioner prays

that the plea of pre-arrest is allowed, he would comply with any

stringent conditions that may be imposed by this Court so as to

protect the bonafide interest of the prosecution.

B.A.NO.7671 of 2014 (D)
                                 3

      4.    The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that 2nd

accused and other offences stated above have also been

deleted and the subsisting offences of the instant crime are

those under Sections 323, 294(b) and 498A and that the only

non-bailable offence alleged against the       petitioner is only

under Section 498A. The public prosecutor further submits that

in case, this Court is inclined to allow the pre-arrest bail, but

with sufficient safeguards and conditions to protect the

bonafide interest of the prosecution.

      5.    Having heard the submissions of the learned counsel

for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor and on

evaluation of the totality of the facts and circumstances of the

case, this Court is inclined to hold that discretion can be

exercised to grant pre-arrest bail in this case but with sufficient

safeguards and conditions.

      6.    Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of the

arrest of the petitioner herein in connection with the above said

crime, he shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for

`35,000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand only) with two solvent

sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the

investigating officer in the above crime and subject to the

following conditions:

B.A.NO.7671 of 2014 (D)
                                        4

(i)      The petitioner shall surrender his passport, if any, before the
         jurisdictional Magistrate concerned within 3 days from the
         execution of the bail bond before the Investigating Officer and if
         he is not holder of passport, then he shall file an affidavit to that
         effect in the said court. If the petitioner requires his passport in
         connection with his travel abroad, then he is free to approach
         the court below concerned for the release of the same and for
         necessary permission in that regard. In case such an application
         is filed, the trial court or the jurisdictional Magistrate concerned,
         as the case may be, is free to consider the same on merits and
         to pass appropriate orders thereon, taking necessary guidance
         from the principles laid down in the decision of this Court in the
         case Asok Kumar v. State of Kerala, reported in 2009 (2) KLT
         712, notwithstanding the aforementioned conditions imposed by
         this Court.

(ii)     The petitioner shall not involve in any criminal offence of similar
         nature or graver in nature.

(iii)    The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation and report
         before the investigating officer as and when required.

(iv)     The petitioner shall not influence the witnesses or shall not
         tamper or attempt to tamper evidence in any manner
         whatsoever.


       If the petitioner violates any of the conditions as ordered

above, then the bail granted to him is liable to be cancelled.

      With the above said directions, this Bail Application

stands finally disposed of.

                     Crl.M.C.No. 2291 of 2013
                  ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 10th day of June, 2013

                               O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.No.753 of 2010      of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 382 of 2010 of

Tirur Police Station for the offence punishable under Section 498A

read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings against the accused in C.C.No.753 of 2010 before the

JFCM Court, Tirur as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that the marriage

between the first petitioner and the respondent was solemnized on

12.3.2010 and at the time of marriage, the first petitioner was given

with 30 sovereigns of gold ornaments out of the 50 sovereigns

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                  :-2-:

assured to be given.       On 20.3.2010 evening, the first petitioner

misbehaved to the respondent complaining about the shortage in gold

given and beauty of the respondent etc. and assaulted the respondent

and the same was repeated on 21.3.2010 and on 3.4.2010 also. Then

on intimating to the parents of the respondent, the parents came and

the respondent was taken to her paternal home.           Thereafter, on

mediation and on giving the balance 20 sovereigns of gold, the

respondent was again taken along with first petitioner on 8.4.2010 and

thereafter the first petitioner left for abroad on 16.4.2010. Then the

fourth petitioner/fourth accused returned to India from abroad on

29.4.2010 and approached the respondent with demand to give her

gold ornaments and while declining the demand, the fourth petitioner

forcefully took away the gold from the custody of the respondent and

the fourth petitioner also assaulted the respondent. The petitioners 2

and 3 herein who are accused 2 and 3 in the above case also

misbehaved and mentally caused pain to the respondent and hence the

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                 :-3-:

complaint was filed and now, the case of the petitioner/s is that the

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and she has no

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                  :-4-:

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case is

Section 498A read with Section 34 of I.P.C.which is more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offence is involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the first respondent, it

appears to me that the the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/ accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them.       In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the

Honourable Apex Court,          in the decision reported in Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                             :-5-:

[2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

         considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

         also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

         home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.


                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                            :-6-:

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in

         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort

         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their

         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                            :-7-:

         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power

         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A

of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated

from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the

parties want a quietus to the criminal case as well.

         8.      According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision will be squarely applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of

the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

Crl.M.C.No.2291 of 2013
                                  :-8-:

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decision cited

supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

proceedings pending against the petitioners/accused in C.C.No.753 of

2010 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur.

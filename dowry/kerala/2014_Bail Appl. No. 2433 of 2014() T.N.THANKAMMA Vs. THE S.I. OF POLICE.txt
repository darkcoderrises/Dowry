of the first accused.

     2.    It is alleged that the accused subjected the de-

facto complainant to physical and mental cruelty demanding

more amount/dowry. It is further contended that with the

sale proceeds of the gold ornaments of the complainant,

punishable under Sec.420 of IPC. Petitioner herein is the

           correctness of the tax receipts produced by the

           sureties, the learned Magistrate can insist for

                Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
      Dated this the 11th day of September, 2013.


                         O R D E R


        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the de facto complainant

in Crime No.586/11 of Nadapuram police station and the

2nd respondent is the accused in the above crime.        On

completing the investigation in the above crime, the police

has   already   filed   a    report,     based   upon which

C.C.No.989/11 was instituted in the court of Judicial First

Class Magistrate-Nadapuram, on taking cognizance for the

offences punishable under Section 294(b), 406 and 498 A

of IPC. The allegation raised by the de facto complainant

against the accused is that the 2nd respondent/2nd accused

married her on 25.5.2009 as per the customary rites

prevailing among Hindu religion and while the petitioner/

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                               2

de facto complainant was residing in her matrimonial

home, the accused misappropriated the gold ornaments of

the de facto complainant and physically harassed her and

thereby the accused committed the offences punishable

under section 294(b), 406 and 498 A of IPC. Now the case

of the petitioner who is the de facto complainant is that

after the initiation of the criminal proceedings against the

accused, the entire dispute is settled amicably through the

negotiation between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent.

Annexure-3 is the application for compromise of settlement

which is signed by both the petitioner/de facto complainant

and the 2nd respondent/accused and counter signed by

respective counsel.

         2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

         3.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the petitioner/de facto complainant do not want to

proceed any further against the accused/2nd respondent, as

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                               3

the matter is settled out of court. It is also the submission

of the learned counsel for the petitioner that as per the

settlement arrived, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to

move this Court to withdraw or to co-operate with the

proceedings for quashing Crime No.586/2011 and the de

facto complainant has also received the disputed gold

ornaments from the 2nd respondent as per the local

mediation on 22.2.2010. Learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent has also submitted that as the matter

has been settled, the proceedings now pending against him

has to be dropped. As I am satisfied with the settlement

arrived, particularly in view of Annexure-3 and in the light

of the submission made by the learned counsel for the

petitioner as well as the 2nd respondent, according to me, it

is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement and to

drop the proceedings, following the guidelines issued by

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                                 4

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power    given  to  a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute
         would depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........   But   the   criminal   cases     having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,         financial,mercandile,       civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                                  5

         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite        full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"

Further, in        Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case,        the Apex

Court has held as follows:-

                 "7.   It is not in dispute that matrimonial
           disputes have been on considerable increase in
           recent times resulting in filing of complaints
           under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only
           against the husband but also against the relatives
           of the husband.      The question is when such
           matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing
           to rejoin the matrimonial home or by mutual
           settlement of other pending disputes for which
           both the sides approached the High Court and
           jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal
           proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife
           under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether
           the prayer can be declined on the sole ground
           that since the offences are non-compoundable
           under Section 320 of the Code, it would be
           impermissible for the court to quash the criminal
           proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                 8. It is not in dispute that in the case on
           hand subsequent to the filing of the criminal
           complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC
           and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition
           Act, 1961, with the help and intervention of
           family members, friends and well-wishers, the
           parties concerned have amicably settled their
           differences         and         executed        a
           compromise/settlement.      Pursuant thereto, the

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                                  6

           appellants filed the said compromise before the
           Trial Court with a request to place the same on
           record and to drop the criminal proceedings
           against the appellants herein. It is also not in
           dispute     that in   additional   to  the    mutual
           settlement arrived at by the parties, respondent/-
           wife has also filed an affidavit stating that she did
           not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings
           against the appellants and fully supported the
           contents of the settlement deed.          It is the
           grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial
           Court rejected such prayer of the parties but also
           the High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction
           under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground
           that the criminal proceedings relate to the
           offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406
           of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."
                 "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts
           to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial
           disputes, particularly, when the same are on
           considerable increase. Even if the offences are
           non-compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial
           disputes and the Court is satisfied that the parties
           have settled the same amicably and without any
           pressure, we hold that for the purpose of
           securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code
           would not be a bar to the exercise of power of
           quashing of FIR, complaint or the subsequent
           criminal proceedings.

           13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
           disputes in recent times.        The institution of
           marriage occupies an important place and it has
           an important role to play in the society.
           Therefore, every effort should be made in the
           interest of the individuals in order to enable them
           to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the
           parties ponder over their defaults and terminate
           their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

Crl.M.C.No.3835 of 2013
                                  7

           instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in
           order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
           matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
           exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
           to state that the power under Section 482 should
           be exercised sparingly and with circumspection
           only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of
           material on record, that allowing the proceedings
           to continue would be an abuse of the process of
           the Court or that the ends of justice require that
           the proceedings ought to be quashed."

Overlooking the settlement arrived, if the trial is allowed to

stand, the net result would be sheer waste of time which

will amounts to abuse of process of court.

         In the result this M.C. is allowed quashing

Annexure-I FIR and Annexure-2 final report and all further

proceedings pending against the 2nd respondent in C.C.No.

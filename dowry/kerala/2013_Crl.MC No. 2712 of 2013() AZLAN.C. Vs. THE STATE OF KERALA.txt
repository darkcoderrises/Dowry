                   Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
               -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 04th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 5 in C.P.No.30 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Hosdurg which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.238 of 2012 of Chandera Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 & 308 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.238 of 2012 of

Chandera Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.P.No.30 of 2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg as the matter

is settled out of court.

     2.    The allegation against the accused is that, on

14/04/2012 at 8 p.m. the accused 5 in numbers and 5 other

Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
                            :-2-:


identifiable persons formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly at Vellappu in Trikaripur Village, wrongfully

restrained the de facto complainant and assaulted him with an

iron rod striking over his left eye. According to the

prosecution, if the de facto complainant has not been timely

evaded, the blow would have caused his death and thus the

accused has committed the offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 & 308 read with Section 149 of

IPC.   Now the case of the petitioner is that, the dispute

between themselves and the second respondent, who is the de

facto complainant, is settled out of court as they are

neighbours. The second respondent herein appeared through

the counsel and he had also sworn into Annexure-A3 affidavit.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
                              :-3-:


matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and he has no grievance against

them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A3 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
                                    :-4-:


323, 324 & 308 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. which are more

or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It

is pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the

injured/the victim/the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in

which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
                                       :-5-:


         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

Crl.M.C.No.2712 of 2013
                             :-6-:


encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.238 of 2012 of

Chandera Police Station and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioners in C.P.No.30 of 2013 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg.

                     Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014
                   ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 4th day of November, 2014.

                              O R D E R



     The three petitioners herein are the accused Nos.1 to 3 in

the impugned Annexure-A FIR in Crime No.113/2014 of

Payyannur Police Station, Kannur District.          The police after

investigation has submitted Annexure-B Final Report/Charge

Sheet on 24.5.2014 in the impugned Annexure-A Crime

No.113/2014 of Payyannur Police Station which has led to the

pendency of committal proceedings, C.P.No.71/2014 on the file

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur. The 2nd

respondent is the defacto complainant and the 3rd respondent

is CW2.    The complaint of the 2nd respondent was that the

accused Nos. 1 & 2 trespassed into her house alleging that her

son 3rd respondent had taken photos of a bathing lady, who is

their relative residing adjacent to the house of the defacto

complainant, while he went there for taking water from their

well and threatened that her house would be burned and

destroyed    and    forcefully   took    the   3rd  respondent   for

questioning to various places till the next day and assaulted

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

him with various weapons and caused injuries and the

petitioners herein obstructed him from moving anywhere and a

written complaint was filed alleging offences punishable under

Secs.452, 506, 363, 342, 323, 24 r/w 34 IPC and Sec.23 of

the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2000.

It is stated that the petitioners and defacto complainant and

her family members including CW2 (R3) are neighbours and

friendly and that sudden provocation of the 3rd respondent by

taking bathing scene of the lady related to the petitioners

triggered the issue and the subsequent complaint by the 2nd

respondent, it is averred. It is now stated that the disputes

between the petitioners and respondents 2 & 3 has been

settled due to intervention of well wishers and by the advice of

the Jama Ath Committee and now the petitioners and their

family and family of the 2nd respondent have no enmity

between them and cordial relationship between those parties

have been restored.     Therefore, no useful purpose will be

served in continuing the criminal proceedings.         The 2nd

respondent has filed affidavit dated 24.9.2014 produced as

Annexure-C in this Crl.M.C stating the above aspects and

further stating that the accused persons and the 2nd

                              ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

respondent are neighbours and that the incident happened due

to the sudden provocation and the matter has been settled by

the intervention of the well wishers and Jama Ath Committee

and she and her son has no grievance against the petitioners

and both parties are living peacefully as neighbours and that

they are in good terms with the accused and that they do not

want the relationship frustrated and no purpose will be served

in continuing the criminal proceedings against the accused and

that the impugned criminal proceedings may be quashed etc.

It is in the background of these facts and circumstance the

instant crl.M.C has been filed seeking the prayer to quash the

impugned criminal proceedings.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.T.T.Rakesh,

Advocate, has taken notice for the respondents 2 & 3 and the

learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard Sri.Gracious Kuriakose, Senior Advocate,

learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, Sri.T.T.Rakesh,

learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 & 3 and the

learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent.

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.T.T.Rakesh,    learned   counsel   appearing   for

respondents 2 & 3 has submitted on the basis of the specific

instructions furnished by respondents 2 & 3 that respondents 2

& 3 have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and

that they have no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured

does not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners

as they have no grievance against them and that they will not

raise any dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing

the impugned final report is allowed.

                               ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondents

2 & 3, it is clear to the Court that the injured/victim/defacto

complainant     has   no   further      grievance   against   the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived at by

them.

      8.   In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect

                                   ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

                               ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.5509 Of 2014

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-B Final Report/Charge Sheet in the impugned

Annexure-A FIR in Crime No.13/2014 of Payyannur Police

Station which has led to the institution of C.P.No.71/2014 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyanur

and all further proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed.

Petitioners shall produce certified copies of this order to the

Station House Office concerned as well as to the jurisdictional

Magistrate concerned.



                                         ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                  Judge.

                    B.A.No.5807 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
         Dated this the 13th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R

       Apprehending arrest in Crime No.385/14 of Aryanad

Police Station, the accused nos.1 to 3 therein preferred this

application for anticipatory bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

     2.  The prosecution allegation is that, the marriage

between the de facto complainant and one Vinod Kumar was

solemnised    on   12.5.2013      at   Sreevidhya  Auditorium,

Nedumangad as per Hidnu rites and ceremonies and the

accused persons are mother, brother and father of the above

said Vinod Kumar. After the marriage, the accused persons

misappropriated 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments which was

given by her parents at the time of marriage. After that the

accused persons manhandled the de facto complainant for

bringing more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

                               2

      4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that the petitioners are implicated in the above crime due to

certain family disputes and that too without approaching the

police initially. So, according to the learned counsel, the

entire allegations are incorrect and baseless. On the other

hand, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that though

initially in the crime, sections 323 and 354 of IPC were

included along with sections 498A, 352 r/w 34 of IPC, after

investigation sections 304 and 323 are deleted. It is the

further submission of the learned Public Prosecutor that no

overtact is alleged against the petitioners.

      5. I have carefully considered the submissions made by

the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

      6. The 1st petitioner is a lady aged 53 years, whereas

the 3rd petitioner, who is her husband, is aged 60 years. It

appears that as there is no specific allegation against the

petitioners, the custodial interrogation of the petitioners are

B.A.No.5807 of 2014
                                   3

not required and therefore this petition can be allowed,

however subject to strict conditions.

      In the result, this petition is allowed and there will be a

direction that in the event of arrest of the petitioners

connected with Crime No.385/14 of Aryanad Police Station,

they shall be released on bail on each of them executing a

bond for Rs.35,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the

like amount to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in

the above crime and on the following other conditions :

             1.   The 2nd petitioner is directed to report before the
             Investigating Officer in the above Crime between 10
             and 11 a.m. on every Saturdays once in a fortnight
             and the petitioner nos.1 and 3 are directed to report
             before the Investigating Officer in the above crime as
             and when required.

            2.    The  petitioners    shall   co-operate   with   the
            investigation and they shall not interfere with the
            same or attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper
            the evidence.

               ---------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 14th day of September, 2012


                              O R D E R

       The husband who is arrayed as accused in Crime No.489 /

2012 of Kunnikode Police Station for having committed offences

punishable under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code is before

this Court seeking anticipatory bail. The marriage between the

petitioner and the defacto complainant is said to have taken

place on 4.2.2005 and there are two children in their wedlock.

Allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner subjected

the defacto complainant to mental cruelty by demanding more

gold and money as dowry.

       2. Considering the nature of allegation against the

petitioner and also the fact that the marriage took place in the

year 2005 it is felt that this is a fit case to show leniency on the

petitioner by exercising extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court

in his favour. The petition is allowed as follows:

       1) The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

Officer on or before 25.9.2012, who after interrogation shall

produce the petitioner before the JFCM court concerned which

court on application for bail filed by the petitioner shall release

him on bail on their executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees

B.A.No.6555/2012                      2


Fifteen thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like sum to the satisfaction of the learned JFCM concerned.

       2) The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts, before granting

bail.

       3) The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating

Officer for interrogation as and when required by him.

       4) The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper

with the evidence and influence or try to influence the

witnesses.

       5) If any of the condition is violated, the bail granted shall

stand cancelled and the learned JFCM concerned, of being

satisfied of the said fact, may take such proceedings as are

available to him in law.



                                              P.BHAVADASAN,
                                                     Judge.

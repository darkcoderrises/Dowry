          Dated this the 30th day of January, 2012.

                                  ORDER



          Aggrieved by the order dated 11.10.2011 in

Crl.A. No.25 of 2011, the respondents before the lower

appellate court have come up in revision. The parties

and facts are hereinafter referred to as they are

available before the trial court.

          2. It appears that the petitioner, who is the

first respondent herein, filed an application under

Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic

Violence Act claiming various reliefs. According to her,

the marriage between her and the first respondent

before the court below took place on 13.7.2000 as per

the customary rites. Second respondent before the court

below   is the mother of the first respondent and third

respondent is the father of the first respondent. It is

claimed that after the marriage, the couple took up

Crl.R.P.140/12.               2

residence in the shared house, wherein the other

respondents were also residing.      Various allegations are

made regarding the gold ornaments and other articles given

at the time of marriage, which are alleged to have been

misappropriated by the respondents. Allegations are also

made regarding the demand for further dowry and

ill-treatment on that basis. A child was born to the couple.

It is claimed that neither the child nor the petitioner was

looked after by the first respondent nor was any

maintenance provided to them. Claiming various amounts,

she laid a claim before the court concerned, which included

price of the gold ornaments etc., given at the time of

marriage, damages, and also maintenance.

             3. The respondents resisted the petition. It is

contended on behalf of the respondents that the petitioner

has been filing petitions after petitions before various

authorities with the sole intention of harassing the

respondents. They denied the allegations in the petition. It

Crl.R.P.140/12.                 3

is pointed out that the allegations are without any basis.

They prayed for a dismissal of the petition.

             4. Before the trial court, evidence was adduced.

The evidence consists of the testimony of P.Ws.1 and 2 and

documents marked as Exts. P1 to P5 from the side of the

petitioners.    The first respondent examined himself as

R.W.1 and had Exts.D1 to D4 marked. The trial court after

observing that no specific overt act of domestic violence

within the meaning of Protection of Women from Domestic

Violence Act is made out and also taking into consideration

the dismissal of the other proceedings initiated      by the

petitioner before the other authorities, dismissed the

petition.

             5. Petitioner before the court below took up the

matter in Crl.Appeal No.25 of 2011. The lower appellate

court found that none of the reasons given by the trial court

for dismissing the petition are          sustainable and the

allegations in the complaint are supported by evidence. It

Crl.R.P.140/12.               4

was also found that the reason given to reject the various

claims on the ground that the Family Court had dismissed a

petition filed by the petitioner is not a reason to reject the

claim of the petitioner before the trial court. Referring to

the pleadings and the evidence, the lower appellate court

felt that the matter has to be reconsidered by the trial

court. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the matter

was remanded to the trial court for fresh disposal.

             6. Learned counsel appearing for the revision

petitioners pointed out that the trial court had considered

the evidence in considerable detail and there was no

justification   in  remanding      the   matter   for   fresh

consideration.    It is also contended that various other

proceedings were initiated by the petitioner before the trial

court and all of them ended in failure. It was these facts

including the fact that no particular acts of domestic

violence were attributed or       alleged or proved, which

persuaded the trial court to dismiss the petition.       It is

Crl.R.P.140/12.                  5

therefore contended that there is no justification for the

remand.

             7. After having gone through the orders of the

courtsbelow, this court is unable to accept the contention

of the revision petitioner. The lower appellate court

referred to the allegations in the petition        and also the

evidence in considerable detail and found that the reasons

that persuaded the trial court to reject the petition are

unsustainable. The lower appellate court felt that the trial

court       had not applied the correct law and had not

appreciated the evidence in the right perspective. It was in

these circumstances, the lower appellate court was of the

view that the matter needed fresh consideration at the

hands of the trial court.

             8. It could not be said that the observations of the

lower appellate court are without basis.             The lower

appellate court has only remanded the matter for fresh

consideration of the trial court. It is felt that no particular

Crl.R.P.140/12.                  6

prejudice has been caused to the revision petitioner by the

said order as they also get an opportunity to agitate their

contentions afresh.

             There is no infirmity in the order of the lower

appellate court.     However, the trial court is directed to

dispose of the matter in accordance with law untramelled

by any of the observations made by the lower appellate

court or this court while disposing of the appeal and the

revision petition. The trial court may make every endeavour

to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible, at any

rate within a period of six months from the date of receipt

of a copy of this order. Send a copy of this order to the trial

court.

             The revision petition is disposed of as above.

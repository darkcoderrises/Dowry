                    Crl.M.C. No. 615 of 2015
             =======================
            Dated this the 6th day of February, 2015

                           O R D E R



      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.81/13 of the

Erumappetty Police Station, Thrissur registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 406, 420, 354 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-AI FIR in Crime

No.81/13 of the Erumappetty Police Station, Thrissur and all

proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1195/13 pending before the

Judicial   First  Class   Magistrate's  Court,    Wadakkanchery,

quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

Crl.M.C. No. 615 of 2015
                                  2

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints      against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaint against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.                She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

Crl.M.C. No. 615 of 2015
                                   3

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I FIR in

Crime No No.81/13 of the Erumappetty Police Station, Thrissur

and all proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1195/13 pending

before     the      Judicial  First   Class   Magistrate's  Court,

Wadakkanchery, are hereby quashed.

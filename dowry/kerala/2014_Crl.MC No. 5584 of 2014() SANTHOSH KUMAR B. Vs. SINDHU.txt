                      ----------------------------------------
                         Crl.M.C.No. 5584 of 2014
                      ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 1st day of October, 2014

                                   O R D E R

           The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioner, who is

the accused    in C.C.No.100 of 2013 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Alappuzha, which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.621/2010 of Alappuzha North Police Station, Alappuzha for the

offences punishable under Section 498 A of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-I FIR in Crime No.621/2010 of Alappuzha North Police

Station, Alappuzha which is now pending as C.C.No.100/2013 on the file

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Alappuzha as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2.  The allegation against the petitioner in the above case is that

after having married the first respondent on 4.6.2000 in accordance with

the rites and custom prevailing among their community, the petitioner

harassed the first respondent both mentally and physically demanding mor

                                     :-2-:

dowry and thus, committed the aforesaid offences.                With the said

allegation, the first respondent filed a private complaint and finally,

instituted the above case. Now, the case of the petitioner and the first

respondent is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

counsel for the first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the parties

to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

Crl.M.C.No.5584 of 2014

                                            :-3-:

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offence involved in the above case is only Section 498A,

which is more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offence is involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From

the submission made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.                    In this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision

reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on
          considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints
          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but
          also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such
          matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
          home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

                                             :-4-:

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of
         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under
         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on
         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under
         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash
         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the
         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and
         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and
         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties
         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a
         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said
         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on
         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants
         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement
         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit
         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against
         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It
         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected
         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its
         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the
         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections
         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."
                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage
         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same
         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-
         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any
         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section
         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.
                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in
         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place
         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them
         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their
         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement
         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice
         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power
         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection
         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that
         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of
         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to
         be quashed."

Crl.M.C.No.5584 of 2014

                                     :-5-:

In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A of I.P.C.

The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated from the matrimonial

issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the

criminal case as well.

         8.   According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in

the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings. Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure-I FIR

in Crime No.621/2010 of Alappuzha North Police Station, Alappuzha

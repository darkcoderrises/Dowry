                     Crl.M.C. No. 927 of 2015
            ..............................................................
          Dated this the 25th day of February, 2015.


                            O R D E R

           Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1082 of 2013 of

the Aluva East Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Sections 498 A and 323 read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR and Annexure

-A3 Final report in Crime No.1082 of 2013 of the Aluva East

Police Station and all further proceedings based on it, in

C.C.No.937 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Aluva, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

Crl.M.C. No. 927 of 2015        2

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints    against  the   petitioners    and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.   The defacto complainant, who is the 3rd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.              She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. Through a settlement, the 1st petitioner and the 3rd

Crl.M.C. No. 927 of 2015           3

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life.

       8. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1 FIR

and Annexure A3 Final Report in Crime No.1082 of 2013 of the

Aluva East Police Station and all further proceedings based on

it, in C.C.No.937 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Aluva are hereby quashed.

         Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014

                                 O R D E R


     Hyzel Stuwert, a young lady in the beginning of her

youth, was found dead in suspicious circumstances at the

matrimonial home, during the night of 06.07.2012. The

unfortunate father of the girl has come up with this Crl.M.C.

under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking an expeditious disposal

of  S.C.No.1570/2014             for     offences          punishable     under

Sections 498A, 304B and 201 read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code pending before the First Additional

Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram, in respect of her

death.

     2.   The case forwarded by the investigating officer

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



through the final report in Crime No.795/2012 of the

Vizhinjam Police Station, the investigation of which was

subsequently handed over to the Crime Branch who re-

registered the case as Crime 744/CR/HHW-1/12, in short, is

as follows: Deceased Hyzel Stuwert, daughter of the

petitioner herein, while she was a student of the Mar Ivanius

College, Thiruvananthapuram, was enticed by the first

accused in the year 2007. She went along with him and

they resided together at several places. Thereafter, the first

accused, and A2 to A5, who are the mother, brothers and

sister of the first accused, started demanding dowry from

the petitioner, for solemnizing the marriage. As the petitioner

had no other go than to heed to their demand for

solemnizing the marriage of his daughter, he gave 55

sovereigns of gold ornaments and an amount of 8 lakhs as

dowry to the first accused. Three months after the marriage

the first accused went to gulf in connection with his job.

Subsequently, Hyzel Stuwert developed ailments to her

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                             -: 3 :-



kidney and heart. She was not provided with medical

treatment or medicines. She was not given any rest and she

was burdened with all the heavy works at the house. She

was not being permitted to go to her house or to meet her

relatives. The first accused returned from gulf. The other

accused gave him false and exaggerated versions regarding

the defects which they could find in the victim. On hearing

it, the victim was being severely beaten up by the first

accused. In the mean time, some properties of the parents

of the victim were acquired for the development of the

Vizhinjam Port, for which the parents got an amount of 1=

crores. On coming to know about it, the accused directed

the victim to procure an amount of 50 lakhs more, by way

of dowry from it. Even though the parents of the victim paid

an amount of 5 lakhs more, the victim was being

continuously tortured and harassed by demanding 50

lakhs.

      3.    On 04.07.2012 the deceased had attended the

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                                 -: 4 :-



funeral of the son of her mother's elder sister. As she was

little bit late in returning, she was severely beaten up by the

first accused. As she could not withstand the harassment,

she allegedly attempted to commit suicide. On seeing it, the

first accused called A2 to A5 and in their presence she was

severely beaten up. She was slapped and fisted repeatedly

on her cheeks and lips. It is alleged that after leaving the

deceased alone, all the accused went out. During that time,

in between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. she committed suicide

by hanging on the ceiling fan in the bed room situated on

the first floor of the building. It is alleged that on seeing it,

the first accused called A2 to A5 and all of them cut and

removed the rope and took her to the Community Health

Centre, Vizhinjam. The accused had allegedly concealed

the fact of hanging by the deceased and told the doctor that

she was suffering from heart attack. From there, she was

taken to Ananthapuri Hospital where she allegedly died on

07.07.2012 at 2.30 a.m. According to the investigating

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                                -: 5 :-



officer, it is dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B

IPC and accused have committed the offences punishable

under Sections 498A, 304B and 201 read with Section 34

IPC.

      4.     From the very beginning, there was a lethargic

attitude on the part of the local police in conducting the

investigation. It seems that the accused are highly influential

and they have influenced the Police. Even though the

postmortem certificate has revealed very serious injuries all

over the body of the deceased, nothing was done by the

Police. The petitioner herein was running from pillar to post

to get the matter properly investigated. Ultimately, some

how, the investigation was handed over to the Crime

Branch. The Crime Branch Dy.S.P. completed and concluded

the investigation and laid the final report as aforesaid.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all along he has

suspected the unnatural death of his daughter as a clear

case of murder. All his cries were unheard. According to the

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                              -: 6 :-



petitioner, his wife, who was a prime witness in the case,

died due to mental pain on account of the tragic death of

their daughter. According to the petitioner, he strongly beliefs

that his daughter was brutally murdered by the accused.

CW8 in the case is a prime witness and it seems that she

was terribly attacked by the accused with a view to

disuading her from giving evidence in the case, for which,

Crime No.1472/12 of the Vizhinjam Police Station, was

registered against the accused for the offences punishable

under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(i) and 323 read with

Section 34 IPC and the same is pending as C.C.921/2013

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Neyyattinkara.

According to the petitioner, the accused who have money

power and muscle power have influence over the Police,

and that they have intimidated the witnesses and are trying

to protract the trial of the case in order to win over the

witnesses by threatening and intimidating them. The

petitioner is also undergoing treatment for heart ailments

                               -: 7 :-



and other illness related to old age. He wants to see that

justice is done in the matter and that is why he has

approached this Court to have a direction to the court below

for expeditious disposal of the case.

      6.    While dealing with the matter, this Court has gone

through the copy of the postmortem certificate of the victim

produced as Annexure II by the petitioner. The following

ante-mortem injuries are noted on the body:

           25.        Fracture   of     sternum between

             manubrium first pieces of body.

             side at the angle."

      7.    On going through the postmortem certificate it

can be seen that there is not even an inch of space in her

body which is free from injuries. There were several

contusions all over her body which clearly indicate that she

was severely beaten up. There were severe internal injuries.

There were multiple abraded contusions 12 x 7.5 cm on the

front of lower part of chest and upper part of abdomen.

There was contusion on diaphragm. There was contusion

involving the left lobe of liver. There were multiple abrasions

over an area of 13 x 10.5 cm on the left side of chest and

abdomen. Apart from all the above, there were several

contusions on her limbs and other parts of the body. Her

sternum was fractured. There were fractures on 4th and 5th

ribs on the right side. Can it be believed that a person who

has sustained these much of ante-mortem injuries could

climb over some thing in order to reach the fan on the roof

and to hang for committing suicide?

      8. On seeing these much of injuries in the postmortem

certificate, this Court has assumed jurisdiction under Article

226 of the Constitution of India, relying on the decision in

M/s Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate

[AIR1998 SC 128]. It is settled law that High Court can

exercise its power of judicial review in criminal matters. The

nomenclature under which the petition is filed is not quite

relevant and that does not debar the Court from exercising

its jurisdiction which otherwise it possesses.

      9.     This Court has impleaded Additional Director

General       of      Police(Crimes)     as  additional    R2,

Sri.N.Jayakumar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, CBCID-

HHW-I, Jawahar Nagar, Thiruvananthapuram, who filed the

final report in the case, as additional R3 and the accused as

additional respondents 4 to 8.

      10. Heard Sri. S. Rajeev, the learned counsel for the

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                              -: 14 :-



petitioner, Sri.P.Vijayabhanu, learned Senior Counsel for the

accused who are additional respondents R4 to R8 and

Sri.Asaf Ali, the Director General of Prosecution.

      11. The learned Senior Counsel for Additional

respondents has made an attempt to explain the

antemortem injuries found on the body of the deceased as

injuries, which have resulted from resuscitation attempts

resorted to by doctors to resuscitate the deceased who was

suffering from heart ailments. The said explanation can only

be taken with a pinch of salt. Can it be believed that injuries

to diaphragm, liver etc. were caused in such attempts by

doctors. Fractures on sternum and two ribs on the right side

were also there. Injuries all over the body from face to feet

were there.

      12. If, as a matter of fact, the victim had hung herself,

why the accused had concealed the said fact? Can it not be

a case wherein the deceased was hung by the accused

thinking that she was dead on the infliction of such severe

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                               -: 15 :-



injuries all over her body? It seems that the investigating

officer has not even thought of any such possibilities. The

whole investigation is shabby.          On going through the

explanation given by the investigating officer, it seems that

he has laboured much to take out the offence from the

category of murder. It seems that the investigating officer

has believed and relied on the versions of the accused and

has not taken care of the circumstances involved in the

crime. In a case where the death of a woman is caused by

any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under

normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage

and if it is shown that soon before her death she was

subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband or any

relative of her husband for any demand for dowry, it will

constitute an offence within the meaning of S.304B IPC.

Even if she is murdered, the offence under Section 304B

also will lie in the matter, over and above the offence under

Section 302 IPC. This Court is not making an opinion as to

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                               -: 16 :-



whether an offence under Section 302 is there in this case

or not. At the same time, this Court is of the view that the

investigation conducted by the present investigating officer,

who is the 3rd additional respondent herein, was not proper

and adequate. The apprehension forwarded by the

petitioner seems to be genuine.

      13. Sri. Asaf Ali, the learned Director General of

Prosecution, has fairly conceded that the investigation was

not on proper lines and there are lacunae in the

investigation. The learned DGP has also considered the

contents of the postmortem certificate. The learned DGP

has undertaken that a fair investigation can be conducted by

the Crime Branch itself and the Superintendent of Police,

Crime Branch will carry out the investigation by himself or by

making use of a team of high officers under him. Such team

shall not include the 3rd additional respondent herein.

      14. Matters being so, the final report filed by the 3rd

additional respondent in this case is liable to be quashed.

CRL.M.C.No.6464 of 2014
                              -: 17 :-



The Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, by himself or

with the assistance of a team under him shall conduct a

further investigation in the matter by himself or by making

use of a team of high officers under him, and such

investigation shall be completed within a period of three

months from today and he shall file a final report in the

matter.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of by quashing

the final report filed by the 3rd additional respondent and by

directing the Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch to

conduct a further investigation in the matter. He shall

complete such investigation and shall file a final report in the

matter, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a

period of three months from today.

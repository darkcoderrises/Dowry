              Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015-D
      ------------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of May, 2015

                            ORDER


       The petitioners herein are accused Nos.1 to 4

respectively in C.C.No.516 of 2008 on the files of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Mavelikkara

and the 2nd respondent is the de facto complainant.

The crime was registered alleging the offences

punishable under Secs.143, 147, 148, 149, 447 and

427 of the Indian Penal Code. But, after investigation,

final report was filed charging the offences punishable

under Secs.447 and 427 of the IPC only.

     2. Now, the petitioners and the 2nd respondent/the

de facto complainant have amicably settled the

disputes.      The de facto complainant has filed

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015      -: 2 :-

Annexure-3 affidavit stating that he does not want to

proceed with the prosecution as he has no subsisting

grievance at all.    He has no objection in quashing the

entire proceedings against the petitioners invoking

inherent jurisdiction under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C.

      3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,

learned counsel for the 2nd respondent and the learned

Public Prosecutor. The learned counsel for the

petitioners drew my attention to the decision reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108

(SC)].

      4. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench

of the Apex Court, on a reference, considered the

question whether the High Court has power to quash

criminal    proceedings   involving   non-compoundable

offences on the basis of the compromise reached

between the offender and the victim and answered as

given below:

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015         -: 3 :-

            "57. The position that emerges from

            the   above      discussion     can   be

            summarised thus: the power of the

            High Court in quashing a criminal

            proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

            exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

            distinct and different from the power

            given    to  a    criminal    court   for

            compounding      the   offences    under

            S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

            of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in

            accord with the guideline engrafted in

            such power viz;(1) to secure the ends

            of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

            the process of any Court.        In what

            cases power to quash the criminal

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may

            be exercised where the offender and

            victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and

            circumstances of each case and no

            category     can      be      prescribed.

            However, before exercise of such

            power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of

            the crime.      Heinous and serious

            offences   of   mental      depravity or

            offences like murder, rape, dacoity,

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015          -: 4 :-

            etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

            though the victim or victim's family

            and the offender have settled the

            dispute. Such offences are not private

            in nature and have serious impact on

            society.    Similarly, any compromise

            between the victim and offender in

            relation to the offences under special

            statutes like Prevention of Corruption

            Act or the offences committed by

            public servants while working in that

            capacity etc; cannot provide for any

            basis      for     quashing     criminal

            proceedings involving such offences.

            But     the   criminal    cases  having

            overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

            civil flavour stand on different footing

            for    the   purposes       of quashing,

            particularly the offences arising from

            commercial,      financial,   mercantile,

            civil,   partnership     or   such  like

            transactions or the offences arising

            out of matrimony relating to dowry,

            etc., or the family disputes where the

            wrong is basically private or personal

            in nature and the parties have

            resolved their entire dispute. In this

            category of cases, High Court may

            quash criminal proceedings if in its

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015          -: 5 :-

            view, because of the compromise

            between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and

            bleak and continuation of criminal

            case would put accused to great

            oppression     and      prejudice   and

            extreme injustice would be caused to

            him by not quashing the criminal

            case    despite   full   and   complete

            settlement and compromise with the

            victim. In other words, the High Court

            must consider whether it would be

            unfair or contrary to the interest of

            justice to continue with the criminal

            proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal        proceeding         would

            tantamount to abuse of process of

            law     despite     settlement      and

            compromise between the victim and

            wrongdoer and whether to secure the

            ends of justice, it is appropriate that

            criminal case is put to an end and if

            the answer to the above question(s)

            is in affirmative, the High Court shall

            be well within its jurisdiction to quash

            the criminal proceeding."

      5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015      -: 6 :-

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the

offences alleged against the petitioner will not come

under the category of non-compoundable offences,

which are specifically excluded from composition, in

the exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C.   Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto

complainant, it is seen that the dispute between the

accused and the victim had been amicably settled

and, at present, the de facto complainant has no

subsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant

does not want to proceed with prosecution against the

accused.     Full and final settlement and compromise

with the victim are evidenced by Annexure-A3.        In

view of the compromise between the petitioner and

the victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is

remote, bleak and continuation of the criminal case

would, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice

Crl.M.C. No.2765 of 2015        -: 7 :-

and also tantamount to abuse of the process of the

court.    The present criminal prosecution against the

accused must be put to an end to secure the interest

of justice.

      6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against the petitioners under Annexure-2 Final Report

are quashed in exercise of jurisdiction and power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

                            B.A. NO.3844 OF 2014
                        -----------------------------------------
                     Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014

                                       ORDER

       Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

       2.   Petitioners are accused 1 and 2                in Crime No.135/2014 of

Mankada Police Station registered for the offences under Sections 498 and

306 r/w Section 34 IPC.

       3.    The 1st petitioner married the daughter of the de facto

complainant.     The 2nd petitioner is the 1st petitioner's mother. The 1st

petitioner's wife committed suicide on 27.4.2014 at her parents' residence.

It is alleged by the prosecution that the petitioners had subjected her to

cruelty both physical and mental demanding more dowry and for other

reasons. The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that

the allegations are false. It is evident from the fact that within a reasonable

time from the suicide of the victim no such allegation was raised.

       4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       5.    The marriage of the 1st petitioner and the victim was

solemnized about 2 = years ago. They have a child aged 1= years. The

was doing a PG course. It is seen from the statements of the father of the

victim, which was recorded ten days after the commission of the suicide by

the victim that there were domestic problems in the family of the 1st

petitioner. It is alleged that the petitioners demanded more dowry from the

B.A. NO.3844 OF 2014                       2

victim's parents. The serious allegation against the petitioners is that in

the course of a quarrel they asked the victim to go and die. Except this

allegation, no other serious allegation has been raised against the

petitioners. In view of the decision in Madan Mohan Singh Vs. State

of Gujarat and Another (2010(8) SC 628) it is doubtful whether this

statement alone will be sufficient to attract the offence of Section 306

IPC. Having regard to facts disclosed in the statements recorded by the

police Section 161 Cr.P.C, I am of the opinion that granting anticipatory

bail to the petitioners will not adversely affect the investigation.

       In the result, this Bail application is allowed with the following

conditions:

       1)     The petitioners shall be released on bail on their executing

a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees twenty five thousand only) each with two

solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the learned

Magistrate.

       2)    The 1st petitioner      shall appear before the Investigating

Officer between 10.30 a.m and 11.30 a.m on every 1st and 3rd Saturdays

for three months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier.

       3)    The 2nd petitioner shall       appear before the Investigating

Officer between 10.30 a.m and 11.30 a.m on the last Saturday of this

month and the 2nd Saturday of the next month.

       4)    They shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

B.A. NO.3844 OF 2014                    3

      5)     The petitioners shall not intimidate or attempt to influence

the witnesses.

       This order is not applicable if the petitioners choose to surrender

before the Magistrate concerned and in such case the learned

Magistrate may take appropriate action in accordance with the law.

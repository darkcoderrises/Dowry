                    B.A.No.5398 of 2014
              ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of August, 2014

                             ORDER


     Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.814 of

2014 of the Alappuzha North Police station and apprehending

arrest they preferred the above application under Section 438

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking Anticipatory Bail.

     2.    The prosecution allegation is that the marriage

between the first petitioner/first accused and the de facto

complainant were solemnized on 22.05.2010 and the de facto

complainant was residing in her matrimonial home. There she

gave birth to a female child. The deceased was subjected to

cruelty and was harassed saying that the gold ornaments given

were insufficient and accordingly demanded more dowry. It is

the further case of the prosecution that on 25.06.2014 there

was a function in the house of the de facto complainant in

connection with the 28th day function of the child of the sister

of the deceased. On that day, the first petitioner/first accused

telephoned her from gulf and scolded her. On the next day, the

de facto complainant was compelled to go back to her

matrimonial house and at about 05.00 O' clock the deceased

B.A.No.5398 of 2014
                                2

left the house of the first accused in her kinetic honda scooter

and she jumped in front of a train in a nearby railway track and

thereby committed suicide. Thus according to the prosecution

the accused three in number mentally and physically harassed

the deceased and as the harassment was intolerable, the

deceased was driven out to commit suicide and thus the

accused have       committed the offences punishable under

Sections 498A, 306 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.   Heard the counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      4.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

after the marriage the deceased was happy with the first

petitioner and her in-laws and there was no complaint from her

either against the first petitioner or the other accused. It is

further submitted that there is no material to attract the

offence under Section 306 of IPC. Hence the petitioners are

entitled to get an order under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      5.   Learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand

opposing the application, it is submitted that the deceased has

committed suicide solely     on the base of the telephone call

received from the first accused on 25.06.2014.

B.A.No.5398 of 2014
                                 3

      6.   I have carefully considered the submission made by

the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public

Prosecutor. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case and especially in the light of the overt act

alleged against the petitioners, I am of the view that the first

petitioner is not entitled to get the relief as sought for. The

custody of the first petitioner probably required connected with

the investigation. However, the second petitioner who is the

mother of the first petitioner is aged 60 years and therefore,

according to me this petition can be allowed in favour of the

second petitioner.

      In the result, the above petition is disposed of dismissing

the petition with respect to the first petitioner, but allowing the

same in favour of the 2nd petitioner and there will be a direction

in favour of the second petitioner that in the event of arrest of

the second petitioner connected with Crime No.814 of 2014 of

the Alappuzha North Police station, she shall be released on

bail on her executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty

Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for like amount

to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above

crime and on the following further conditions:

      (a)  The second petitioner shall report before the

B.A.No.5398 of 2014
                                 4

Investigating Officer as and when required.

     (b)   The second petitioner shall not interfere with the

investigation.

     (c)   The second petitioner shall not influence/intimidate

the witnesses or shall not try to tamper the evidence.

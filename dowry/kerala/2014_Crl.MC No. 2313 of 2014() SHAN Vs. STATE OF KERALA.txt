               Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014
              -------------------------------
         Dated this the 29th day of May, 2014

                          ORDER




       This is an application filed by the petitioner who

is the 3rd accused in C.C. No. 127/2013 on the files of

the    Judicial   First   Class   Magistrate's    Court-I,

Nedumangad, to quash the proceedings on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter referred as the 'Code').

     2. It is alleged in the petition that he is the 3rd

accused in C.C. No. 127/2013 on the files of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad. The case

was registered as Crime No.339/2010 of Venjaramoodu

Police Station on the basis of the statement given by the

de facto complainant against the petitioner and three

others   alleging   offenses punishable under Sections

323, 324 read with Section 34 IPC. After investigation,

Annexure A final report was filed and the case was

originally taken on file as C.C.No.47/2011 on the files of

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014      2

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad.

While so, the matter has been settled between the

parties.    The accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 along with this

petitioner moved this Court for quashing the proceedings

as Crl.M.C. 3671/2012 and this Court by Annexure E

order quashed the proceedings as against them on the

basis of the settlement.     Since the petitioner did not

comply with the interim direction, this Court quashed the

proceedings against accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 alone. After

quashing the proceedings as against the accused Nos.1, 2

and 4, the case against the present petitioner was re

filed as C.C No.127/2013. Now it is pending before the

same court. The matter has been settled between the

petitioner and the injured who are shown as respondent

Nos. 2 to 4 in this petition.   Since some of the offence

are non compoundable in nature, they cannot file the

application before the court below.      So they have no

other remedy except to approach this Court seeking the

following relief.

              "to quash Annexure A final report,

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014       3

         pending as C.C.No.127/2013 on the files of

         the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court

         -I, Nedumangad"

      3. The respondents 2 to 4 appeared through counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled between

the parties and they have filed Annexures B, C, and D

affidavits and in view of the settlement they do not want

to proceed with the case against the petitioner also. The

counsel for the petitioner also submitted that the case

against the other accused persons has been quashed by

this Court as per Annexure E order and in view of the

settlement,     no purpose will be served in keeping the

case as well.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the

application on the ground that Section 324 of the Indian

Penal Code has been incorporated.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by 2nd respondent, Crime No. 339/2010

of Venjaramoodu Police Station was registered against

the petitioner and three others alleging offences under

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014       4

Sections 323, 324 read with 34 of the Indian Penal code

and after investigation, Annexure A final report was filed

and it was taken on file originally as C.C.No.47/2011 by

the     learned     Judicial First Class    Magistrate   -I,

Nedumangad.          While so, the matter has been settled

between the parties. The accused Nos. 1, 2 and 4 along

with the petitioner had filed Crl.M.C.No.3671/2012 before

this Court and this Court by Annexure E order quashed

the proceedings as against accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 alone as

this petitioner could not surrender and take bail as

directed by this Court and it is thereafter the case against

the present petitioner was refiled as C.C.No.127/2013.

Now the matter has been settled between the present

petitioner and the respondents 2 to 4 as well. Further it

is also seen from the allegations that the incident

happened in the college in connection with the festival

conducted there.        Now after the settlement    original

relationship has been restored between them.        Further

case against other accused persons has been already

quashed by this Court as well. In view of the settlement,

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014          5

there is no possibility of       conviction in such cases.      It

cannot be said to be a case of public interest,                but

happened in the college campus due to some mis

understanding in the conduct of function in the college.

      6. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State

of Punjab [(2012(4)KLT 108(SC)], it has been held

as follows:

                  "The position that emerges from the above

      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.

      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

      distinct and different from the power given to a

      criminal court for compounding the offences under

      S.320 of the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in

      such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)

      to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what

      cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or

      complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the

      offender and victim have settled their dispute would

      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case

      and no category can be prescribed. However, before

      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due

      regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous

      and serious offences of mental depravity or offences

      like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014           6

      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and

      the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences

      are not private in nature and have serious impact on

      society.   Similarly, any compromise between the

      victim and offender in relation to the offences under

      special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or

      the offences committed by public servants while

      working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any

      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such

      offences.    But     the    criminal    cases    having

      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

      stand on different footing for the purposes of

      quashing,    particularly the   offences  arising  from

      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or

      such like transactions or the offences arising out of

      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

      disputes where the wrong is basically private or

      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

      entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court

      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

      of the compromise between the offender and victim,

      the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

      continuation of criminal case would put accused to

      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

      case   despite full and     complete    settlement  and

      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

      Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014            7

      law despite settlement and compromise between the

      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

      of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

      end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding"



      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and and also considering the fact that the case

against other accused persons has already been quashed

and this case also settled between the injured persons

and the petitioner and no possibility of conviction in view

of the settlement and relationship has been restored

between the parties on account of the settlement, this

Court feels that this is a fit case where power under

Section 482 of the Code has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.127/2013 (Crime No.339/2010 of Venjaramoodu

Police Station) pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's      Court-I,     Nedumangad         as   against   the

petitioner is quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.2313 of 2014      8

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

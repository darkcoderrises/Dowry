              Crl.M.C.No.2190 of 2009
            --------------------------

                       ORDER



    Petitioners are accused 2 and 3 in   Crime No.

157/2008 of Vellikulangara Police Station. First

respondent  is  the   defacto  complainant.  First

respondent filed Annexure-A1 complaint against the

first accused, the son and petitioners/accused 2

and 3, his parents, alleging that they committed

offences under Sections 376 and 493 read with

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The complaint was

sent to the police for investigation under Section

156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure. Annexure-A2

FIR  was  registered   and  the   crime  is   being

investigated.  This petition is filed under Section

482 of Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the

proceedings as against the petitioners contending

that though the case is registered for the offences

under Section 376 and 493 read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code, later, on investigation, it was

CRMC 2190/09                2


found that first accused had married the first

respondent at Coimbatore and the offence attracted

is an offence under Section 498A of Indian Penal

Code   and    on  the   allegations    in   Annexure-A1

complaint,    no   offence   under   Section   493   is

attracted against the petitioners and therefore, it

is to be quashed.

    2.    Second respondent filed a statement stating

that after registration of the case for offences

under Sections 376 and 493 read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code, on the basis of investigation, a

report    was  filed  by   the  Investigating   Officer

before Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Chalakkudy deleting offences under Sections 376 and

493 and incorporating an offence under Section 498A

read with Section 34 of Indian penal Code and

investigation in the case is in progress.

    3.    Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,

second respondent and learned Public Prosecutor

were heard.

CRMC 2190/09              3


    4.     The  argument  of  the  learned  counsel

appearing    for  the   petitioners is   that  when

investigation revealed that only offence involved

is under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code and

allegations in Annexure-A1 complaint do not show

the ingredients of an offence under Section 498A of

Indian Penal Code as against the petitioners, the

proceedings as against them is to be quashed. It

was argued that Annexure-A1 complaint does not

contain any allegation that there was a demand for

dowry   and   much less,  at  the  instance of  the

petitioners and in such circumstances, the case as

against them is to be quashed.

    5. Learned counsel appearing for the first

respondent pointed that first respondent belongs to

Christian community and after coming into contact

with the first respondent, first accused made her

to believe that he will marry her and took her to

Thrissur and from there to Coimbatore and under the

guise that a marriage is being performed under the

CRMC 2190/09              4


Special Marriage Act, she was taken to a temple at

Coimbatore and a ceremony was performed, which will

not constitute a legal marriage and therefore, an

offence under Section 493 would, definitely, be

attracted and first respondent filed Crl.M.C.No.

2339/2009    for a   direction  to  conduct   proper

investigation in the case and in such circumstances,

the case cannot be quashed as sought for. Learned

counsel also pointed out that even if an offence

under   Section  498A  of   Indian  Penal  Code   is

attracted, there are sufficient allegations in the

complaint as against the petitioners and therefore,

in any event, the case cannot be quashed as sought

for.

    6. On hearing the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners and first respondent, I find no

valid reason to quash the case as against the

petitioners.   The question whether an offence under

Section 493 of Indian Penal Code is attracted or

not is to be decided in this petition, as the case

CRMC 2190/09               5


is under investigation. If the grievance of the

first   respondent   is  that  there  is   no  proper

investigation in the case, as held by the Apex

Court in Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P.(2008 (1) KLT

724(SC)), he is at liberty to approach the learned

Magistrate under Section 156(3) of Code of Criminal

Procedure for appropriate direction.

    7.     Learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that

as held by the Apex Court in    Subbharao v. State of

A.P. (2009 (2) KLT 531(SC)), to attract an offence

under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, a legal

marriage is not an absolute necessity and in such

circumstances, for the reason that there is no

legal marriage, it cannot be held that an offence

under Section 498A is attracted.       If an offence

under Section 498A is attracted, it cannot be said

that there are no sufficient allegations as against

the petitioners in Annexure-A1 complaint, as in

paragraph 3 of the complaint, there are specific

allegations as against the petitioners regarding

CRMC 2190/09              6


cruelty as provided under Section 498A of Indian

Penal Code. In such circumstances, investigation

cannot be quashed as sought for by the petitioners.

Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners then

submitted that second petitioner/third accused is

yet to surrender and there may be a direction to

the   Magistrate   to grant  bail  to   her.  Second

petitioner had already approached this Court for

anticipatory bail under Section 438 of Code of

Criminal     Procedure  unsuccessfully.   In    such

circumstances, she is not entitled to get the

relief as sought for.      It is up to the second

petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate and

seek regular bail.

     Petition is disposed.

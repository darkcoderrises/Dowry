             ------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 16th day of November, 2015.

                              O R D E R

            Application for pre-arrest bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.     Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2, who are husband

and mother-in-law of the defacto complainant in Crime No.3857 of

2015 of Perumbavoor Police Station registered for offences

punishable under Sections 498A I.P.C.

     3.     Prosecution case, in short, is that the petitioners mentally

harassed the defacto complainant by demanding more dowry and

thereby committed the aforementioned offence.

     4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.     Considering the nature of allegations, I find that bail can

be granted to the petitioners with following directions :

        1.   Petitioners    shall    surrender      before   the
            investigating officer within a period of two
            weeks from today and submit themselves for
            interrogation. In that event, they shall be
            released on bail on executing a bond for
            Rs.25,000/-      each    (Rupees      twenty     five
            thousand only) with two solvent sureties each
            for the like sum to the satisfaction of the

B.A No.7065 of 2015                  2




                Investigating Officer.
         2.    The sureties shall produce documents to
               establish their identity and solvency. The
               Investigating Officer need not insist on the
               solvency certificate, but other documents can
               also be perused to find out whether the sureties
               are solvent or not.
         3    Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating
               Officer as and when directed.
        4.     Petitioners shall not influence or intimidate
              witnesses.
        5.    If any of the above conditions is violated by the
               petitioners, the learned Magistrate having
               jurisdiction is free to cancel the bail.

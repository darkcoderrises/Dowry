                    O.P(Crl).No.660 of 2011

                  ---------------------------------------

             Dated this 21st day of February, 2011

                            JUDGMENT

      In view of the order I propose to pass notice to respondent

Nos.2 to 5 is dispensed with.

      2.   Petitioner is the de facto complainant in C.C.No.1620

of 2009 of the court of learned Judicial First Class Magistrate-I,

Chengannur.       The case originated on a private complaint

preferred by the petitioner against respondent Nos.2 to 5

alleging commission of offences under Sec.498A r/w Sec.34 of

the Indian Penal Code and Sec.4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

That complaint was forwarded to the police for investigation

under Sec.156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short,

"the     Code").     According to the petitioner police after

investigation submitted final report deleting 4th respondent from

the array of parties. But, petitioner was not given notice of the

said report. Petitioner learned about that when she was being

examined as PW1. Thereon petitioner filed Ext.P2, application

for further investigation under Sec.173(8) of the Code. Grievance

of petitioner is that the said petition has not been disposed of by

the learned Magistrate.        Prayer in this petition is to direct

O.P(Crl).No.660 of 2011
                                  -: 2 :-


learned Magistrate to pass orders on Ext.P2, application.

        3.    I have heard learned counsel and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.    Having regard to the circumstances stated, learned

Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Chengannur is directed to

disposed of Ext.P2, application filed by the petitioner under

Sec.173(8) of the Code as provided under law as early as possible

(if it is not already disposed of).

        This petition is disposed of as above.




                                (THOMAS P JOSEPH, JUDGE)

             Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

      Petitioners, two in number, are accused in Crime

No.1082/2013 of Kodungallur Police Station registered for

offence punishable under section 498A r/w section 34 IPC.

Investigation is now being continued for the offence under

section 304B IPC also.

      2. First petitioner is the son of second petitioner. The

above crime was registered over the unnatural death of the

wife of first petitioner, namely, Silvi, aged 29 years, who

committed suicide setting fire to herself pouring kerosene.

Occurrence took place at about 8 p.m. on 12-4-2013 at the

matrimonial home, and she succumbed to the burn injuries

at hospital on 19-4-2013. Crime was registered recording

the statement of victim, while she was in hospital, the next

day after the occurrence. Investigation is now being

continued for the offence of dowry death also, and it is now

BA 3099/2013                  2

in progress. At this stage petitioners have moved the above

application seeking the discretionary relief of anticipatory

bail.

       3. Learned counsel for petitioners inviting my

attention to the statement recorded from the victim,

submitted that she had not imputed cruelty or harassment

against first petitioner, husband, but only against second

petitioner, mother-in-law, and that being so, no case of

dowry death would lie against her husband. Her husband

was a passive spectator while she was harassed and ill-

treated by her mother-in-law was her version to the police,

according    to  counsel.   Allegations    imputed   against

petitioners are false and they are prepared to abide by any

condition imposed by this court, is the further submission of

counsel to urge for granting them pre-arrest bail.

       4.   Opposing    the  application,   learned   Public

Prosecutor    submitted    that   materials    gathered   by

investigating agency gave enough room to suspect

complicity of   both petitioners in causing the suicide of

BA 3099/2013                     3

victim, and this is not a fit case where petitioners can be

extended the discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail.

       5. Case diary has been produced for my perusal. In

the application moved by petitioners seeking discretionary

relief of anticipatory bail, it may be inappropriate to dilate

upon the allegations imputed to register the crime for the

offence on dowry death to consider the merit of the

submissions made by their counsel that the version of the

victim over the circumstances under which she set fire to

herself pouring kerosene would not inculpate her husband,

first petitioner. Suffice to state that in a case of dowry death

the essential ingredients to be established are that a

married     woman    died otherwise       than under normal

circumstances, such death was within a period of seven

years of her marriage and that there was cruelty and

harassment in connection with demand for dowry before

her death. That being so, whether remaining of as a passive

spectator by husband while harassment or cruelty was

inflicted by a relative on the wife would inculpate the

BA 3099/2013                    4

husband also from such an offence is something to be

decided on the materials tendered in the case, if at all any

indictment is made against petitioners in the case. The

victim has not made specific imputation against the

husband when she gave a statement to police in the given

facts of the case cannot be given unmerited consideration

ignoring other facts and circumstances involved in the case.

I find this is not a fit case where petitioners can be granted

the relief of pre-arrest bail, especially where materials

gathered by investigating agency, as rightly contended by

Public Prosecutor, give enough room to suspect their

complicity in the grave offence imputed. Petitioners have to

surrender and co-operate with the investigation of the

crime.

       6. At this stage learned counsel for petitioners

requested for providing an opportunity to them to surrender

before investigating officer, fixing date and time to do so by

an order of this court.

       7. Considering the request made, the following

BA 3099/2013                   5

directions are issued while declining anticipatory bail to

petitioners:

              In  case   petitioners  surrender   before

       investigating officer at 10 a.m. on 15-7-2013,

       after their interrogation and in the event of their

       arrest, they shall be produced before magistrate

       of competent jurisdiction without delay. On such

       production, subject to orders on application, if

       any, moved by investigating officer for their

       further interrogation and custody, application for

       bail, if any, moved by petitioners with advance

       notice to Assistant Public Prosecutor also, shall

       be considered by magistrate expeditiously and

       disposed on its merits in accordance with law.


                               S. S. SATHEESACHANDRAN,
                               JUDGE.

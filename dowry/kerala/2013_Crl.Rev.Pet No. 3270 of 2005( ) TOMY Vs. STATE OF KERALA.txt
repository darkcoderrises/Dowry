                   Crl.R.P. No. 3270 of 2005
                        --------------------------
             Dated this the 17th December, 2013

                               O R D E R


      The revision petitioners are the accused in C.C No.49

of 2002 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,

Thodupuzha. They were prosecuted for                the offence

punishable under Sections 465, 471 read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as 'IPC' for short)

and after trial they were convicted for the offence

punishable under Section 465 read with Section 34 of IPC

only.     They     were     sentenced      to    undergo  simple

imprisonment for one year each.

      2.   Feeling      aggrieved,      though     the   revision

petitioners had preferred Crl.A No.355 of 2004 before the

Additional   Sessions    Judge/Special       Judge    for  NDPS

Cases,Thodupuzha, after the appreciation of evidence, the

learned Sessions Judge also confirmed the conviction and

sentence imposed on them and dismissed the appeal. This

revision petition is filed challenging the said conviction and

sentence.

                                    2


       3.     Though this revision petition has been filed

assailing the findings of guilty and conviction thereunder, on

various grounds now the revision petitioners have filed a

petition to implead the defacto complainants as additional

respondents and the same has been allowed vide order

dated 17.12.2013 in Crl.M.A No.8849 of 2013.

       4.     The offence under Section 465 is a non-

compoundable offence.         So the learned counsel for the

revision petitioners filed Crl.M.A No.8848 of 2013 along with

affidavits sworn in by the additional respondents          2 to 5

under Section 320 read with Section 482 of IPC seeking

permission to compound the non-compoundable offence

also. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners cited

Gian Singh V. State of Punjab.[2012 (4) KLT 108] and

draw my attention to paragraph 57 of the above decision.

               "    The position that   emerges from the
        above discussion can be summarised thus: The
        power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
        proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
        inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
        the    power     given to  a   criminal   court   for
        compounding the offences under S.320 of the
        Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
        statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
        accordance with the guideline engrafted in such

Crl.R.P. No. 3270 of 2005
                                    3


        power viz; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
        to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
        what     cases   power   to   quash  the   criminal
        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R          may be
        exercised where the offender and victim have
        settled their dispute would depend on the facts
        and circumstances of each case and no category
        can be prescribed. However, before exercise of
        such power, the High Court must have           due
        regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
        Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity
        or offences like murder, rape, dacoity etc., cannot
        be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
        victim's family and the offender have settled the
        dispute. Such offences are not private in nature
        and have serious impact on society.      Similarly,
        any compromise between the victim and offender
        in relation to the offences under special statutes
        like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
        committed by public servants while working in
        that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
        quashing criminal proceedings involving such
        offences.       But  the   criminal cases    having
        overwhelmingly and predominantly civil flavour
        stand on different footing for the purposes of
        quashing, particularly the offences arising from
        commercial,       financial,   mercantile,    civil,
        partnership or such like transactions or the
        offences arising out of matrimony relating to
        dowry etc or the family disputes where the wrong
        is basically private or personal in nature and the
        parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
        category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
        proceedings if in its view, because of the
        compromise between the offender and victim, the
        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
        continuation of criminal case would put accused
        to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
        injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
        the criminal case despite full and complete

Crl.R.P. No. 3270 of 2005
                                    4


        settlement and compromise with the victim. In
        other words, the High Court must consider
        whether it would be unfair or      contrary to the
        interest of justice to continue with the criminal
        proceeding or continuation of         the criminal
        proceeding      would  tantamount    to abuse    of
        process      of  law   despite   settlement    and
        compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
        and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
        appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
        and if the answer to the above question (s) is in
        affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
        jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

       5.     Going by the above decision, it is seen that the

Apex Court has considered the question whether a non-

compoundable         offence can   be   compounded     invoking

jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. The Supreme Court has categorised certain non-

compoundable         offence as   noncompoundable      even  in

exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. The offence involved in this case does

not find a place in the said category of offence. Therefore, I

am of the opinion that,        having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case, the jurisdiction under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be exercised to

compound the          non-compoundable offence under Section

Crl.R.P. No. 3270 of 2005
                                     5


465 in this revision petition.

       Consequently, the offence under Section 465 read with

34 of Indian Penal Code will stand compounded in exercise

of the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure and the sentence imposed on the revision

petitioner is set aside. The composition shall have the effect

of the acquittal of the accused under Section 320 (8) of the

Cr.P.C.

       This revision petition is allowed.

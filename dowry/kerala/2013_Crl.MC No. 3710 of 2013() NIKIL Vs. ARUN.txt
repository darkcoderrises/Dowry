          ----------------------------------------
          Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
          ----------------------------------------
        Dated this the 2nd day of September, 2013

                           ORDER

        As the above two cases are arouse out of case and

counter case and the parties in both the M.Cs are more or less

same and especially when the above dispute are settled, the

above two M.C are heard together and being disposed by this

common order.

        2.  Crl.M.C.No.3711/2013 is preferred against Crime

No.2676/2012 of Mathilakam Police Station, at the instance of

the accused therein which is a crime registered at the instance

of the first respondent, who is the defacto complainant

whereas Crl.M.C.No.3710/2013 is directed against Crime

No.2677/2012 of Mathilakam Police Station, which is the

counter case registered against Crime No.2676/2012 of very

same Police Station and the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the above

crime are the petitioners herein. The first respondent is the

defacto complainant and other is injured and thus respondents

No.1 and 2 are the accused in Crime No. 2676/2012. Thus

connected with an incident taken place at about 18.25 hours

on 12/12/12 there are two different versions and thus

registered two    crimes  that    Crime  Nos.2676/2012     and

Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
                                  2

2677/2012 of Mathilakam Police Station in both the cases the

prosecution witnesses sustained injuries. Now, the case of the

petitioners in the above cases are that as they are residing in

the same locality the entire dispute is settled and the

petitioners do not want to prosecute each other. In

Crl.M.C.No.3711/2013, the defacto complainant and the

injured in Crime No.2676/2012 are respectively sworn into

Annexures-1 to 3 affidavit and Annexure-4 is the joint

statement signed by the parties to the dispute and counter

signed     by    their    respective counsels.  Similarly    in

Crl.M.C.No.3710/2013 the defacto complainant and the other

injured who are respondents No.1 and 2, respectively sworn

into Annexure-3 series of affidavit and also Annexure-4 joint

statement signed by the both the disputed parties and counter

signed by their respective counsels.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crimes, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
                                 3

the subject matter of the above crimes. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crimes are abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, does not intend to

proceed any further against the petitioners and they have no

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petitions.       In the

given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petitions.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in these cases, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above cases are only Sections 341, 323, 324,

308 and r/w Section 34 of IPC., which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved.     It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
                                    4

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the respondents, it appears to me that the the

de facto complainants have no further grievance against the

petitioners accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In which case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                "57.  The position that emerges from the

         above discussion can be summarised thus:          the

         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

         the power given to a criminal court for compounding

         the offences under S.320 of the Code.        Inherent

         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

         the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

         the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

         may be exercised where the offender and victim

         have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

         and circumstances of each case and no category can

         be prescribed..

Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
                                      5

It is further held as follows:-


          ".........  But    the   criminal    cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite          full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present cases and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present cases, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present cases.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

Crl.M.C. Nos. 3710 & 3711 of 2013
                                 6

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.'s can

be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, these Crl.M.Cs are allowed, quashing in

Crime Nos. 2677/2012 & 2676/2013 of Mathilakam Police

Station and all further proceedings thereto.

                   ----------------------------------------
                     CRL.M.C.No. 3932 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 10th day of September, 2013

                                O R D E R

           The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.419 of 2008

of the Kilikolloor Police Station and according to him, the entire

dispute after the incident in the above case has been settled with the

de facto complainant and besides the above, according to him, though

the other accused faced the trial, they are acquitted as per Annexure 4

judgment. So, according to the petitioner, in the above circumstances,

no purpose will be served even if he is willing to face the trial.

Hence, the present petition is filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR and Annexure 2 final report in

Crime No.419/2008 of Kilikolloor Police Station and all further

proceedings pending against him pursuant to the same                 in

S.C.No.454/2013 on the file of the court of Additional Districts and

Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II), Kollam.

Crl.M.C.No. 3932 Of 2013

                                :-2-:

      2.   The prosecution case is that due to previous enmity on

18.8.2008 at 7.15 a.m. accused abused CW1 and the first accused

inflicted injury upon his head with a sword and A2 attempted to

commit his murder by inflicting injuries. The place of occurrence is

on the eastern side of the public road near Kalakulam temple. The

attempt of the accused was to commit his muder. Accused were

allegedly acting in prosecution of their common intention CW1 gave a

statement before the Police and on the basis of that CW9 registered

Crime No.419/2008 conducted the investigation and laid the charge

before the court. Thus, according to the prosecution, the accused has

committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 324 and

308 read with Section 34 I.P.C.

      3. Now, the case of the petitioner is that as I indicated earlier,

after the incident, the entire dispute is settled with the second

respondent, who is the de facto complainant and he had sworn into

Crl.M.C.No. 3932 Of 2013

                                :-3-:

Annexure 5 affidavit. In the light of the submission made by counsel

for the petitioner, I have also perused Annexue 4 judgment and in

paragraph 6 of the same, the learned Sessions Judge has found that

Pws.2 to 5, who are the occurrence witnesses, did not support the

prosecution case and they turned hostile and thus, the remaining

witnesses were given up by the prosecution and consequently, those

accused are acquitted.

      4. In the light of the above facts and circumstances, according

to me, particularly in view of the settlement arrived between the

petitioner and the de facto complainant, it is only just and proper to

allow this Crl.M.C., otherwise, no purpose will be served except the

sheer waste of judicial time. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No. 3932 Of 2013

                                             :-4-:

                    "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
          commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
          its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
          case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case
          despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
          victim........"


Thus, according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Crl.M.C.can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

               In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed quashing Annexure I

Crl.M.C.No. 3932 Of 2013

                                 :-5-:

FIR and Annexure 2 final report in Crime No.419/2008 of Kilikolloor

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against him

pursuant to the same including S.C.No.454/2013 on the file of the

court of Additional District and Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II), Kollam.

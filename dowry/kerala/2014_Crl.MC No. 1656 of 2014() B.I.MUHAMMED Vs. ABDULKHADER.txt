     ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1656 of 2014
     ==============================
         Dated this, the 25th day of March, 2014.


                            O R D E R



      This is an application filed by the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

C.C.No.1842/12 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-1, Kasargod, to quash the proceedings on the basis

of the settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No.1842/12 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-1, Kasargod. The case

has been registered on the basis of the statement given by the

first respondent against the petitioners as Crime No.400/12 of

Kasargod Police Station alleging offences under Sections 323,

324, 294(b) read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Now,

the matter has been settled between the parties and there was

a counter case also in respect of the same incident as

C.C.No.1843/12 and that was quashed by this court as per

order in Crl.M.C.No.656/14. In view of the settlement, there is

no possibility of any conviction and proceeding with the case

will only amount to waste of judicial time. Since some of the

Crl.M.C.No. 1656 of 2014       : 2 :

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they cannot file an

application for compounding before the court below. So, they

have no other option except to approach this court seeking the

following relief:

            "To quash Annexure A-1 Final Report and all further

     proceedings in C.C.No.1842/2012 of J.F.M.C.-I, Kasargod

     (Crime No.400/2012 of Kasargod police Station) as

     against the petitioner/accused person in this petition, in

     the interest of justice. "

      3.     First respondent appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and he has no

objection in quashing the proceedings.         The counter case

against him has been settled and quashed by this court. He

had also filed an affidavit stating these facts. The Counsel for

the petitioners also submitted that, in view of the settlement,

there is no possibility of any conviction. So, he prayed for

allowing the application.

      4.     The Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that there is no other case

except this case against the petitioners and they have no

criminal background but opposed the application for quashing.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

Crl.M.C.No. 1656 of 2014    :  3 :

statement given by the first respondent as de facto

complainant, a case was registered as Crime No.400/2012      of

Kasargod Police Station against the petitioners alleging

offences under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) read with Section 34

of Indian Penal Code. The matter has been settled between

the parties. It is also an admitted fact that there was another

case in respect of the same incident registered as Crime

No.401/12 of same Police Station on the basis of the

statement given by the first petitioner herein against the first

respondent and that was also taken on file as C.C.No.1843/12

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-1,

Kasargod and that case was quashed by this court as per order

in Crl.M.C.No.656/14 dated 20.01.2014.        The copy of that

order was produced by the Counsel for the petitioners for

perusal of this court at the time of hearing.

      6.     In this case also after investigation, Annexure A1

final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.1842/12 and pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-1, Kasargod. Considering the fact that

the matter has been settled between the parties, there is no

possibility of any conviction being entered against petitioners

Crl.M.C.No. 1656 of 2014          :   4 :

even if the case is allowed to proceed with. Now, the harmony

has been restored between the parties on account of the

settlement due to the intervention of the mediators. It cannot

be said to be a case of public interest affecting the society as

the case and counter case has been registered on account of a

private dispute between the parties which resulted in the

commission of the offences.

      7.      Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
     the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
     offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
     plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
     in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
     secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
     process of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the
     criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
     where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
     depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
     category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
     power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
     gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
     depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
     be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
     and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
     not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
     Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
     relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
     Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
     while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis
     for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But
     the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

Crl.M.C.No. 1656 of 2014           :   5 :

     civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
     quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
     financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions
     or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc;
     or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
     personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire
     dispute.   In this category of case, High Court may quash
     criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
     between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
     remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
     accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
     injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
     case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with
     the victim.    In other words, the High Court must consider
     whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice
     to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the
     criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
     law despite settlement and compromise between the victim
     and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
     appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer to
     the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
     well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



       8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has been

settled and harmony has been restored between the

petitioners and the first respondent due to the intervention of

mediators and the possibility of conviction is remote in view of

the settlement, this court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure has to

be invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the

settlement arrived at between the parties and the restoration

of harmony among them.

          So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

Crl.M.C.No. 1656 of 2014    : 6 :

C.C.No.1842/12 (Crime No.400/12 of Kasargod Police Station)

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-1,

Kasargod as against the petitioners is hereby quashed. Office

is directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

immediately.

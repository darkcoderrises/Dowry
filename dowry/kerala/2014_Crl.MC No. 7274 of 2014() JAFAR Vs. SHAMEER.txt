                   Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014
                 ---------------------------------
          Dated this the 19th day of December, 2014.

                            O R D E R


     The petitioners herein are the accused in the impugned

Crime No.181/2009 of Melattoor Police Station registered for

offences alleged under Secs.341, 323, 308 r/w 34 IPC. The

police after investigation submitted impugned Annexure-A1

Final  Report/Charge     Sheet    in   the   above  said Crime

No.181/2009 of Melattoor Police Station which led to the

pendency of S.C.No.483/2013 on the file of the Additional

Sessions Court-II, Manjeri. The brief of he prosecution case is

that on 27.9.2009 at about 8:30 p.m. in the night, while the

defacto complainant was standing on the roadside, the 1st

accused with the knowledge that it would cause death of

defacto complainant, hit on the head with a wooden stick and

when dodged, the stick hit on the lip, the 2nd accused hit on

the back and other parts of CW2 using and causing injury and

thereby accused have committed the offences under Secs.

341, 323, 308 r/w 34 IPC. It is submitted that now due to

mediation by well wishers of the locality and relatives, the

entire disputes between the petitioners and respondents 1 & 2

                               ::2::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

(defacto complainants/injured) have been settled. The defacto

complainants/injured have been impleaded as respondents 1 &

2 herein. Respondents 1 & 2 herein have sworn to separate

affidavits dated 1.9.2014 produced as Annexures B & C

respectively in this Crl.M.C wherein they have stated that due

to mediation of well wishers of the locality and relatives, the

entire disputes between the petitioners and respondents 1 & 2

have been settled and that they have no subsisting grievance

against the petitioners and they have no objection in the

quashment     of   the   impugned    criminal  proceedings    in

S.C.No.483/2013 pending before the Additional Sessions

Court-II, Manjeri. It is further stated that the case arose out

of personal disputes between the parties and that as the

matter has been settled they do not wish to continue the

prosecution of the impugned criminal proceedings and that

impugned Annexure-A Final Report and all further proceedings

in S.C.No.483/2013 on the file of the Additional Sessions

Court-II, Manjeri may be quashed in the interest of justice. It

is in the background of these facts and circumstances the

petitioners have filed the instant Crl.M.C invoking the inherent

powers conferred on this Court under Sec. 482 Cr.P.C with the

                               ::3::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

prayer to quash the impugned Annexure-A Final Report/Charge

filed in Crime No.181/2009 of Melattoor Police Station which

led to the pendency of S.C.No.483/2013 on the file of the

Additional   Sessions    Court-II,   Manjeri   and   all   further

proceedings arising therefrom.

      2.   The Crl.M.C has been admitted and Sri.P.M.Rafiq,

Advocate, has taken notice for the respondent Nos.1 & 2 and

the learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 3rd

respondent-State of Kerala.

      3.   Heard     Sri.V.A.Johnson    Varikkappillil,   learned

counsel appearing for the petitioners, Sri.P.M.Rafiq, learned

counsel appearing for the respondent Nos.1 & 2 and the

learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 3rd respondent.

      4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners has

submitted that during the pendency of the aforementioned

criminal proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably

between the parties, and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the controversy

have arrived at an amicable settlement and any further

continuation of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer

                                ::4::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

wastage of time and money and would unnecessarily strain the

judicial, administrative and financial resources of the State.

      5.   Sri.P.M.Rafiq,   learned     counsel  appearing    for

respondent Nos.1 & 2 has submitted on the basis of the

specific instructions furnished by the respondent Nos.1 & 2

that respondent Nos.1 & 2 have amicably settled the disputes

with the petitioners and that they have no objection in the

quashment of the impugned criminal proceedings and that the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners as they have no grievance

against    them    and    that    they   will  not    raise   any

dispute/complaint in future if the prayer for quashing the

impugned final report is allowed.

      6.   The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard and

submitted that this Court may consider the prayer in this case

in the light of the law well settled by the Apex Court in that

regard.

      7.   After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

                               ::5::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

nature. The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such

offences are involved, the real disputants to the controversy,

which has led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have

actually arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From

the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondent

Nos.1    &   2,   it  is   clear    to   the   Court   that   the

injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived at by them.     It is further stated that the injuries

allegedly sustained to the respondents 1 & 2 are simple in

nature and would not attract the offence under Sec. 308 IPC.

The wound certificate of the 1st respondent issued by the

Government Medical Officer concerned has been produced as

Annexure-D and the wound certificate of the 2nd respondent

issued by the Government Medical Officer has been produced

as Annexure-E etc. Annexure-D & E show that the injuries

referred to therein are not serious in nature.

      8.   In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision

of the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

                                     ::6::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

               "61.   The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
      power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
      abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
      quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
      dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
      case and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
       the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
       from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
       such like transactions or the offences arising out of
       matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
       category    of   cases,  High   Court  may   quash   criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
       criminal case despite full and complete settlement and
       compromise with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others

v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8)

Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC),

the Apex Court has held as follows:

               "When the High Court is convinced that the offences
       are entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect

                                   ::7::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

      public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of
      such proceedings on account of compromise would bring
      about peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not
      hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 r/w

Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

      9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

                               ::8::

Crl.M.C.No.7274 Of 2014

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

      In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed and the impugned

Annexure-A Final Report-Charge Sheet filed in impugned Crime

No.181/2009 of Melattoor Police Station which led to the

pendency of S.C.No.483/2013 on the file of the Additional

Sessions Court-II, Manjeri and all further proceedings arising

therefrom stand quashed.         The petitioners shall produce

certified copies of this order before Station House Officer

concerned as well as before the court below concerned.




                                         ALEXANDER THOMAS,
                                                  Judge.

                 Crl.M.C. No. 1216 of 2014
           ------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 14th day of February, 2014


                          O R D E R

     The petitioner is the accused in Sessions Case

No.1098/2011, which is now pending before the Assistant

Sessions Court, Cherthala. Offences alleged against him are

under sections 498A and 306 of IPC.

     2.  The deceased, who is the wife of the accused,

committed suicide by setting herself ablaze after pouring

kerosene on her body. According to the prosecution, the

accused subjected the deceased to physical and mental

cruelty and because of the unbearable treatment she

committed suicide.

     3.  The learned counsel for the petitioner refers to the

dying declaration in support of his submission that she has

stated that no unlawful demand for dowry was made by the

accused. What happened on that particular day was stated

Crl.M.C. No.1216/2014
                              -2-



by the deceased. It was also stated that the accused used

to consume liquor and quarrel with her. It is argued that,

apart from that treatment, there is nothing to indicate that

she was subjected to cruelty and there was no willful

conduct which would, in the normal course, drive the

woman to commit suicide.

      4.    Since the matter is pending before the Assistant

Sessions Judge, Cherthala, that court has to dispose of the

matter in accordance with law. If charges are not already

framed, the petitioner can apply for discharge also.

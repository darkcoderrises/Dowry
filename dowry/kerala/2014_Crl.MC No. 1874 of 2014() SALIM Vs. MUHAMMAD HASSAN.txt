               ----------------------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
               ---------------------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 1st April, 2014

                            O R D E R

     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 to 5 in

C.C. No. 133/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Mannarkkad to quash the proceedings in

view of the settlement under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 to 5 in C.C. 133/2013 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Mannarkkad.                  The

case was originally registered on the basis of the statement

given by the first respondent herein as Crime No. 501/2012

of     Nattukal     Police Station alleging offences under

Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 452 and 392 read with

Section 149      of the Indian Penal Code.                 Later after

investigation final report was filed against the                 present

petitioners alone alleging offences under Sections                 143,

Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
                                2

147, 148, 452, 323 and 324 read with Section 149 of the

Indian Penal Code and         it was taken on file as C.C.

No.133/2013. The matter has been now settled between

the parties. No purpose will be served by proceeding with

the case in view of the settlement.      Since some of the

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

file an application before the court below.      So     the

petitioner has no other option except      to approach this

Court seeking the following reliefs:

              "To quash Annexure A1      and all further

              proceedings thereon in C.C. 133/2013 on

              the file of the Court of the Judicial

              Magistrate of First Class, Mannarkkad, as

              against the petitioners".

     3.     Respondents 1 and 2, who are the defacto

complainant/injured in the case appeared through counsel

and filed Annexure - A2 and A3 affidavits and submitted

that the matter has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of mediators      and they do not want to

 Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
                                  3

proceed with the prosecution. The counsel for the

petitioners also submitted that in view of the settlement, no

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this Court,        submitted that except this case

there is no other case against the petitioners and they have

no criminal background but opposed the application for

quashing.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given         by the first respondent Annexure - A1

first information report        was registered as Crime No.

501/2012 against         the three   named persons  and some

identifiable persons originally alleging offences under

Sections 143, 147, 148,m 323, 324, 452 and 392 read with

Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation

final report was filed alleging          against the  present

petitioners alone, alleging offences under Sections       143,

147, 148, 452 and 323 324 read with Section 149 IPC and

 Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
                                4

Section 392 of the Indian Penal Code was deleted. Now

the    matter     has    been settled  between   the  defacto

complainant and other        injured in the case  due to the

intervention of mediators. It is alleged in the affidavits

that now the relationship between the present petitioners

and respondents 1 and 2 have been restored on account of

the settlement and they do not want to proceed with the

investigation of the case.

      6.    Learned Public Prosecutor     also submitted that

except this case, there was no other case against the

petitioners and there is no criminal antecedents for them.

      7.    Considering the fact    that the matter has been

settled, there is no possibility     of   either the  defacto

complainant or his witnesses are likely to support the case

of the prosecution and even if the prosecution is allowed to

continue, the possibility of conviction is remote and it will

be a wastage of judicial time only.

Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
                                      5

     8.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion can
    be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
    criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
    inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
    given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
    S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
    statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
    guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of
    justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
    what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint
    or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have
    settled   their   dispute  would   depend    on   the  facts  and
    circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.
    However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
    have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
    Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
    like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed
    even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have
    settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
    have serious impact on society.       Similarly, any compromise
    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences
    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
    offences committed by public servants while working in that
    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
    proceedings involving such offences.      But the criminal cases
    having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
    on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
    the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
    partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out
    of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes
    where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
    the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
    of case, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
    view, because of the compromise between the offender and
    victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
    continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
    oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
    caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
    complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

Crl.M.C. No. 1874 of 2014-F
                                      6

    words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair
    or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
    and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
    whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
    criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
    question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
    its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


     9.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties due to the intervention of

mediators and harmony has been restored between them

and on account of settlement,                   they do not want to

prosecute      the case and          no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case and conviction in such case is

remote, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure

has to be        invoked to quash the proceedings.                 So the

application is allowed and            further     proceedings in C.C.

133/2013       (Crime No.501/12 of Nattukal Police Station)

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Mannarkkad as against the petitioners is quashed.

concerned Court immediately.

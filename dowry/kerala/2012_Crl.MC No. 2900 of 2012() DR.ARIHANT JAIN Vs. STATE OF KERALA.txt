                 Crl.M.C.No.2900 of 2012
        -------------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 11th day of December, 2012

                          O R D E R




        Petitioners     are    the    accused     in    a  crime

registered at Thripunithura Police Station          for offences

punishable  under   Sections     498-A    and   406   read  with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

        2.   Crime in the above case was registered on

the complaint of 2nd respondent, wife of 1st petitioner,

imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment against her

husband,  his   parents    and   brother,    demanding    dowry.

Pursuant to registration of the crime, spouses have

resolved  their    disputes     through    mediation     at  the

District Mediation Centre, Ernakulam, is the submission

of the counsel for petitioners, placing reliance on

Annexure-II,   a   copy    of   the    agreement     entered  in

mediation. Second respondent/complainant has also filed

Crl.M.C.No.2900 of 2012

                          :: 2 ::


an affidavit stating that the parties have settled all

disputes and she is not interested in prosecuting the

case  for  the  aforesaid   offences.     Counsel for  2nd

respondent also endorses that resolution of the disputes

has been arrived by the parties.        In the aforesaid

circumstances, quashing of Annexure I FIR and all further

proceedings are canvassed by the petitioners, exercising

inherent powers of this court.

        3.    Learned Public Prosecutor, after getting

instructions,  reports  that   2nd respondent  is  now  in

Chennai,  but  the   enquiries   conducted  revealed  that

parties have settled their disputes.    Learned counsel on

both sides also submit that a decree of divorce on mutual

consent has been passed by the competent family court.

        4.   Taking note of the circumstances canvassed

of, I find, continuation of the criminal proceedings

against the petitioners on the basis of Annexure I FIR is

not called for.    Settlement effected by spouses can be

Crl.M.C.No.2900 of 2012

                          :: 3 ::


taken note of and recognised since the crime has been

registered on account of matrimonial disputes.

        5.    Criminal  proceedings  against  petitioners

under Annexure I FIR and further proceedings thereof are

quashed exercising inherent powers of this court, under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

        Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.

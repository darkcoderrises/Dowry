                      V.K. MOHANAN, J.
           --------------------------------------------
           Crl. M.C. Nos. 4081 & 4084 of 2013
            ------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 12th day of September, 2013


                           ORDER

     As the above two cases are directed against the case and

counter case and the parties to the above crimes are same and

especially, when the dispute in the above two crimes are

settled, the above two Crl. M.C. are heard together and being

disposed by this common order.

     2.    Crl.M.C.No.4081 of 2013 is directed against Crime

No.201/1995 of Ernakulam Town North Police Station, wherein

the offences involved are under Sections 323, 324, 427 and 34

of IPC and in the above Crl.M.C., respondents 2 to 5 are

respectively the de facto complainant and injured. Similarly,

Crl.M.C.No.4084 of 2013 is directed against the case in Crime

No.203 of 1995 of Ernakulam Town North Police Station,

wherein also the offences involved are under Sections 279,

337, 324 r/w 34 of IPC. Respondents 12 and 13 in the above

Crl.M.C are the de facto complainant and the injured, who are

Crl. M.C. 4081 & 4084 of 2013

                                 2

also the petitioners 1 and 2 in the other Crl.M.C.

       3.    The above case and counter case are registered

connected with an occurrence occurred on 21.9.1995 and with

respect to the same incident, different versions are given.

However, as the disputes are settled amicably between the

parties, I am not proposed to deal with the prosecution

allegations in each cases.

       4.    In Crl.M.C. No.4081 of 2013, the second respondent is

the de facto complainant and respondents 3 to 5, who are the

injured are respectively sworn into annexures A2 to A5 affidavits

stating that they have no objection in quashing the proceedings

alleged against the petitioners therein, who are the accused in

C.C.No.122 of 2006 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam, which instituted a Crime

No.201/1995 of Ernakulam Town North Police Station. Similarly,

in Crl.M.C.No.4084 of 2013, the de facto complainant who is the

second respondent and the injured/3rd respondent are also sworn

into respectively Annexures 2 and 3 affidavits in the above case.

Crl. M.C. 4081 & 4084 of 2013

                                  3

       5.    So according to the petitioners in the above Crl. M.Cs,

none of them wanted to prosecute each other and they want to

drop the proceedings now pending against them.

       6.    I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.       I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexures-affidavits. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also

no objection in allowing the above petition.

       7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above

case are only Sections 279, 323, 337, 324 & 427 r/w 34 IPC,

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest

is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the petitioners, it appears to me that the

Crl. M.C. 4081 & 4084 of 2013

                                        4

injured/the victim/the de facto complainant has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the above

          discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

          High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is

          distinct and different from the power given to a

          criminal court for compounding the offences under

          S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude

          with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in

          accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;

          (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse

          of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim have

          settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

          circumstances of each case and no category can be

          prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly

Crl. M.C. 4081 & 4084 of 2013

                                       5

          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

          offences        arising        from         commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the

          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

          parties have resolved their entire dispute.      In this

          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

          between the offender and victim, the possibility of

          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

          criminal case would put accused to great oppression

          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

          and complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

Crl. M.C. 4081 & 4084 of 2013

                                  6

the dispute.     It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as

sought for.

          In the result, these Crl.M.Cs are allowed, quashing

Annexure A2 to A5 in Crl.M.C.No.4081 of 2013 and Annexures A2

and A3 in Crl.M.C.No.4084 of 2013 and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.126 of 2006 on the file

of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Ernakulam in Crime No.201 & 203 of 1995 of Ernakulam Town

North Police Station and all further proceedings thereto.

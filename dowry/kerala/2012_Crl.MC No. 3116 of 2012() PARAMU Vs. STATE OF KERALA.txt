               Crl.M.C. NO. 3116 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 08th day of October, 2012

                            ORDER


           Petitioners are two among the accused in a case

pending trial on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Kodungalloor. They are being prosecuted with another for

the offence under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and

Section 417 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

Petitioners are the parents of One Sumesh whose marriage

with one Sruthilaya was fixed and arranged by the families

on both sides. Engagement for such marriage also followed

with ring exchange. However two days before the marriage,

a notice was issued from the side of the bride demanding

compensation alleging that the bridegroom and his parents

raising unlawful demand of dowry had withdrawn from the

marriage. A complaint to the police followed which led to

registration of a crime for the offence under the Dowry

Crl.M.C. NO. 3116 of 2012        2



Prohibition Act, and after investigation indictment of the

petitioners and their son for offences stated supra.       The

above petition has been filed to quash the criminal

proceedings against the petitioners in the case invoking the

inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure, for short the 'Code'.

            2. I heard the learned counsel for petitioners and

also the learned Public Prosecutor.      Allegations imputed

against the petitioners and their son to proceed against them

for the offences imputed are baseless, unfounded and

absolutely false, is the submission of the counsel submitting

that they too have made arrangement for conducting the

marriage and also later a reception inviting close friends and

relatives.    A story of unlawful demand for dowry was

invented with the connivance of the marriage broker and it

has no basis at all, is the further submission of the counsel.

Adverting to the notice sent through advocate by the father

of the bride, it is contended that the allegations imputed

Crl.M.C. NO. 3116 of 2012        3



thereunder are bereft of any truth. This court in exercise of

its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code cannot be

called upon to examine the correctness of the allegations

imputed in an advocate notice nor over the materials

gathered by the investigating agency in a crime to test the

sustainability of a report indicting a person of an offence.

That section of the Code is primarily intended for passing of

orders by this court to give effect to the orders under the

Code or to prevent abuse of process of the Court or to secure

the ends of justice. Where a final report has been filed by the

police in a crime after investigation, assertion made by the

person proceeded against to assail the indictment levelled

banking upon one or other documents connected with the

crime would not be sufficient to hold that the prosecution

proceeded against him amounts to an abuse of process of

the court. Whatever defences available to the person

proceeded against, no doubt, can be canvassed by him

before the magistrate in the case. I find this is not a fit case

Crl.M.C. NO. 3116 of 2012         4



warranting invoking of the inherent powers of this court,

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is dismissed.

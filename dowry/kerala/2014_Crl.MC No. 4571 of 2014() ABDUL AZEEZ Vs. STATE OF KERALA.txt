                -------------------------------
        Dated this the 14th day of August, 2014.


                        O R D E R

      The petitioner herein is the 1st accused in Crime

No.190/11 of Melattur Police Station in which the offence

alleged against the accused, including the petitioner, is

under sections 498A and 406 r/w 34 of IPC.

     2. The case of the petitioner is that the other accused

in the above crime faced prosecution in C.C.No.534/11 and

by Annexure-II judgment, the learned Magistrate acquitted

them and therefore even if the petitioner faced the

prosecution, there would not be any fruitful prosecution

and hence it is prayed to quash all further proceedings

pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.153/14 pending

before the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-II,

Perinthalmanna.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

Crl.M.C.No.4571 of 2014
                               2

the learned Public Prosecutor.

      4. The prosecution case is that A1 married the de

facto complainant Jasna on 10.5.2008 as per Muslim

Religious Rites and Customs and thereafter they were

living together as man and wife and at that time, A1 to A4

in furtherance of their common intention, ill treated the de

facto complainant both physically and mentally demanding

more dowry and money, and also misappropriated 74

sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs.1,80,000/- given to the

de facto complainant by her parents at the time of

marriage.         Therefore, the accused alleged to have

committed the offences punishable under sections 498A

and 406 r/w 34 of IPC.

      5. In the light of the submission made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner, I have carefully perused

Annexure-II judgment. In paragraph 16 of Annexure-II, the

learned Magistrate, who had undertaken the trial against

the other accused in the very same crime, had made the

following observations and findings.

Crl.M.C.No.4571 of 2014
                                 3

            "As stated earlier, PW3 admitted that she was
            divorced by A1.      She has admitted that her
            second marriage is over and A1 was not married
            again. Suppressing all the material facts, PW3
            filed this complaint before the court and the same
            was forwarded to the Police for investigation. In
            the prosecution case the allegation is confined
            against A2 to 4 in Ext.P1 also, the allegation is
            not only against the husband but also her mother
            and brother and sister of A1. When PW1 was
            examined, he deposed that he had only hearsay
            evidence from PW3 regarding the ill treatment
            and harassment. PW2 has no information about
            the alleged harassment and ill treatment meted
            out by PW3. PW3 is the de facto complainant also
            confined her allegation against A2 to A4, except
            some minor allegation against A1."

Thus on the basis of the above findings, it can be seen that

the de facto complainant has no serious allegation against

the petitioner and all her allegations were against A2 to A4.

On the basis of the discussion undertaken by the learned

Magistrate, he had held that the prosecution has miserably

failed to prove the essential ingredients of offence

punishable under sections 498A and 406 r/w 34 of IPC.

From the above quoted portion of the judgment of the trial

court, it can be seen that substratum of the prosecution

allegation has been shattered.           Since the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.4571 of 2014
                                4

complainant        has  no  serious  allegation against    the

petitioner, according to me, even if the petitioner is

constrained to face the trial, nothing would be materialised

and there would not be any fruitful prosecution, rather the

net result would be sheer wastage of judicial time, which

shall be prevented by exercising the extraordinary

jurisdiction of this Court under section 482 of Cr.P.C.

      In the result, this M.C. is disposed of quashing all the

proceedings         pending   against   the    petitioner   in

C.C.No.153/14 of the court of Judicial First class

Magistrate-II, Perinthalmanna.

          CRL.M.C.No.3781    OF 2010
          ===========================

   Dated this the 14th day of September,2010

                     ORDER


    Petitioners  are  the  accused  and  second

respondent  the   de   facto   complainant   in

C.C.425/2009 on the file of Judicial First

Class  Magistrate's   Court-I,  Hosdurg   taken

cognizance for the offence under sections 498A

and 494 of Indian Penal Code on Annxure A1

final report submitted by the Sub Inspector of

Police, Rajapuram Police Station.   Prosecution

case is that first petitioner married second

respondent on 4.7.2002 and while they were

living as husband and wife   fifth petitioner,

the brother of the first petitioner misbehaved

with the second respondent and on 17.1.2009

first petitioner contracted a second marriage

and  when   the  second   respondent  had   got

information, she questioned the same and    the

Crl.M.C.3781/2010             2

petitioners       treated  her  with  cruelty  and  also

demanded       a   dowry  of  Rs.5  lakhs  and   thereby

committed the offences.         This petition is filed

under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

contending that the entire matrimonial disputes

were     settled     amicably  and  consequent  to   the

settlement, second respondent has no subsisting

grievance against the       petitioners and therefore it

is not in the interest of justice to continue the

prosecution.

      2.        Second  respondent appeared  through   a

counsel and filed an affidavit stating that the

entire matrimonial disputes were settled amicably

on the intervention of mediators.            The second

respondent and her husband are living together and

consequent to the settlement, she has no objection

to quash the proceedings and hence the case is to

be quashed.

      3.         Learned  counsel  appearing   for   the

petitioners, second respondent and learned Public

Prosecutor were heard.

Crl.M.C.3781/2010             3

      4.     Annexure A1 final report establishes that

learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the

matrimonial offences on the final report submitted

by the police.       The affidavit filed by the second

respondent establishes that         entire matrimonial

disputes were subsequently settled and           second

respondent       wife  is  now living with  the  first

petitioner husband.       As held by the Apex Court in

B.S.Joshi       and  others  v. State of  Haryana  and

another (2003) 4 SCC 675) when matrimonial disputes

are settled amicably, it is not in the interest of

justice to continue the prosecution and jeoparadise

the matrimonial life.

      In such circumstances, petition is allowed.

C.C.425/2009 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg is quashed.

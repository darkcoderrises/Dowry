                Bail Application No. 5366 of 2011

                      -------------------------------

                       DATED: 01-07-2011


                              O R D E R

      Petitioner who is the sole accused in C.C. No. 89 of 2009

on the file of the J.F.C.M.I, Mavelikkara, Alappuzha District, for

offences punishable under Sections 3,4 & 6 of the Dowry

Prohibition Act, seeks anticipatory bail.

      2.    Consequent on the non-appearance of the petitioner in

the above case,      non-bailable warrants of arrest are pending

against the petitioner.    Anticipatory bail cannot be granted to

nullify the process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

There is no reason why the petitioner should not surrender before

the Magistrate and seek regular bail. Accordingly, if the petitioner

surrenders before the Magistrate and files an application for

Bail A.No.5366 of 2011            -:2:-

regular bail within two weeks from today, the same shall be

considered and disposed of preferably on the same day on which it

is filed notwithstanding the pendency of non-bailable warrants of

arrest against the petitioner and also after considering the

explanation offered       by the petitioner for his previous non-

appearance.

       With the above observation this application is disposed of .

       Dated this the 1st day of July, 2011.



                                         V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE.

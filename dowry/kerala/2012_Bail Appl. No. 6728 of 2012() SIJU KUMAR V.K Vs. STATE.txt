              ---------------------------------------------
         Dated this the 25th day of September, 2012


                             O R D E R

     This is an application filed under Section 438 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure seeking anticipatory bail.

     2.    Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.1099/2012

of Thiruvalla Police Station who is alleged to have committed

offences punishable under Sections 506(i), 323, 498A r/w 34 of

IPC. Allegation against the petitioner is that he demanding more

dowry harassed and manhandled the defacto complainant. The

marriage between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

was solemnized on 24.5.2010. The complaint was lodged only on

1.8.2012. Materials placed before the court for perusal show

that the allegations are vague and general in nature.

     3.    Considering the nature of allegations and also the

fact that the custodial interrogation is not necessary, it is felt

that this is a fit case where extra ordinary jurisdiction of this

court under Section 438 of Cr.PC can be exercised in favour of

the petitioner.    Accordingly, this application is allowed as

follows :

     1) The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

B.A.No.6728/2012                     2


Officer on or before 1.10.2012, who after interrogation shall

produce the petitioner before the JFCM court concerned, which

court on application for bail being filed by the petitioner shall

release him on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.10,000/-

(Rupees Ten thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for

the like sum to the satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

       2) The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

sureties and the veracity of the tax receipts, before granting

bail.

       3) The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating

Officer for interrogation as and when required by him.

       4) The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper

with the evidence and influence or try to influence the

witnesses.

      5) If any of the condition is violated, the bail granted shall

stand cancelled and the JFCM concerned, of being satisfied of

the said fact, may take such proceedings as are available to him

in law.



                                             P.BHAVADASAN,
                                                    Judge.

                     Crl.M.C.No.1476 of 2014
                  ..................................................
             Dated this the 7th day of March, 2014.

                               O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioner, who is the

accused in C.C.No.37/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Nedumangad to quash the proceedings on

the basis of the settlement under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that                     on the basis of a

statement given by the second respondent, Annexure 1 crime

was registered as Crime No.67/2011 of Venjaramoodu police

station against the petitioner alleging the offence under Section

294 (b) and 324 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation,

Annexure -2 final report was filed and it was taken on file as

CC.No37/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Nedumangad and it is pending before that court. In the

meantime , matter has been settled between the petitioner and

the defacto complainant. No purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case. Since some of the offences are non

compoundable in nature, the petitioner cannot move the court

Crl.M.C.No.1476 of 2014                   2

below for compounding. So the petitioner has no other option

except to approach this Court seeking the following relief:



           For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of hearing,
           it is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
           to set aside Annexure-1 FIR and all further proceedings in
           C.C.No.37/2014 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate
           Court-I, Nedumangad, in the light of Annexure-2 affidavit, as the
           continuation of the proceedings, will be an abuse of process of
           law.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he has filed Annexure-2               affidavit and he has no objection

in quashing the proceedings. The counsel for the petitioner also

submitted that in view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served in proceeding with the case.

      4.  The      learned       Public      Prosecutor,         on     instructions,

submitted that except this case there are no other cases against

the petitioner and he has no other criminal background as well,

but opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a statement

given by the second             respondent           Annexure -1          crime was

registered and after investigation final report was filed and it

was taken on file as C.C.No.37/2014 and it is pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Nedumangad. The

Crl.M.C.No.1476 of 2014            3

matter has been settled between the parties and the defacto

complainant namely the second respondent has filed Annexure

-2 affidavit which will go to show that the matter has been

settled and the relationship has been restored and he does not

want to proceed with the prosecution.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
          different footing for the purposes of quashing,
          particularly   the    offences     arising     from
          commercial,     financial      mercantile,     civil,
          partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony relating to
          dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature
          and the parties have resolved their entire
          dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because of the compromise between the offender
          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
          and bleak and continuation of criminal case
          would put accused to great oppression and
          prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
          to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
          full and complete settlement and compromise
          with the victim. In other words, the High Court
          must consider whether it would be unfair or
          contrary to the interest of justice to continue
          with the criminal proceedings or continuation of
          the criminal proceedings would tantamount to
          abuse of process of law despite settlement and
          compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
          and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
          appropriate that criminal case is put to an end

Crl.M.C.No.1476 of 2014            4

          and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
          affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
          its   jurisdiction  to    quash    the    criminal
          proceeding."

      7. In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties

and considering the dictum laid in the decision reported above

and there is     no possibility of conviction being entered into

against the petitioner even if his case is allowed to proceed

with, this Court feels that this is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote the

harmony restored between the parties in view of the settlement.

So     the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.CNo.37/2014 (Crime No.67/2011 of             Venjaramoodu police

station) on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Nedumangad, against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed     to communicate        this order to the

concerned court for necessary further action.

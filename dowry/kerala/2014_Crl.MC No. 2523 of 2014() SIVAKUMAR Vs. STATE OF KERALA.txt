                  Crl.M.C.No.2523 of 2014
               ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                             ORDER

     The petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.537 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kollam alleging offence punishable under Section 498-A and

34 of IPC. It is submitted by the petitioners that now the

entire dispute with the second respondent has already been

settled and a petition for divorce on mutual consent has

already been filed before the concerned court under Section

13B of Hindu Marriage Act. The second respondent has also

sworn Annexure-B affidavit stating that the dispute between

the parties have already been settled and she does not have

any intention to prosecute the criminal case.

     2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel appearing for the second respondent and also

the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.No.2523 of 2014
                               2


      3.   In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108], the Apex Court held that criminal cases having

overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a

different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising

out of matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family

disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in

nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

these category of cases, High Court may quash criminal

proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise between

the offender and the victim, the possibility of a conviction is

remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

case despite full and complete settlement and compromise

with the victim. In other words, the High Court may consider

whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice

to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of

Crl.M.C.No.2523 of 2014
                               3


criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the

answer to the above question is in affirmative the High Court

shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

proceedings.

      4.   The allegation made against the petitioners is that

they have committed offence punishable under Section 498A

and 34 of IPC.         The 2nd respondent, who is the defacto

complainant in the aforesaid criminal case has already filed

Annexure-B affidavit before this Court stating that the entire

dispute between the parties have been settled and she does

not want to prosecute the criminal case which is the subject

matter in this Crl.M.C.

      5.   In such circumstances this is a fit case in which the

proceedings in C.C.No.537 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam arising out of Crime

No.477 of 2011 of Eravipuram Police Station can be quashed

Crl.M.C.No.2523 of 2014
                              4


by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

following the principle laid down by the Apex Court in Gian

Singh's case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed quashing the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.537 of

2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kollam.

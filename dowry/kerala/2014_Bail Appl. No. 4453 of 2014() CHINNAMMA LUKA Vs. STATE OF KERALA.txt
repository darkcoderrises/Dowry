                    Bail Application No.4453 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 25th day of June, 2014


                                     O R D E R



           This is an application filed by the 2nd accused in

in Crime No.144/2014 of Pulpally Police Station, Wayanad

District, for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

           2. The case of the prosecution in a nut shell was

that, on account of the abetment made by the accused

persons, who are the husband and in-law of the deceased,

the deceased committed suicide on 05.03.2014 at Abudhabi.

She was driven to commit suicide on account of the

harassment made by her for demanding dowry and thereby

they have committed the offence punishable under Section

304(B), 306, 406 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

           3.     The counsel for the petitioner submitted that,

the petitioner has not committed any offence and in fact the

B.A.No.4453 of 2014
                                2

alleged commission of suicide by the deceased happened in

Abudhabi and the petitioner is residing in India and there is

no nexus between the act committed by the deceased and

the petitioner. So none of the offences are attracted as

against the petitioner. She has been arrested on 09.06.2014

and she is in jail from that day onwards.

           4.     The application was opposed by the learned

Public Prosecutor on the ground that, investigation is not

over and other accused persons are yet to be arrested and

in fact she had abused her and asked her to go and die and

that prompted her to commit suicide.

           5.     Heard both sides and perused the case diary

files.

           6.     It is an admitted fact that, first accused

married the deceased and they were living as husband and

wife and the marriage was solemnised on 14.05.2007 and

the deceased was residing with the first accused at

Abudhabi, even at the time when the alleged commission of

incident/ suicide happened. The petitioner was residing in

B.A.No.4453 of 2014
                              3

India at that time. The only allegation against the petitioner

was that, she had directed her to go and die and that

prompted to her to commit suicide is the allegation made. I

am not at this stage going to the question, as to whether

those allegations are sufficient to attract the offence under

Section 306 or 304(B) of the Indian Penal Code at this

stage. Anticipatory bail application filed by the petitioner

was dismissed. Further the present case itself has been

registered on the basis of a private complaint filed by the

father of the deceased, which was forwarded to the police

under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Thereafter the case was registered and investigation is

going    on.    After dismissal  of  the   anticipatory   bail

application, the petitioner surrendered before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Sultan Bathery, on

09.06.2014 and she was remanded to custody and the bail

application filed by her before the court was dismissed.

She is aged 60 years old and her custody is not required

any more in connection with the investigation. The

B.A.No.4453 of 2014
                                 4

apprehension of the Public Prosecutor that, if bail is

granted, she is likely to interfere the investigation, can be

removed by imposing some stringent conditions. So the

application is allowed with following conditions:

     i.     The petitioner shall be released on bail on

     executing a bond for 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty

     thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the

     like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial

     First Class Magistrate Court-II, Sultan Bathery.

      ii.   The petitioner shall appear before the

      investigating      officer  for     the purpose of

      interrogation on the last Saturday of every

      month between 9.00 a.m and 10.00 a.m for a

      period of three months and thereafter appear

      before him for the purpose as and when

      required in writing to do so by the investigating

      officer, till the final report is filed.

      iii. The petitioner shall not intimidate or

      influence the witnesses.

B.A.No.4453 of 2014
                                5

      iv. Petitioner is directed to surrender her

      passport     before  the   Judicial   First   Class

      Magistrate Court-II, Sultan Bathery, within a

      week of her release and she is not having any

      passport file an affidavit to that effect before

      that court, before that time.

      v.      The petitioner shall not leave State of

      Kerala without getting prior permission either

      from the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II,

      Sultan Bathery, or from the court to which the

      case will committed for trial, till the disposal

      of the case.

           With the above conditions the application is

allowed.

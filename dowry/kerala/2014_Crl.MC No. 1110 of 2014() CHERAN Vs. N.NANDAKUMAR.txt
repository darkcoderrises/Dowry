                         Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 14th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

accused in Crime No.1139/2008 of Kollam East Police

Station, to quash the proceedings in view of the settlement

arrived at between the defacto-complainant and the

petitioners before the Hon'ble Supreme Court under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 5 in Crime No.1139/2008

of Kollam East Police Station, which was registered on the

basis of a complaint filed by the first respondent as defacto-

complainant. The investigation is still in progress. No final

report has been filed in this case.                           There were several

litigations between the petitioners and the first respondent

and all these disputes were settled before the Hon'ble

Supreme Court and a compromise was field before the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case pending before the

Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
                               2

Hon'ble Supreme Court as Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)

No.31293/2011 and other petitions. The disputes and the

cases pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court were

disposed of on the basis of the settlement, as per Annexure-

B Judgment. One of the condition in the settlement was

that, the defacto-complainant will withdraw all the cases

against the petitioner and he will co-operate with the

petitioners in quashing the proceedings before the High

Court. It is on that basis, that the present petition has been

filed to quash Annexure-A First Information Report,

registered against the petitioners and further proceedings

thereon, invoking the power under Section 482 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.

            3.    The first respondent appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled and

on the basis of the settlement, all the cases between the

parties were disposed of by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and

they have agreed to withdraw this prosecution as well, as

Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
                                 3

part of the settlement and they have no objection in

allowing the application.

            4.    The learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that, in this case, since they could not trace out the real

suspects, only an U.N. report has been filed before the

concerned court.

            5.    Heard both sides.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

complaint      given     by  the  first   respondent    /defacto-

complainant, Anenxure-A First Information Report was

registered as Crime No.1139/2008 under Section 120B,

465, 467, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code against the

present petitioners. Since the investigating officer could

not complete the investigation and they could not get

material to file final report, they filed a U.N. report before

the court. It is also seen from the documents produced that

as per Annexure-B, Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, that all the disputes between the parties have been

Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
                                  4

settled and the cases pending before the Hon'ble Supreme

Court were disposed of on the basis of the settlement. One

of the conditions mentioned in the settlement as condition

No. (vii) was that:

             "(vii) In view of the compromise herein, the
       respondent agree that they shall not object quashing of
       the FIR in Crime No.1139/08 of Kollam East Police
       Station registered against the petitioner and others, in
       appropriate criminal proceedings which the petitioner
       and others may from now institute before the Hon'ble
       High Court of Kerala."

The defacto-complainant will co-operate with the petitioners

by filing necessary application before the High Court to

quash the same. It is on that basis the present petition has

now filed.

            7.     The counsel for the first respondent also

submitted that, the entire matter has been settled due to

the intervention of the parties. There is no public interest

involved in the case, as it is purely a monitory transaction

between the petitioners and the first respondent. In the

decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
                                    5

(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held

that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
      for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
      arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences
      arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
      family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
      quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
      compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation     of the    criminal    proceedings   would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
      that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court
      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."

So in view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled as

evidenced by Annexure-B order of the Supreme Court, no

purpose will be served in continuing the case. So I feel that

Crl. M.C. No.1110 of 2014
                                  6

it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

'Code' has to be invoked to quash the proceedings. Hence

the application is allowed and further proceedings in

Annexure-A (Crime No.1139/2008 of Kollam East Police

Station), against the petitioners is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned

magistrate court to be informed to the concerned police

Station, for necessary further action in this regard.

                          Crl.M.C.No. 4770 of 2014
                      ----------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 21st day of August, 2014

                                   O R D E R

                     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused in C.C.No.1111/2012 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No. 83/2012 of Rajapuram Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 452,323,324 read with Section 34 of

I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all proceedings in C.C.No.1111/2012 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg as the matter is

settled out of court.

          2.    The allegation in the above case is that the accused had

attacked the de facto complainant and her husband and while trying to

block the assault, the de facto complainant got injured and the accused

have thus committed the offences punishable under Sections 452,323,324

read with 34 of I.P.C. and now, the case of the petitioners is that the

Crl.M.C.No.4770 of 2014


                                     :-2-:

matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.4770 of 2014


                                         :-3-:

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

452,323,324 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second respondent, it appears to me that the                      de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
         would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

Crl.M.C.No.4770 of 2014


                                          :-4-:

           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

                                     :-5-:

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.         Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all proceedings in

C.C.No.1111/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

I, Hosdurg and all further proceedings thereto.

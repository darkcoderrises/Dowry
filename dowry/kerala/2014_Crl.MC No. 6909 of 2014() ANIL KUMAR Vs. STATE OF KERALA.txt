on it in C.C.491/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Nedumangad, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel. The learned

CRL.M.C.No.6909 of 2014
                               -: 3 :-

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    Through a settlement the 1st petitioner and the 3rd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. Therefore, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

F.I.R. and Annexure A2 final report in Crime No.644/2013 of

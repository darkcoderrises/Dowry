                  .................................................
                        B.A.No.9017 of 2014
                 ..................................................
           Dated this the 26th day of December, 2014.

                                O R D E R


     This is an application filed by accused 1 and 2 in Crime

No.1658/2014 of Pandalam police station for anticipatory bail

under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the first

accused married the defacto complainant on 5.11.2006 and

thereafter they were living together as husband and wife and

while so,    she was ill treated by them demanding more

dowry and thereby all of them have committed the offence

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 of the

Indian penal Code.

     3. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they have

not committed any offence and they are innocent of the same

and they have been falsely implicated in the case. They further

submitted that they are prepared to abide by any condition

imposed by this Court.

     4. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor

on the ground that    investigation is still in progress.

B.A.No.9017 of 2014                2

       5. The case was registered originally by the Konni police

on the basis of the statement given by the defacto complainant,

the wife of the first petitioner, against the petitioners alleging

offence under section 498 A read with section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code as Crime No.1308/2014 of Konni police

station. During investigation it was revealed that the incident

occurred within the jurisdiction of Pandalam police station. So

it was transferred to that police station where it was re-

registered as Crime No.1658/2014 of Pandalam police station

under section 498 A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code. I am not at this stage        going into the question as to

whether the allegations are genuine or they are sufficient to

attract the offence or not.     The marriage was solemnised on

5.11.2006, but the complaint was filed only in the year 2014,

after 8 years of the solemnization of the marriage.      Sending

one of the spouses or relatives to jail in a matrimonial offence

will affect the prospects of settlement in future.        Further

considering the nature of allegations, custodial interrogation

of the petitioners is not required and this       Court feels that

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners with some

conditions. So the application is allowed as follows:

       i.     If the petitioners are arrested in connection with

Crime No.1658/2014 of Pandalam police station, they shall be

B.A.No.9017 of 2014                 3

released on bail on executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- each with

two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction

of the arresting officer/respondent/investigating officer as the

case may be.

ii.    The petitioners shall       appear before the investigating

officer     for the purpose of interrogation for two consecutive

days between 9 a.m and 11 a.m immediately after such arrest

and     release    and thereafter as and when required by the

investigating officer for this purpose in writing to do so till the

final report is filed.

iii. The petitioners    shall not intimidate       or  influence   the

witnesses.

iv.     The petitioners shall not leave State of Kerala without

getting prior permission from the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Adoor till the disposal of the case.

v.     If the petitioners surrender before the           Judicial First

Class Magistrate, Adoor and move            for  regular bail, then the

learned Magistrate is directed to release them on bail on the

same conditions as stated above.

       With the above conditions, the application is allowed.

                                                 Sd/-

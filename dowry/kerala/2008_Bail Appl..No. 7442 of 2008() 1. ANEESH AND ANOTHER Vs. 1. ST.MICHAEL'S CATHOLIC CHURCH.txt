                    Bail Appl.No. 7442 of 2008

                 ---------------------------------------------------

            Dated this the 15th day of December, 2008.


                                     ORDER

            Petition for anticipatory bail.

           2. The alleged offence is under Section 498(A) of IPC.

According to prosecution,           de facto complainant married first

accused    on 16.12.2007. Second accused is first accused's

daughter born in his former marriage. A3 is the second accused's

husband. A4 is the maternal first cousin of second accused.

They allegedly harassed the de facto complainant, physically and

mentally, by demanding more dowry,

      3.   Learned counsel for             petitioner        submitted that first

accused and de facto complainant were married on 16.12.2007

and he went abroad in the same month. Thereafter, he came

back in May 2008 and was in India and he left abroad in July

2008. He divorced the de facto complainant in October, 2008.

Thereafter, a complaint was filed before the Police on 15.11.2008

making false allegations.         It is submitted that it is only because

the marital relationship between first accused and de facto

complainant ended up in divorce that this complaint is falsely

lodged. Petitioners are not even residing with de facto

complainant and they reside in different places. Learned counsel

for  petitioners also submitted that 2nd accused is having two

children, aged 11 years and 3 months respectively                      and her

[B.A.No.7442/08]                   2

husband is working abroad, who is the 3rd accused in this case. A4

is only aged 18 years.

            4. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that only

general allegations are made           against second and fourth

petitioners that they are harassing de facto complainant.

            On hearing both sides, I am satisfied that anticipatory

bail can be granted to petitioners and the following order is

passed:

      Petitioners shall surrender before the Magistrate Court

      concerned within seven days from today          and they

      shall be released on bail on their executing bond for

      Rs.25,000/- each with two solvent sureties each for

      the like sum to the satisfaction of the learned

      Magistrate on the following conditions:

       i)    Petitioners shall report before the investigating

             officer as and when directed and co-operate

             with the investigation.

       ii) Petitioner shall not influence or intimidate any

             witness or commit any offence while on bail.

Petition is allowed.




                                            K. HEMA, JUDGE.

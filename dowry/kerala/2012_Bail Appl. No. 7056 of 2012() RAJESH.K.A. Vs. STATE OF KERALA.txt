           This petition is filed under Section 438 of Cr.PC.,

Crime No.2130/12         of Aluva East Police Station for having

committed the offences punishable under Sections 498A r/w

S.34 IPC. The allegation against them is that they mentally

and physically harassed the defacto complainant, demanding

more dowry. The petitioners submit that the above allegations

are totally false and cooked up only for the purpose of this

case. According to them, the crime has been registered on the

basis of a private complaint filed by the complainant. They also

point out that they have been falsely implicated with ulterior

motives. Therefore, they seek anticipatory bail.

           2. The learned Public prosecutor vehemently

opposed the application.

           3. After having heard the learned counsel for the

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor and going

jurisdiction of this court under Section 438 of Cr.PC.

Accordingly, this application is allowed as follows :

1. The petitioners shall surrender before the Investigating

   Officer on or before 05.10.2012, who, after interrogation,

   shall produce them before the JFCM concerned.

2. On applications being filed by the petitioners for bail before

   the JFCM concerned, they shall be released on bail on each

   of them executing a bond for Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen

   Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

   sum each to the satisfaction of the JFCM concerned.

3. The learned Magistrate shall ensure the identity of the

   sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts produced by

   the sureties before granting bail to the petitioners.

4. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer

   as and when required by him, till final report is filed.

5. The petitioners shall not tamper or attempt to tamper with the

   evidence and influence or try to influence the witnesses.

6. If any of the conditions is violated by any of the petitioners,

BA 7056/12                        3

  the bail granted in respect of the said petitioner shall stand

  cancelled and the JFCM concerned, on being satisfied of the

  said fact, may take such steps as are available to him in law.

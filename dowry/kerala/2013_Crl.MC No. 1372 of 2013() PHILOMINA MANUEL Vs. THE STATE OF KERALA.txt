                   Crl.M.C.No.1372 of 2013
                ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 3rd day of June, 2013

                             O R D E R

           The above M.C. is filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings pending against the petitioner in Annexures A1 to

A3 on the ground that the matter is settled between the contesting

respondents.

      2. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the counsel

appearing for the second respondent.           I have also heard the

learned Public Prosector.

      3.     The allegation against the petitioner is that the

petitioner along with other accused, who are the Directors of the

Venad kuries, failed to pay an amount of `1 lakh to the second

respondent, who is the de facto complainant even though the

period of kuries is over by 9.7.2000 and therefore, the second

respondent approached the court below by filing a private

Crl.M.C.No.1372 of 2013
                                :-2-:

complaint     alleging  offences     punishable     under    Sections

120b,403,406,420 and 34 I.P.C. against the respondent and other

accused.    On getting the complaint transmitted from the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur under Section 156(3) of the

Cr.P.C., Annexure A2 F.I.R. was registered in the East Police

Station, Thrissur and finally, after investigation, the police had

preferred Annexure A3 final report. Now the case of the petitioner

is that the offences alleged against the petitioner as per the final

report is only under Sections 120B, 403,406, 420 read with 34

I.P.C. and the case of the petitioner is that the dispute between the

petitioner and the second respondent is settled out of court and

accordingly, as per Annexure A5, the second respondent received

altogether a sum of `1,75,000/- from the petitioner. On behalf of

the second respondent, Annexure A4 statement is filed before this

Court,which is duly signed by the second respondent and counter

signed by Advocate Sri.M.H.Muhammed Basheer and the counsel

appearing for the respondent submitted that the second respondent

Crl.M.C.No.1372 of 2013
                                  :-3-:

has no further grievance against the petitioner.

            4. The Honourable Apex Court in the decision reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)]            has

held that it is within the powers of a High Court to quash criminal

proceedings, involving even non compoundable offences, on the

basis of compromise reached between the offender and the victim.

In the said decision, it is also held by the Apex Court that when the

criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing

particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,

mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transaction for the

offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. As the

parties to the dispute have settled the matter, especially when the

respondents have compensated, as evidenced by Annexure A5, I

am of the view that even if the trial is proceeded further, there is no

likelihood of any fruitful prosecution.        Thus, following the

decision referred to above, I am of the view that this petition can

Crl.M.C.No.1372 of 2013
                                :-4-:

be allowed quashing Annexures A1 to A3.

            In the result, this Criminal M.C. is disposed of setting

aside Annexures A1 to A3 and quashing all proceedings pending

against the petitioner in L.P.No.11 of 2012 which is instituted

pursuant to the report in Crime No.226 of 2002 of East Police

Station, Thrissur.

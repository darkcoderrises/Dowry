sentenced the appellant, who is the first accused,           to be

hanged by neck till he is dead for offence under Section 302

IPC. For offence under Section 498A IPC, the appellant was

sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years. The

death sentence was referred to this Court under Section 366

of the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation. The

The prosecution case in brief is that Abdul Khader Musaliar,

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -2-


the 2nd accused and son of the appellant Mammikutty

married Mymoona. PW-10 Muhammed and PW-11 Fathima

are the parents of Mymoona. The marriage was on 12-3-

2006. On the date of the marriage Mymoona was aged 26

years, whereas Abdul Khader Musaliar was aged only 23

years.      Mymoona was given ornaments weighing 30

sovereigns and a sum of Rs.1 lakh. The appellant, his wife

Nabeesa who was the third accused and Abdulkhader were

not satisfied with the quantity of the gold ornaments and

the amount given at the time of marriage.      Though the

appellant, his wife and son were aware on the date of the

marriage that Mymoona was older than Abdul Khader, later

relating to the age they picked quarrel and there was even

demand to have the date of birth of the deceased corrected

in the records. There was also demand for giving more

dowry.     Three months after the marriage Mymoona was

taken to her parents and asked for giving ornaments

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -3-


weighing    20 sovereigns more      and another sum of

Rs.50,000/-. When PW-10 declined to heed to the demand,

Abdul Khader went away leaving mymoona there and

stating that Talaq would be pronounced. But on the next

day Abdul Khader returned and took back Mymoona stating

that what he had stated on the previous day need not be

taken seriously and that he was taking Mymoona back

home.       Demand for more dowry and money was

subsequently repeated. PW-10 managed to give some house

hold articles. But the appellant, his wife and son were not

happy with it. During the holy month of Ramzan in 2007,

PW-10 invited the appellant and family members to join the

family for breaking the fast. But the appellant did not care

to go to PW-10 to join for breaking the fast. Mymoona was

also not sent. Out of the matrimony, a girl child was born

and she was aged 7 months as on October 2007. On 2-10-

2007 PW-10 telephoned to appellant and enquired why they

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                            -4-


had not gone home for breaking the fast.     The appellant

replied that PW-10 was not listening to their demands.

Hence they were not joining them to break the fast. The

appellant told PW-10 that on the next day he would know a

matter which the entire world would listen. According to the

prosecution, in between 8 and 8.30 a.m. on 3-10-2007 the

appellant inflicted severe cut injuries on Mymoona with

M.O.1 chopper, a very deadly weapon.          Knowing the

incident, PW-1, a neighbour and others rushed to the house

of the appellant. PW-1 saw the appellant standing at the

Verandah of the house with chopper in his hand. In an

adjacent cot Mymoona was lying with bleeding injuries on

her head, neck and hands. He along with one Hassan, who

is now no more, lifted the injured Mymoona to the Divine

Hospital, Wadakkanchery wherein PW-12 was the casualty

Medical Officer. PW-12, after examining Mymoona reported

brought dead. The matter was reported to the brother of

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                                -5-


Mymoona.       Hassan proceeded to the Cheruthuruthi Police

Station at 10.00 a.m. where PW-21 was the Sub Inspector

and gave Ext.P12 first information statement. PW-21, after

recording Ext. P12 registered a case as crime No. 526/07

against the appellant for offence under Section 302 IPC by

Ext.P12(a) first information report.       PW-21 sent express

message to PW-23, the then Deputy Superintendent of

Police, Kunnamkulam. PW-23 took over the investigation.

The matter was also reported to PW-19, the Executive

Magistrate and Additional Tahsildar, Thrissur. PW-19 went to

Divine Hospital, Wadakkanchery and at 1.00 p.m. he

prepared Ext.P1 inquest report wherein PW-3 is an attester.

PW-23 went to the spot of occurrence and prepared Ext.P5

scene mahazar wherein PW-7 is an attester. It is seen that the

thumb and index finger of the left hand of Mymoona were

severed    and were lying at the spot.     PW-20, the Asst. Sub

Inspector of Police seized the same after preparing Ext.P2 inquest

                             -6-

Ext.P5 scene mahazar collected blood samples through PW-

18, the Senior Instructor, Forensic Science      attached to

Police Academy. PW-23 proceeded with the investigation.

The appellant was kept under surveillance at Cheruthuruthy

Police   Station.     PW-23  arrested    the  appellant  and

interrogated. At the time of arrest the shirt worn by the

appellant was stained with blood.      It was seized on the

strength of Ext. P4 mahazar wherein PW-6 and PW-20 are

attesters.    The shirt was marked as M.O.5.      During the

course of interrogation the appellant stated that he had kept

the chopper over a wooden rack placed along the western

wall of the house. Dhoti worn by him was kept under the

same wooden rack and in the event he was taken home he

would take it and hand it over. Accordingly as led by the

appellant PW-23 went to the house of the appellant at 6

p.m. The appellant took out M.O.1 chopper kept over the

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09

it over to PW-23.      Blood stained dhoti kept under the

wooden rack was also taken out and handed it over to PW-

23. PW-23 seized the same after preparing Ext.P6 recovery

the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Wadakkancherry

along with Ext.P15 remand report.         Reporting correct

address of the appellant, Ext.P16 report was filed. PW-23

then got the photographs of the dead body taken by CW-23

who was not examined. M.O.9 series are the photographs.

investigation it was revealed that the son and wife of the

appellant had subjected Mymoona with cruelty with a view

to coerce her and her relatives to meet unlawful demand for

dowry. Therefore, they        were arrayed as A2 and A3

respectively for offence under Section 498A IPC read with

34 IPC. Ext.P22 report was submitted by PW-23 on 17-10-

2007 to that effect. Further investigation was taken over by

PW-22 who succeeded PW-23. PW-22 after completing the

investigation submitted a charge sheet for offences under

Section 302 IPC and Section 498A read with 34 IPC before

the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Wadakkanchery.

     3.    The     learned Magistrate   took  cognizance   as

C.P.113/08 and proceeded with. The presence of the second

and third accused could not be procured and hence the case

against second and third accused were split up and

separately proceeded.      Finding that the offences alleged

against the appellant are triable by a Court of Session, after

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -9-


complying with the requisite procedures, by order dated 1-

12-2008, the case against the appellant was committed to

the Court of Session, Thrissur. The appellant was in custody

ever since his arrest on 3-10-2007. The presence of the

appellant was procured by issuing production warrant.

Since the appellant was not defended by a counsel, a legal

aid counsel was appointed by the learned Sessions Judge to

defend the appellant. After hearing the prosecution and the

appellant charge for offence under Section 302 and 498A

read with 34 IPC was framed. When read over and explained

the appellant pleaded not guilty.   Hence he was sent for

trial.

      4. On the side of the prosecution, PWs. 1 to 23 were

examined and Exts.P1 to P22 were marked. Nine material

objects were exhibited and marked as M.Os. 1 to 9. After

                              -10-


Procedure. The appellant stated that he was employed as a

night watchman at Wadakkanchery and used to reach home

at about 9 a.m. and as usual when he reached home he

noticed that his daughter-in-law was lying over the cot with

bleeding injuries. Though he attempted to lift her, he could

not succeed. He cried for help. Gathered people told him

that daughter-in-law       was inflicted injuries by some

unknown person. At his request a vehicle was brought. By

the time he lost consciousness and came to sense only when

police arrested him. At the request of the police he handed

over a chopper.       But that was not with him. He was a

follower of Congress Party. PW-1 had political enimity and

he was falsely implicated. Thereafter, the appellant and the

prosecution were heard. On finding that the appellant was

not entitled to be acquitted under Section 232 Cr. P.C. he

was called upon to enter his defence.       But no defence

evidence was let in.      Thereafter, the appellant and the

expense of the State to prosecute the appeal. We heard

Sri.C.M.Nazer, learned Public Prosecutor as well as Advocate

Sri.Lean Jose.

months after the marriage, Abdul Khader took Mymoona to

the house of PW-10 and demanded 20 more sovereigns of

gold and Rs.50,000/- as further dowry. When declined to

heed the demand Abdul Khader informed athat he would

pronounce Talak.      Leaving Mymoona at the house, Abdul

Khader went away. On the next day he came back and told

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -16-

deposed that Mymoona was conceived, gave birth to a girl

child and that when she was taken home after confinement,

two more sovereigns of ornaments were given. During the

Ramzan month in 2007 the appellant and family members

were invited to the house of PW-10 to join for breaking the

know a matter which the whole world would listen.       The

further evidence of PW-11 is that Mymoona was older than

Abdul Khader and the appellant and family members were

         fifth metacarpal bone cut fractured underneath
         involving its full thickness.


Severed left thumb and index finger with its distal phalanx

missing were brought separately in a plastic cover.     The

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -20-


missing right index finger and tip of left index finger were

recovered later from the house and brought separately in a

plastic cover along with a request from the Sub Inspector of

Police, Cheruthuruthy Police Station. It was further opined

that death was due to injury sustained to neck. Injury No.1

was sufficient in the ordinary course to cause death and

that all the injuries noted in Ext.P7 could be caused by

cutting with M.O.1 chopper which was shown to PW-13 and

that injury No. 9 to 12 were defensive wounds while the

victim trying to ward off the cuts. In cross examination it

was deposed that M.O.1 is a sharp heavy weapon.

     17. PW-14, then Varavoor - Pilakkad Group Village

Officer, had deposed that Ext.P18 is a scene plan prepared

by him and that Ext.P9 is the certificate of possession

regarding 2.02 Ares of land in survey No.340/4 possessed

by the appellant. PW-15 had deposed that he was the

Headmaster of Government High School, Varavoor and that

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -21-


deceased Mymoona was a student in the School and that as

per the records, extract of which is marked as Ext.P10, date

of birth of Mymoona was 11-7-1980.

     18. PW-16 had deposed that he was Secretary of the

South    Thalassery Sunni Juma Ath     Committee and that

Ext.P10 is a certificate issued by him and that as per the

records maintained by the Sunni Juma Ath Committee, the

marriage of Mymoona was on 12-3-2006 and that at the

time of marriage Mymoona was aged 26 years and Abdul

Khader was aged 23 years.

     19. PW-17 is a woman constable who had been in

charge of the dead body. PW-18 is the Senior Instructor

(Forensic Science) attached to Police Academy.     She had

deposed that she had collected blood samples through a

cotton gauze and M.O.7 is the blood stained cotton gauze.

     20. PW-19 had deposed that he had prepared Ext.P1

inquest report and that at the time of preparing inquest he

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -22-


had seized M.O.2 maxi, M.O.3 underskirt and M.O.4

brassier. PW-20 is an attester to Ext. P4 seizure mahazar

whereby M.O.5 shirt worn by the appellant was seized by

PW-23. PW-21 had deposed about the recording of Ext. P12

first information statement and registering of the crime as

well as the preparation of Ext.P2 inquest report regarding

the two amputated fingers of the deceased.       PW-23 had

given evidence regarding the investigation.      PW-22 had

deposed that the investigation conducted by PW-23 was

completed and charge sheet was laid by him.

      21. PW-23 had also deposed that the appellant who

was under surveillance at Cheruthuruthy Police Station was

arrested at 4.15 p.m. on 3-10-2007 and that Ext.P14 series

are the arrest memos and that he seized M.O.5 shirt worn

by the appellant at the time of arrest and that Ext. P4 is the

mahazar prepared for the seizure of M.O.5. It was further

deposed that on interrogation the appellant stated that he

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                            -23-


had kept that chopper over the wooden rack placed along

the side of the western wall of the house and that the dhoti

worn by him was kept under the wooden rack and in the

event he was taken to the house he would take it and hand

it over to PW-23 and accordingly on the basis of the

information given by the appellant and as led by the

appellant he went to the house of the appellant and

recovered M.Os. 1 and 6. Ext.P6 is the recovery mahazar

and Ext. P6(a) is the disclosure statement given by the

appellant.

Evaluation of evidence

     22. The evidence of PW-1 would show that Mymoona

had sustained severe cut injuries and she was taken to

Divine Hospital, Wadakkanchery.     The evidence of PW-12

would show that Mymoona was brought dead with injuries.

The evidence of PW-13 coupled with Ext.P7 post-mortem

certificate and the evidence of PW-19 supported by P1

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -24-


inquest report would show that Mymoona had a homicidal

death. The cause of death deposed by PW-13 corroborated

by Ext.P7 was not at all challenged in cross examination. We

find no reasonto reject the above evidence.    On the above

evidence we find that the prosecution had succeeded to

establish that Mymoona had homicidal death and that the

evidence of the above witnesses were correctly appreciated

by the learned Sessions Judge. The finding of the learned

Sessions Judge on that aspect requires no interference.

     23. The question then remains is whether the appellant

can be implicated with the crime.      The very case of the

appellant, as has been stated earlier is that      when he

returned home from his watchman job he found Mymoona

with bleeding injuries. On the other hand, the evidence of

PW 2 would show that when they rushed to the house of the

appellant, the appellant was standing with a chopper in his

hand. PW-1 could not identify the chopper. PW-2 identified

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -25-


the chopper as M.O.1 and stated that M.O.1 was blood

stained. Mymoona was lying with bleeding injuries on a cot

at the front verandah of the house. The evidence of PW-9

would show that hearing the cry from the house of the

appellant, he rushed to the house and found that the

appellant was standing in front of the house with blood

stained shirt.       The learned counsel for the appellant

submitted that the blood stains found on the cloth might

have been sustained while the appellant attempting to lift

the injured as he stated. Going by Ext.P4 mahazar prepared

by PW-23 wherein PW-6 and PW-20 are attesters we notice

that M.O.5 shirt was stained with blood drops here and

there.     M.O.6 is the dhoti worn by the appellant and it was

seized on the strength of Ext.P6 mahazar by PW-23 wherein

PW-8 is an attester. A reading of Ext.P6 would show that

there were blood stains here and there. Blood stains noted

in Ext. P5 and P6 did not tally with the case of the appellant

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                               -26-


that he attempted to lift Mymoona with bleeding injuries.

In the event there was any attempt to lift Mymoona with

bleeding injuries there should have been wide spread blood

stains on dhoti and shirt instead of drops of blood here and

there. The nature of blood stains deposed by PW-23 and

noted in Exts.P4 and P6 is not challenged in cross

examination.       On a careful reading of Ext. P4 and P6 and

the defence case we find that the nature of blood stains

found over M.O.5 and M.O.6 is also not consistent with the

defence theory whereas it is consistent with the prosecution

case.

     24. The evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 that the appellant

was found standing in front of the house with M.O.1 was not

much impeached in cross examination.         The evidence of

PWs. 1 and 2 coupled with the evidence of PW-23 and

Ext.P6 and the evidence of PW-8 would show that M.O.1

was also stained with blood. The presence of the appellant

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                            -27-


near the victim soon after the occurrence       with   blood

stained M.O.1 supports the prosecution case. It is pertinent

to note that the appellant had no case that M.O.1 was not

belonging to him. The fact that he took M.O.1 from the top

of the wooden rack and handed it over to PW-23 was also

not much disputed by the appellant. Whereas he specifically

admitted that he had taken M.O.1 and handed it over to

PW-23.     The very case of the defence, as we mentioned

earlier is that someone else is the assailant. If that is so,

the appellant has no explanation as to how M.O.1 happened

to be over the wooden rack and how he was aware of the

presence of M.O.1 over the rack inside his house.        The

evidence of PWs. 1, 2 and 23 read with reference to Ext.P6

(a) statement as well as Ext.P6 we find that M.O.1 was

recovered on the basis of Ext.P6(a) information given by the

appellant.    The statement of the appellant leading to the

recovery of M.O.1 is admissible under Section 27 of the

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -28-


Evidence Act. That statement is consistent with the guilt

alleged and inconsistent with the plea of innocence.

     25. We also notice that PWs 1 and 2 had deposed that

the appellant, who was standing in front of the house with

blood stained chopper, went back to the house when the

public gathered. Every possibility for the appellant keeping

the weapon over the wooden rack is there. There is no

evidence either from the side of the prosecution or any

suggestion from the side of the defence that any other

person was available in the house at the time of occurrence.

There is also no materials brought out to establish that

during the intermittent time any third person had got access

to the house either to place a weapon over the wooden rack

from where the appellant took it and handed it over to the

investigating officer. The evidence of PW9 would show that

he reached the house of the appellant a little later. At that

time, the appellant was standing in front of the house

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -29-


without weapon but with blood stained shirts. The learned

counsel for the appellant argued that there is no whisper in

the evidence of PW9 that the appellant was having weapon

is his hand whereas PW 1 and 2 had deposed that the

appellant was standing in front of the house with chopper.

According to PW2, it was MO1 chopper and it was blood

stained. According to the learned counsel, PWs 1 and 2 are

to be disbelieved in the light of the evidence of PW9.

Having a careful scrutiny of the evidence of PWs 1, 2 and 9,

we are unable to accept the argument advanced by the

learned counsel for the appellant.    The evidence of PW9

would show that he was infact ailing but he reached the spot

hearing the cry. A comparative reading of evidence of PWs

1, 2 and 9 would show that PW9 had reached there after the

appellant keeping the weapon over the wooden rack. Since

PW9 came late, he couldn't see the appellant with MO1 in

his hands. So, for the reason that PW9 had not noticed

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                                -30-


weapon at the hands of the appellant, PWs 1 and 2 cannot

be disbelieved.

     26. The learned counsel further submitted that PW2

had deposed that the appellant had intimidated that nobody

should approach and in case approached, he would be

finished.    It is true that evidence of PW 23 would show that

such a statement was not given by PW2 to the investigating

officer.    In this view of the matter, it is a further

development in the evidence of PW2. But, we notice that the

accident occurred in a rural area. PW1 is a social worker

whereas PW2 is a JCB operator. What is his educational

standard is not at all disclosed. The power of observation,

retention and representation may vary from individual to

individual. In the event there is some minor omission in the

statement given to the investigating officer that itself may

not be a reason to reject the evidence of the witness in toto.

Sometimes, the witnesses may add some embellishments.

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                               -31-


There     may      be minor     omissions   or   additions   or

contradictions.     What is to be looked into in appreciation of

evidence is whether the witnesses were given false evidence

with any ulterior motive or whether the witnesses were

tutored by any external agency.        Having carefully gone

through the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 in cross-examination,

we notice that in fact there is no any such allegation of

motivation against the appellant.         There is no reason

suggested to PWs 1 and 2 to give false evidence against the

appellant. There is also no suggestion that PWs 1 and 2

were subjected to any tutoring by any person who has got

any axe to grind against the appellant. There is also no

case for the appellant that PWs 1 and 2 were on enimical

terms with the appellant so as to implicate the appellant

with a grave allegation like this. Though we find that there

are some minor embellishments and discrepancies in the

evidence of PWs 1 and         2 regarding intimidation by the

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -32-


appellant, that did not appear to be one of false implication

whereas it appears to be an embellishment involuntary

made by PW2. Probably, that might have been an omission

by PW2 at the time when the investigating officer recorded

the statement of the witnesses. For that reason, we find

that PWs 1 or 2 cannot be disbelieved.           On a critical

scrutiny, we find their evidence is quite natural and

convincing.

     27. Regarding appreciation of evidence of rural and

rustic witnesses, the Apex Court in Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade

v. State of Maharashtra po[AIR 1973 SC 2622] at paragraph

8 held as follows:-

           "The scene of murder is rural, the
           witnesses to the case are rustics and so
           their     behavioural    pattern    and
           perceptive habits have to be judged as
           such.        The    too    sophisticated
           approaches familiar in courts based on
           unreal    assumptions   about    human
           conduct cannot obviously be applied to
           those given to the lethargic ways of our
           villages. When scanning the evidence

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                               -33-


           of the various witnesses we have to
           inform ourselves that variances on the
           fringes,   discrepancies    in    details,
           contradictions    in    narrations   and
           embellishments in inessential parts
           cannot militate against the veracity of
           the core of the testimony provided
           there is the impress of truth and
           conformity    to   probability   in  the
           substantial    fabric    of    testimony
           delivered."

Applying th above principle to the testimony of PWs 1 and 2,

we find no reason to disbelieve them.

     28. The learned counsel for the appellant had

canvassed our attention to Ext.P5 scene mahazar and

argued that Ext.P5 was seen prepared at 4.p.m. and as per

Ext.P14 series the appellant was arrested by the very same

officer from      Cheruthuruthi police station   at 4.15 p.m.

which is 12 kms away from the spot of occurrence.

According to the learned counsel, the evidence of the

prosecution that scene mahazar was prepared at 4.p.m. is

an artificial one and hence the scene mahazar itself is to be

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                            -34-


rejected along with the evidence of PW23. We notice that

PW23     in his evidence in the witness box deposed that

Ext.P5 was prepared at 3.p.m. The evidence of PW23 on

that aspect was not challenged in cross-examination. We

also notice that there is some over-writing regarding the

time when Ext.P5 was prepared. But, we could read the

time as 3.p.m. Since the evidence of PW23 regarding the

time of preparation of Ext.P5 was not challenged in cross-

examination, we find that the over-writing regarding the

time of preparation of Ext.P5 is not at all a reason to reject

the scene mahazar.

     29. Alternatively,     it was argued by the learned

counsel for the appellant that in the light of Ext.P5 the

evidence of PW23 that he arrested the appellant at 4.15

p.m. is to be disbelieved. The evidence of PW23 that he

arrested the appellant at 4.15 p.m. was also not challenged

in cross-examination. Adding to the above the very evidence

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -35-


of PW23 is that the recovery following the disclosure of the

appellant was at 6.p.m. The time of recovery of      MOs 1

and 5 deposed by PW23 is corroborated by Ext.P6.

Regarding that also, there is no cross-examination. On a

critical scrutiny of evidence of PW23, Ext.P5 and P6 along

with Ext.P14 series, we find that the prosecution succeeded

to establish that the scene mahazar was prepared at 3.p.m.

and the appellant was arrested at 4.p.m. The recovery was

made at 6.p.m. Learned Sessions Judge correctly believed

the evidence of PW23 regarding the preparation of scene

mahazar and the recovery of MOs 1 and 6 on the strength of

Ext.P6. We find no merit in the argument advanced by the

learned counsel for the appellant regarding the non

admissibility of the scene mahazar, arrest and recovery of

MO1.

      30. Yet another argument that was made by the

learned counsel for the appellant is that column No.4 in

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -36-


Ext.P4 would show that one Hamza had given statement

during the time of inquest about the cause of death, but

Hamza was not examined. Though the entries in column

No.4 was not brought out in chief examination, we had gone

through the entries in      column No.4 of Ext.P4 to see

whether any such statement would enure to the appellant in

defence. On going by the entries in Column No.4 we are

unable to arrive at a conclusion that infact the Hamza had

mentioned about any direct knowledge regarding the

occurrence or that he was a witness as to how Mymoona

sustained injuries. In this view of the matter, we find no

reason to interfere with the findings of the Sessions Judge in

believing PWs 1, 2 and 9. Since the crime was committed

at the varanda of the house of the appellant and the

appellant alone was admittedly present in the house at that

time he has got a duty to explain as to how it occurred. To

avoid giving explanation he had stated that he was a night

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -37-


watchman and when returned home he found his daughter-

in-law lying with bleeding injuries. But the evidence of PWs

1 and 2 that the appellant was standing in front of the house

with blood stained MO1 stares against the defence

suggestion. Though it is revealed out that the appellant was

residing in the house along with his son and wife there is no

suggestion to PWs 1, 2 and 9 that when they reached the

spot of the occurrence either the son of the appellant or the

wife of the appellant was present there. It is very pertinent

to note that the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 did not suggest

that the appellant had cried for any help or he had assisted

PW1 to lift the injured to the hospital.    In the event as

suggested by the defence, if the crime was committed by

any other person the appellant should have cried for help

and had been in the forefront      to take the victim to the

hospital.     Though the appellant has stated so when

questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C., there is no

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                               -38-


suggestion to PWs 1 and 2 that the appellant was crying for

help. Whereas the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 is that he was

standing in front of the house with blood stained chopper

without any emotion. That conduct of the appellant is also

inconsistent with the defence plea and consistent with the

prosecution case.

     31. The evidence of PW13 would show that the

injuries were inflicted at vital parts. Injury No.1 would show

that    it even had cut fractured the lamina and spinous

process of the 6th cervical vertebra and ended by transecting

the spinal cord. Injury number 9 to 12, according to PW13,

are defensive injuries. Injury No.9 to 12 would show that

while the victim warding off the cut injuries        was even

amputated the left index and thumb finger as well as the

right index finger. The description of MO1 would show that

the blade is having a length of 24 cms and width of 7 cms

with a handle having a length of 24 cms. It is a sharp

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                               -39-


edged weapon by one side. Injury No.9 to 12 even suggest

that the injuries were inflicted with much force. The nature

of the weapon, namely, the length and width of the blade

and length of the handle would suggest that it is a very

heavy weapon.          Sometimes, that may be used for

agricultural purposes and it may not be one for any

domestic use.       Injury No.1 also would show that the cut

injury was with much force and the other injuries would

suggest that there were repeated attempts causing heavy

bleeding grievous injuries. The nature of the injuries and

the nature of the weapon would suggest that the injuries

were inflicted with pre-determination and     without giving

any opportunity to escape or survive. Strong intention to

cause death is very evident.

     32. In this juncture the motive of the appellant

suggested by the prosecution is very relevant. The evidence

of PW10 and 11 would show that there were repeated

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -40-


demands for more dowry, for which PWs10 and 11 were not

agreeable.     Probably, they might not have any capacity to

heed. It is also pertinent to note that PW10 had deposed

that on the previous day when he telephoned to the

appellant to enquire as to why the appellant and other

members did not join the family for breaking the fast, the

appellant informed that PW10 would know a matter on the

next day which the entire world would listen. That evidence

of PW10 was not shaken in cross-examination. So also the

evidence of PW10 and 11 regarding the demand for more

dowry could not be impeached in cross-examination. The

evidence of PWs 10 and 11 were critically scrutinized by us.

We find that the evidence regarding the motive is also

believable.     Such being the nature of the evidence on

record, on a critical reappraisal, we find that the prosecution

had succeeded to establish that Mymoona was treated with

cruelty in pursuance of demand for dowry and that

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                              -41-


Mymoona was infact butchered by the appellant with MO1

chopper.     We find that the learned Sessions Judge had

correctly analysed the evidence and rightly had come to the

conclusion of guilt against the appellant.     The conviction

under challenge is based upon cogent evidence and requires

no interference.

     33. Regarding the sentence, the learned counsel for

the appellant submitted that the evidence on record is not

sufficient to arrive at a conclusion that the case on hand is

one of the rarest of rare category. On the other hand, the

learned Public Prosecutor submitted that motive, weapon

used by the appellant as well as the force with which the

injuries were inflicted, the number of injuries and the

heinous nature of the crime suggest that the offence is

rarest of rare category and that it was a pre-determined one

and that the crime was committed when PWs.10 and 11

failed to heed the demand for dowry. The learned Public

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -42-


Prosecutor submitted that instances of assault demanding

dowry and following murder are increasing day by day and

this crime may not be dealt as an ordinary murder. We find

some force in the submission made by the learned Public

Prosecutor.     Having heard either side and going by the

decision of the Apex Court in Subash Chander v.

Krishanan Lal and others [2001(4)SCC 458], Prakash

Dhawal Khairnar v. State of Maharashtra [2002(2)SCC

35], Ram Anoop Singh and others v. State of Bihar

[2002(6)SCC 686], Jayawant Dattatraya Suryarao v.

State of Maharashtra       [2001(10) SCC 109] and Swami

Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka [2008(13) SCC

767], we find that the case on hand cannot be categorized

as a rarest of rare case, though it may come under a rare

category. Even in multiple and gruesome murders, the Apex

Court in the ruling cited supra declined to award capital

sentence. But the Apex Court didn't opt to the minimum-

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -43-


the life imprisonment.      Imprisonment was ordered for

higher period, in certain cases, even restriction was imposed

in commutation. Having due regard to the aggravating and

mitigating circumstances, and guided by the decisions of he

Apex Court, we find that though the appellant is not liable to

be sentenced to the maximum, minimum sentence would

not suffice. We, therefore, further find that a sentence of

rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years for offence

under Section 302 of the IPC along with a fine of Rs.

10,00,000/- (ten lakhs only) would be appropriate.         As

regards the sentence for offence under Section 498A of the

IPC, we find that in the light of the sentence for offence

under Section 302 IPC, no separate sentence is warranted.

     34. In the result, we decline to grant confirmation of

the capital sentence for which the reference is made under

Section 366 of the Cr.P.C.     While allowing the appeal in

part, the sentence of death is set aside and instead, the

DSR.4/09 & CA.2650/09
                             -44-


appellant is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 25

years under Section 302 IPC.       The appellant is further

sentenced to a fine of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs

only).     In default,  the appellant shall undergo simple

imprisonment for further period of five years.        While

sustaining conviction for offence under Section 498 IPC, the

separate sentence awarded is set aside. The movable and

immovable properties of the appellant shall be confiscated

and sold in auction with due notice to PW10. The sale

proceeds shall be credited to the    fine amount. The fine

amount on realisation shall be paid to PW10               as

compensation so as to enure the same to be benefit of the

child of the deceased on attaining majority. The Sessions

Judge shall see that the fine amount released to PW10

should be deposited in Fixed Deposit in a nationalised bank

in the name of the minor girl within a week of release and

the Fixed Deposit receipt shall be produced in court. The

                             -45-

only on attaining the majority.

                      -----------------
               CRL.R.P.NO.1803 OF 2013
               -------------------------------
    Dated this the 23rd day of September, 2013

                          ORDER


    The Revision Petitioner is the accused in Sessions

Case No.417 of 2008 on the files of Additional Sessions

Court, Adhoc-III(Fast Track Court-III) Palakkad Division

as well as Petitioner in Crl.M.P.No.1213 of 2013 filed

therein. The above Crl.M.P. was filed under Section 188

of the   Code of Criminal Procedure seeking an order

dropping the proceedings and discharging the accused in

the above case.      But the court below dismissed the

above petition by a common order passed along with

other petitions filed by the complainant under Section

173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The order

dismissing the petition filed under Section 188 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure is under challenge in this

Revision Petition.

    2. The offence alleged to have been committed by

the Revision Petitioner is under Sections 498 A, 304 B

CRL.R.P.NO.1803 OF 2013        2

and 306 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. According to the

de facto complainant the Revision Petitioner married his

daughter on 21/04/2007 and they were living as husband

and wife. The accused was working in Sharjah. After the

marriage the daughter of the de facto complainant was

taken to Sharjah where the Revision Petitioner was

working.     The wife of the Revision Petitioner had

committed suicide on 18/12/2007. It is alleged by the de

facto complainant      that the Revision Petitioner used to

harass his daughter by demanding more money and

dowry and thereby she was driven to committed suicide.

She committed suicide while both were living together in

Sharjah. The learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner

submits that the prosecution has not obtain sanction

under Section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

which is required for prosecution of an offence committed

outside India. Therefore, the court below ought to have

allowed Annexure A petition and ought to have stopped

the trial of the case for want of previous sanction of the

CRL.R.P.NO.1803 OF 2013          3

Central Government as contemplated under Section 188

of Cr.P.C.

      3. Going by the impugned order it is seen that

prosecution also admits the fact that the alleged offence

took place outside India.        The proviso regarding the

sanction is a fetter on powers of investigating authority.

However,     such a fetter can be imposed only when stage

of trial is reached and trial cannot proceed beyond such

stage    without     previous    sanction   of   the     Central

Government. The above view is fortified by the decision

in Thota Venkateswarlu V. State of Andhra Pradesh Through

Principal Secretary and Another [(2011) 9 Supreme Court

Cases 527] which reads as under:

      14. The language of Section 188 CrPC is quite clear

      that when an offence is committed outside India by a

      citizen of India, he may be dealt with in respect of

      such offences as if they had been committed in India.

      The proviso, however, indicates that such offences

      could be inquired into or tried only after having

      obtained   the   previous sanction  of the   Central

      Government. As mentioned hereinbefore, in Ajay

      Aggarwal case2,    it was held that sanction under

      Section 188 CrPC is not a condition precedent for

CRL.R.P.NO.1803 OF 2013          4

      taking cognizance of an offence and, if need be, it

      could be obtained before the trial begins. Even in his

      concurring judgment, R.M. Sahai, J., observed as

      follows:(SCC p.628, para 29)


           "29. Language of the section is plain and

           simple. It operates where an offence is

           committed by a citizen of India outside the

           country. Requirements are, therefore, one -

           commission of offence; second - by an Indian

           citizen; and third - that it should have been

           committed outside the country."



      But, in the impugned common order passed jointly

along with the other two petitions, the court below has

not applied its mind on the issue raised in CMP.No.1213

of 2013. A prosecution without sanction is invalid as well

as void ab initio. Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is

an issue to be decided on merits before proceeding with

the trial. But, unfortunately, the learned Sessions Judge

has not considered the issue meticulously.          Therefore, I

am inclined to set aside the order under challenge passed

in C.M.P.No.1213 of 2013 and I do so.             The matter is

remitted back to the learned Sessions Judge and the

CRL.R.P.NO.1803 OF 2013      5

learned Sessions Judge shall restore the application on

the files and pass an order afresh after hearing both

parties. The trial will stand deferred till the disposal of

the above petition.

            ----------------------------------------------------------------
                     Dated this the 28th day of July, 2008

                                   JUDGMENT


Harun-Ul-Rashid, J.

      The petitioner in O.P. No.584 of 2004 on the file of the Family

Court, Thiruvalla is the appellant. The Family Court summarily dismissed

the said Original Petition filed for recovery of gold ornaments and money

holding that there is no matrimonial dispute and hence this appeal. The

parties herein are referred to as petitioner and respondents as in the

Original Petition.



      2. The marriage between the parties was solemnised on 5.1.1995. It

is the case of the petitioner/wife that an amount of Rs.3,00,000/- and 40

sovereigns of gold ornaments were given to her at the time of marriage. It

is also alleged inter alia that her life with the first respondent/husband was

not a happy one and that the respondents ill treated her mentally and

physically demanding more dowry.             She also contended that the amount

given to her which was entrusted with the respondents                         was

misappropriated by them.         According to the petitioner, the reason stated

for the dismissal of the Original Petition is not correct and that the

conclusion arrived at is without any basis.

Mat. Appeal No.161/2005               2




      3. We have gone through the impugned judgment and we find that

the Family Court, without going into the merits of the claim, summarily

dismissed the Original Petition stating that the petitioner and her husband

are residing together.    That is not a reason for dismissing the Original

Petition in view of the pleadings regarding the entrustment of money and

gold ornaments and the relief claimed in the petition. The matter should

be decided on merits after considering the pleadings and evidence of the

parties.



      In the result, the Matrimonial Appeal is allowed. The judgment

under appeal is set aside.     The case is remanded to the Family Court,

Thiruvalla for de novo consideration. The parties are at liberty to adduce

evidence, if any, in support of their respective contentions.   The Family

Court shall decide the matter within a period of six months from the date

of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There will be no order as to costs.

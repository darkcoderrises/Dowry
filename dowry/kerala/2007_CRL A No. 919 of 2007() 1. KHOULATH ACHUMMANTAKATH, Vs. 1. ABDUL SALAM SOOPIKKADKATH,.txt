             ----------------------------------------------------------------


                    Dated this the 17th  day of December, 2007


                                      JUDGMENT


Harun-Ul-Rashid, J.


       The appellant is the complainant in C.C. No.705 of 2002 on the file


of the  Judicial  First  Class  Magistrate's  Court,  Payyannur.    The case  was


taken   on  file  as   a  protest   complaint   as   the  earlier  complaint   filed   by  the


appellant   was     referred   for   investigation   and   a   crime   was   registered   in


which the police filed refer report.  The allegation in the complaint is that


respondents   1   to   5   and   another   committed   offence   punishable   under


Section 498 A read with Section 34 I.P.C.





       2.  The first respondent in the appeal is the husband of the appellant.


The   marriage   between   the   appellant   and   the   first   respondent   was


solemnized on 21.5.1998 according to the customary rites prevalent in the


community.     According   to   the   appellant/wife,   she   was   put   to   untold


miseries and harassment by her husband and his relatives demanding more


money as dowry.





       3.   Today, we have dismissed  Mat. Appeal No.107 of 2007 filed by


the   first   respondent   herein   seeking   to   set   aside   the   judgment   in   O.P.


CRL.APPEAL NO.919/2007                        2




No.242 of 2004 by which the Family Court, Kannur allowed the petition


filed by the wife for dissolution of marriage.





        4.     The   evidence   of   the   appellant   and   another   witness   who   were


examined  as  PWs.1  and   2 respectively  were  recorded  under  Section  442


Cr.P.C.   and   charges   were   framed   against   the   accused   for   the   offence


mentioned above.  No oral  or documentary evidence was adduced on the


side of the defence.     On going through the evidence of PWs.1 and 2, the


learned Magistrate noted  that   the evidence  of PW.2  was not convincing


and   that   his   evidence   does   not   support   the   case   of   PW.1   in   material


particulars.       Therefore,   after   considering   the   entire   evidence,   the   court


below rightly held that the complainant had not succeeded in proving the


allegations against the accused.





        We   find   no   reason   to   interfere   with   the   finding   of   the   learned


Magistrate.  Hence, the appeal is dismissed.





                                                      (KURIAN JOSEPH, JUDGE)





                                                  (HARUN-UL-RASHID,   JUDGE)

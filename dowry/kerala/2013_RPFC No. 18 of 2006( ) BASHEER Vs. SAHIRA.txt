          The Revision petitioner is the respondent in

M.C.No.34 of 2005 on the files of the Family Court,

Kozhikode. The above M.C was filed by the respondents

under Sec.125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking

maintenance allowance from the revision petitioner. The

respondents are the wife and child of the revision

petitioner. According to them, the revision petitioner has

been neglecting them and refused to pay maintenance

allowance to them.     The 1st respondent has no job or

income.   They are unable to maintain themselves.     The

revision petitioner has sufficient means to pay the

maintenance allowance to them.         The 1st respondent

claimed  2,500/- per month and the 2nd respondent claimed

 1,500/- from the revision petitioner as maintenance

allowance. But the learned family court judge directed the

 R.P.(F.C).No. 18 of 2006
                                2

revision petitioner to pay  1,250/- per month to the 1st

respondent and  800/- per month to the 2nd respondent.

This order is under challenge in this revision petition.

     2. It is the case of the 1st respondent that her marriage

with the revision petitioner was solemnized on 27th

September, 1998 and the 2nd respondent is the child born in

that wedlock. At the time of marriage, 25 sovereigns of

gold ornaments and an amount of  35,000/- were given but

the same were misappropriated by the revision petitioner

within a short span of time. Thereafter, demanding more

dowry and assets, he began to harass the 1st respondent;

while so he had gone to Kuwait in the year 2001 and

secured a job there. At that time, she had been subjected to

cruelty by her in-laws in his absence.        Though he was

employed      abroad, no amount had been given to the

respondents for their maintenance. He returned from the

gulf in the year 2004 and thereafter he joined with his

sisters to harass the 1st respondent for more dowry. He

 R.P.(F.C).No. 18 of 2006
                             3

frequently threatened that he will pronounce thalak unless

her parents give more dowry. At last, she had been driven

out from the house in the year 2004. Thereafter, he has

been neglecting and no amount had been paid so far

towards the maintenance of the respondents.

     3.  The 1st respondent has no job or income.       The

second respondent is a student studying at school level.

Now, the respondents are depending upon her relatives;

whereas the revision petitioner has sufficient means. While

employed in gulf he was getting  30,000/- per month and at

present he is getting  300/- per day as he is engaged with

the work of preparing or making food items to bakery. The

revision petitioner had miserably failed to show that the

respondents have sufficient income and they are able

enough to maintain themselves. The revision petitioner has

no case that he is physically unhealthy or disabled or

incapacitated so as to do work as to earn his livelihood. A

physically able bodied man is presumed to be having

 R.P.(F.C).No. 18 of 2006
                               4

sufficient earning capacity.      It is a matter of common

knowledge that now a days a coolly worker is getting an

average of  500/- per day.

     4. Having considered the standard of life, the living

cost of the respondents and the income of the revision

petitioner, I am of the opinion that the direction to pay 

1,250/- to the 1st respondent and  800/- to the 2           nd



respondent is just and proper.       There is no illegality or

impropriety in the said finding and I do not find any kind of

perversity in the appreciation of evidence, by which the

quantum of maintenance has been determined.               The

revision petition is devoid of merits.

     Consequently, this revision petition is dismissed.

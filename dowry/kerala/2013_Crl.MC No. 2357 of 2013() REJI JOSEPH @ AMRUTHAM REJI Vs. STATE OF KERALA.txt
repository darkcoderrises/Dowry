                 --------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
               ----------------------------------
               Dated this the 11th day of June, 2013

                            ORDER

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is an accused in C.C.No.3116/2012 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thrissur which is a case

instituted upon the police report in Crime No.460/2012 of

Nedupuzha Police Station for the offences punishable under

Sections. 406, 420, 465, 506(ii) of I.P.C., with a prayer to

quash Annexure 3 final report against the petitioner in

C.C.3116/2012 pending on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court No.II, Thrissur considering Annexure 6 as the

matter is settled out of court.

         2.       The allegation in the above case is that

complainant is a social worker and Managing Trustee of

Charitable Trust namely Kerla Vikaskendram. Under the guise

of making the life history of patron Panakkad Sayyed

Mohammedali Shihabu Thangal, the petitioner appraoched the

complainant and got befriended with her. It is made to believe

that the petitioner is constructing a three storied building for

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                2

starting ayurvedic treatment for cancer namely Amruthan

Ayurveda      Cancer    Research Centre   and  requested     the

complainant to have her daughter, who completed Ayurvedic

course, as partner in the above named Centre. The petitioner

had made the complainant to believe that he had business

establishments at various Gulf countries. Thus after getting the

full confidence of the complainant, the petitioner at various

stages obtained an amount of Rs.31,57,600/- from the

complainant. The complainant gave the said amount even by

pledging the ornaments of her daughter. Other than the

above, the petitioner had taken 272 grams of gold ornaments

from the complainant and obtained Rs.5 lakhs by pledging

the same with Golden Finance, Vadakkumchery. Later as per

the request of the petitioner, the complainant gave Rs.4 lakhs

which was obtained from one Gokulan Master of Thrissur. Later

the complainant was forced to give Rs.4 lakhs to Gopalan

Master from her account. It is alleged that the petitioner

promised to give 50% share in Amrutham Ayurveda Cancer

Research Centre and he made to believe that the same will be

inaugurated by 01/01/2012. By the above said act the

petitioner cheated Rs.31,57,600/- and 272 gram of gold

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                3

ornaments from the complainant and committed offences

under Section 406,420,465,506(2) r/w 34 of the Indian Penal

Code and now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is

settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above ccrime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against her.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                 4

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only 406, 420, 465, 506(ii) r/w 34 of the

Indian Penal Code which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioner accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them.       In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)]. In which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from

          the above discussion can be summarised

          thus:      the power of the High Court in

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                   5

          quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

          complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the

          power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for

          compounding the offences under S.320 of

          the Code.       Inherent power is of wide

          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it

          has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

          flavour stand on different footing for the

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                   6

          purposes      of  quashing,   particularly  the

          offences       arising   from     commercial,

          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or

          such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong

          is basically private or personal in nature

          and the parties have resolved their entire

          dispute.     In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

          its   view,    because   of  the  compromise

          between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

          and continuation of criminal case would put

          accused to great oppression and prejudice

          and extreme injustice would be caused to

          him by not quashing the criminal case

          despite     full and complete settlement and

          compromise with the victim........"

          8.          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

Crl.M.C.No. 2357 of 2013
                                 7

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. In

my view, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on

with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter

is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -3 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 3116 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Thrissur.

             Dated this the 3rd day of July, 2014

                           O R D E R

     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     Petitioners are accused nos. 1 to 5 in Crime

No.246/2014 of Kanakakkunnu Police Station, which has

been registered for the offence under section 498A IPC.

     2.   The 1st petitioner is the husband of the 1st

informant. The other petitioners are his father, aunts and

sister.  It is alleged that demanding more dowry they

subjected her to cruelty.

     3.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     4.   The prosecution has no case that any of the

petitioners inflicted any serious injuries to the 1st informant.

The 1st petitioner and the 1st informant have been married

for the last seven years.           They have two children.

Restoration of harmony to the family is not impossible. If

the petitioners happen to be detained, that will adversely

affect the chance of reunion. So I am inclined to grant the

prayer of the petitioners.

           connection with this case.

      ii.  They shall appear before the Investigating

           Officer for interrogation if they are so

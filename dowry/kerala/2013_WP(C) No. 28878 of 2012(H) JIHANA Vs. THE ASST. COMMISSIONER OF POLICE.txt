                      W.P.(C). NO. 28878 OF 2012 H
                  -----------------------------------------------
                    Dated this the 4th January, 2013

                              JUDGMENT

K.M. Joseph, J.

      Petitioners have approached this Court seeking the following

reliefs:

            "i)   Issue a writ of mandamus or any other
      appropriate writ, order or direction, directing
      respondents 2 to 4 to give adequate and effective
      police protection to the petitioners and family
      members from the act and interferences and violence
      of respondents 5 to 9 or persons claiming under
      them.
            ii)  Issue a writ of mandamus or any other
      appropriate writ, order or direction, directing the
      first respondent to give adequate and effective police
      protection to the petitioners for doing business at FM
      Kids Fashion, CB 34, C block, New Saphalyam
      Complex, Palayam, Thiruvananthapuram from the
      act and interferences, obstructions and violence of
      respondents 5 to 9 or persons claiming under them."


      2. Briefly put, the case of the petitioners is as follows:

      First petitioner married the fifth respondent in the year 2005

WP(C).NO.28878/12 H                2

and in the said wedlock, the second petitioner was born. At the

time of marriage, sixty sovereigns of gold, one lakh rupees in cash

and five cents of property were given. From the early days of

marriage itself, the first petitioner was brutally harassed mentally

and physically by the fifth respondent, demanding more dowry and

other luxuries. First petitioner is now five months pregnant. She

was compelled to sell her property and take a shop room at

Palayam. Fifth respoondent obtained money from many money

lenders and led a loose moral life, usurping the erring from the

shop also. Cheques of the first petitioner were issued forging her

signature. Now, respondents 6 to 9 are threatening the petitioner

and their family. The minor second petitioner could not be sent to

school.   Fifth respondent is doing all sorts of mischiefs even

threatening the doctor of the first petitioner compelling to

terminate the present pregnancy. Petitioner has approached the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court against the fifth respondent.

The party respondents have umpteen numbers of legal remedies, if

WP(C).NO.28878/12 H                3

they have any grievances. Without resorting to that, the petitioner

and her family are being threatened using muscle power.

     3. We heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Government Pleader.         Though service is complete on

respondents 5 to 9, there is no appearance for them. We have

already passed the following interim order dated 07.12.2012:

            "There will be an interim order directing the

      fourth respondent to give effective police protection

      to the life of the petitioners as against respondents 5

      to 9."

Again on 14.12.2012, we have passed another interim order which

reads as follows:

            "There will be an interim order directing the

      first respondent to afford police protection for

      conducting the business of the first petitioner from

      any interference caused by respondents 5 to 9."

     4. We see no reason not to make the interim orders absolute.

Accordingly, we dispose of the Writ Petition by making the interim

orders dated 07.12.2012 and 14.12.2012 absolute and further

WP(C).NO.28878/12 H             4

directing that police protection shall be granted as and when

required. We, however, make it clear that this Judgment will not

stand in the way of the party respondents seeking any remedies

before any competent forum in regard to the shop.

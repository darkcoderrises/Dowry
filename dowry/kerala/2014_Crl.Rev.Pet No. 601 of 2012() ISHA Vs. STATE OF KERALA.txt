                                ORDER


     This Criminal Revision Petition is filed by the second

accused in C.C. No.18 of 2008 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court -1, Kochi. In that case, accused Nos.1 and 2

are charge sheeted under Section 498(A) read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code (for short 'the IPC').

     2. The prosecution case is that the first accused married

PW3 on 12.2.2006 as per the customs prevailed among the

community. The first accused had obtained 12 sovereigns of

gold ornaments and `3 lakhs as dowry and both of them were

living happily as husband and wife for sometime. The first

Crl.R.P.No.601 of 2012
                                  :2:

    accused started harassing her demanding more dowry and to

    part with the landed property belonging to PW3 and thereby the

    accused committed the offence as alleged. The 2nd accused,

    who is the mother of the first accused was also implicated as an

    accused.

          3. The trial court convicted accused Nos.1 and 2 under

    Section 498A read with Section 34 of the IPC and sentenced

    them to undergo simple imprisonment for two years each and to

    pay a fine of `5,000/- each in default to undergo simple

    imprisonment for one month each. Against that conviction and

    sentence first accused filed Criminal Appeal No.88 of 2011 and

    second accused filed Criminal Appeal No.80 of 2011 before

    the Additional Sessions (Adhoc - II) Court, Ernakulam which

    were allowed in part. The conviction of both accused under

    Section 498A read with Section 34 of the IPC was confirmed

    and they were sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for

Crl.R.P.No.601 of 2012
                                   :3:

    six months each and to pay a fine of `5,000/- each in default to

    undergo simple imprisonment for one month each. Against that

    judgment, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.80 of 2011

    filed this Criminal Revision Petition.

          4.     During the pendency of this Criminal Revision

    Petition, the revision petitioner       filed Crl.M. Application

    No.1626 of 2014 under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

    Procedure to quash the conviction and sentence, as the matter is

    amicably settled between the parties. The second respondent/

    de facto complainant filed an affidavit stating that the matter is

    settled and that she has no objection in quashing the sentence

    and conviction of the revision petitioner.

          5. In the decision reported in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State

    of Punjab ([2008(3) KLT 19 (Supreme Court)], it was held :

                     "Criminal    proceedings     involving       non-

               compoundable offences can be quashed by accepting the

               terms of compromise reached between the rival parties, if

Crl.R.P.No.601 of 2012
                                        :4:

               the question involved in such disputes is purely of a

               personal nature."


         6. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

  [2012 (4) KLT 108 (Supreme Court)], it was held thus :


              "57. The power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

       proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

       jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

       criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

       Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

       limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

       engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the ends of justice or

       (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases

       power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R

       may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled

       their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of

       each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before

       exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to

       the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

       offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

       dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim

       or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.

       Such offences are not private in nature and have serious impact

Crl.R.P.No.601 of 2012
                                      :5:

       on society. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

       pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

       purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

       commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like

       transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to

       dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

       private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

       entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash

       criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise

       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is

       remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put

       accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

       would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

       despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the

       victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it

       would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue

       with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

       proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

       despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

       wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

       appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

       to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

       be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal

       proceeding."

Crl.R.P.No.601 of 2012
                                   :6:

         7. Since the matter is amicably settled between the parties,

   I am of the view that in order to secure the ends of justice, the

   conviction and sentence of the second accused under Section

   498(A) read with Section 34 of the IPC in C.C. No.18 of 2008

   on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -1, Kochi, has

   to be set aside.   Hence Crl.M. Application No.1626 of 2014 is

   allowed.

         Accordingly this Criminal Revision Petition is allowed.

   The conviction and sentence of the second accused in C.C.

   No.18 of 2008 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate

   Court -1, Kochi under Section Section 498(A) read with Section

   34 of the IPC is quashed and she is acquitted and set at liberty.

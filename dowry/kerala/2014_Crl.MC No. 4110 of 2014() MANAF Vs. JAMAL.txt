                        Crl.M.C.No. 4110 of 2014

                 Dated this the 19th day of August, 2014

                                 O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No. 1756/2014 of

Muvattupuzha Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

294(b),323,324,341,506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings against the petitioners herein in Crime

No.1756/2014 of Muvattupuzha Police Station in pursuance of

AnenxureA FIR, as the matter is settled out of court.

          2.  The allegation in the above case is that on 6.7.2014 at about

3.15 p.m. the first petitioner herein showered abusive words on the first

respondent herein and had wrongfully restrained him and had threatened

him with a knife and the second petitioner herein had beaten on the back

of the first respondent and thereby resulting the injuries o the fingers of

the first respondent and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter

Crl.M.C.No.4110 of 2014


                                     :-2-:

is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant/injured does not intend to proceed

any further against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

Crl.M.C.No.4110 of 2014


                                          :-3-:

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

294(b),323,324,341,506(ii) read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note

that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.                   From the

submission made by the counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me that

the injured/the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.                 In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
          can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
          Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

Crl.M.C.No.4110 of 2014


                                          :-4-:

           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

                                     :-5-:

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.        Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further

proceedings against the petitioners herein in Crime No.1756/2014 of

Muvattupuzha Police Station in pursuance of AnenxureA FIR.

               ---------------------------------------
            Dated this the 21st day of August, 2013.

                            O R D E R

      Petitioner is the accused in crime No. 621/2013 of

Chengamanadu Police Station, registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498(A)IPC. He has filed the above

application seeking pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, for short,'the Code'.

      2. De-facto complainant in the above crime is the wife of

the petitioner. In the wedlock the spouses have a child aged

six years.     Ever since her marriage, petitioner inflicted

inhuman cruelty, both physical and mental, demanding dowry,

and on previous occasions as well she had to approach police

with complaints of torture, is her case. Immediate cause for

filing the complaint before police was an incident which

occurred on 04.06.2013. When she was awaiting at the bus

stop for returning home after attending office petitioner

forcefully dragged her to a nearby municipality compound and

attempted to snatch away her gold chain. Timely intervention

of some persons including staff members of her office, who

were present in the bus stop prevented him from snatching her

B.A.No.4519/2013                2

gold chain, is her case.

      3. Crime registered with allegation as aforesaid is now

pending investigation. Petitioner has moved the above petition

invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court to grant

him anticipatory bail apprehending his arrest in the crime.

      4. After hearing the submissions made by counsel and

also by learned Public Prosecutor and taking note of the facts

and circumstances, I find this is not a fit case where petitioner

can be extended the discretionary relief applied for. He has to

surrender and co-operate with the investigation of the crime.

      Petition dismissed.

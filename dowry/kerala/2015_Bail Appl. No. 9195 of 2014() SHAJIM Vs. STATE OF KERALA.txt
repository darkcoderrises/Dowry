                  B.A. No.9195 of 2014

         Dated this the 7th day of January, 2015

                         ----------------

         Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.  Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.1537

of 2014 of Pallithottam Police Police Station registered

for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and

323 read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.  The 2nd petitioner is the mother of the 1st

petitioner. The allegation against the petitioners is

that, they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry,

after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and

money. It is specifically alleged that the defacto

complainant was being brutally beaten on almost

every day by the 1st petitioner. More than once, she

B.A. No.9195 of 2014      2

had to attend the hospital in connection with such

physical torture from the part of the 1st petitioner.

     4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

and the learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the CD.

Copies of the wound certificates and treatment

certificates are available among the records in the CD.

The contents of the CD prima facie reveal the

complicity of the petitioners. At the same time, as far

as the 2nd petitioner who is the mother of the 1st

petitioner is concerned, even though she had assisted

the 1st petitioner in carrying out harassment on the

defacto complainant, I am of the view that she can be

enlarged on bail considering the fact that she is an

aged woman. Considering the nature of allegations

raised against the 1st petitioner, I am satisfied that he

is not entitled to the discretionary relief of anticipatory

bail.

          5.   In the result, this bail application is

allowed in part and the investigating officer or such

other police officer, who is conducting the arrest of the

B.A. No.9195 of 2014      3

2nd petitioner, is directed to enlarge the 2nd petitioner

on bail in the event of her arrest on her executing a

bond for `50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) with

two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

          (i)   The 2nd petitioner shall report

     before the investigating officer in between

     9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on all Wednesdays and

     Saturdays, commencing from 14-01-2015 for

     a period of three months or till the filing of

     the final report in this case, whichever is

     earlier.

          (ii) The 2nd petitioner shall not tamper

     with the evidence or influence witnesses.

          (iii) The   2nd  petitioner  shall  make

     herself available for interrogation as and

     when required by the investigating officer.

          (iv) The 2nd petitioner shall not involve

     in any offence while on bail.

     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions    stipulated  above    will result  in    the

cancellation of bail granted to the 2nd petitioner. This

B.A. No.9195 of 2014    4

application, as far as the 1st petitioner is concerned,

stands dismissed.

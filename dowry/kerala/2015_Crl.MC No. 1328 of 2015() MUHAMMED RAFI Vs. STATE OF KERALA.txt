                  Dated this the 20th day of March 2015

                                      ORDER


      Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under Section 482

Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A F.I.R. in Crime No.53/2015 of

Kazhakuttom Police Station and all further proceedings pursuant to

it as against the petitioner, quashed.

      2.     The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is his wife, and

treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC,

by demanding more dowry.

      3.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

Crl.M.C.1328/2015                2

      4.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      5.     The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably settled

and, therefore, she has no complaints against the petitioner, and,

hence, all further proceedings in the matter referred to above can

be quashed. She has entered appearance through her counsel. The

learned counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on

her own volition.

      6.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

Crl.M.C.1328/2015                  3

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in the

interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A F.I.R.

in Crime No.53/2015 of Kazhakuttom Police Station and all further

proceedings based on it, are hereby quashed.

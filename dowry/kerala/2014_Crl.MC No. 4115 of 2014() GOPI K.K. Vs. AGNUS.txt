                Crl.M.C.No.4115 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
          Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014.


                         O R D E R

     The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.886/14 of

Puthencruz Police Station and he preferred this petition

under section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure 1 FIR in the above crime.

   2. The allegation is that the petitioner married the 1st

respondent on 11.11.1994 and while they were living

together in the matrimonial home, the petitioner harassed

the 1st respondent both mentally and physically and also

once attempted to chop her with the chopper.        Thus a

crime was registered as Crime No.886/14 of Puthencruz

Police Station, for the offence punishable under sections

498A and 324 of IPC.

       3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 1st respondent, and the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.4115 of 2014
                               2

Prosecutor.

        4.    Now the case of the petitioner is that the entire

dispute has been settled with the 1st respondent as evident

by Annexure 2 agreement and thus they have decided to

dissolve the marriage. The counsel appearing for the 1st

respondent has also admitted the said fact.            The 1st

respondent has also sworn into an affidavit dated

17.7.2014, which is produced as Annexure 3, wherein it is

stated that due to the intervention of mediators and well

wishers, the dispute has been settled and thus an

agreement was arrived into and she has no objection in

allowing the petition as prayed for. In the above facts and

circumstances of the case, I am of the view that, as the

parties to the dispute, who are husband and wife, have

settled the matter, it is only just and proper to allow this

petition, otherwise no purpose will be served, if the trial is

proceeded against the petitioner. Accordingly, this petition

can be allowed, in view of the decision of the Honourable

Crl.M.C.No.4115 of 2014
                                    3

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power      given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

Crl.M.C.No.4115 of 2014
                                   4

         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

           In the result, this M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 FIR in Crime No.886/14 of Puthencruz Police

Station, and all further proceedings thereto against the

petitioner.

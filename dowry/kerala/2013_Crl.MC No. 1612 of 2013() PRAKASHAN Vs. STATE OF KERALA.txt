                Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
        Dated this the 25th day of June, 2013


                          O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the 1st accused in Crime

No. 109/90 of Poochakkal Police Station, for the offences

punishable under Sections 323, 324, 341 r/w 34 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure A1, A2, A3 and all further

proceedings against the petitioner in L.P.No.9/99 pending

on the file of the JFCM court-II, Cherthala, in the above

crime, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that the de

facto complainant launched a complaint before the police

against A1 and A2 and because of the said animosity, the

accused at about 11 p.m. on 12.9.1990 attacked the de

facto complainant, by which he sustained injuries and thus

the accused had committed offences punishable under

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013


sections 323, 324, 341 r/w 34 of IPC and now, the case of

the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that during the pendency of the above crime,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received        from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and he has no grievance

against him.

         6.       I have carefully considered the above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

                             3
Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013


documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under sections 323,

324, 341 r/w 34 of IPC, which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made

by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

                                   4
Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013


reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-




                 "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
         from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the   criminal    cases   having
         overwhelmingly     and   pre-dominatingly    civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or
         the offences arising out of matrimony relating
         to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because      of the  compromise     between    the

                                  5
Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013


         offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
         is remote and bleak and continuation of
         criminal case would put accused to great
         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
         would be caused to him by not quashing the
         criminal case despite      full and complete
         settlement     and   compromise       with    the
         victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances         involved  in   the     present      case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with

the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is

settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the

trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net

result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to

me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C.

                               6
Crl.M.C.No.1612 of 2013


can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure - A1, A2, A3 and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in Crime No.109/90 of Poochakkal

Police Station.

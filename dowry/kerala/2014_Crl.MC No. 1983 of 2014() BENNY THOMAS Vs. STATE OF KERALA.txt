    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 07th day of April, 2014.


                           O R D E R


      This is an application filed by the sole accused in

C.C.No.170/14 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Nedumgandam, to quash the proceedings in view of the

settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that, on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant, a crime was registered as Crime No.287/10 of

Nedumgandam Police Station against the petitioner and others

alleging offences under Sections 418, 465, 467, 471, 468 and

474 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Later, after

investigation, final report was filed only against the present

petitioner, deleting other accused persons alleging offences

under Sections 418, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 474 of Indian

Penal Code and the case was taken on file as C.C.No.170/14

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Nedumgandam. Now, the matter has been settled between

the parties. The property belongs to respondents 2 and 3 and

Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014      :  2 :

now they have ratified the act of the accused after receiving

the consideration mentioned in the document and now they do

not want to proceed with the case in view of the settlement of

the case. Since the offence alleged are non-compoundable in

nature, he could not file an application before the lower court

for this purpose.      So, he has no other option except to

approach this court seeking the following relief:

           "To    quash Annexure     I  Final  Report    in

    C.C.No.170/2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate

    Court, Nedumgandam and all further proceedings

    pursuant to the same, to secure the ends of justice."

      3.     Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties and they do not want to prosecute the case and they

filed Annexure 2 and 3 affidavits stating these facts.         The

Counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction.     So, he

prayed for allowing the application.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that, there is no other case

against the petitioner, but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that originally on the basis of

Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014    :   3 :

the statement given by the second respondent on his behalf

and on behalf of the third respondent, Crime No.287/10 of

Nedumgandam Police Station was registered alleging offences

under Sections 418, 465, 467, 468, 471, 474 read with Section

34 of Indian Penal Code against the present petitioner and

others. But, after investigation, the investigating officer filed

Annexure A1 final report against the present petitioner alone

deleting the other accused persons for the offences under

Sections 418, 465, 467, 468, 471, 474 of Indian Penal Code.

and it is now pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Nedumgandam as C.C.No.170/14. Now, the matter has

been settled between the petitioner and respondents 2 and 3

and they filed Annexure A2 and A3 affidavits stating these

facts. It is also submitted by the Counsel for the respondents

2 and 3 that, the act of the accused person was ratified and

they have received the consideration mentioned in the

document which the accused has received from the other

accused persons who were deleted from the party array of

accused later. Since it is a civil dispute regarding the property

resulted in registering of criminal offence and the matter has

been settled between the parties, there is no possibility of

Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014        :  4 :

conviction as neither the de facto complainant nor the other

witnesses will support the case of the prosecution.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the

Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014         :  5 :

      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision also      and considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and no public interest is

involved and as it is not a case of offence affecting the

society     at large but only a property dispute between

individuals and        in view of the settlement, the original

relationship has been restored between the parties and no

purpose      will be     served by proceeding with the case as

conviction will be remote and it will be wastage of judicial

time, this Court feels that it is a fit case where power under

Section 482 of the Code has to be invoked to quash the

Crl.M.C.No.1983 of 2014       : 6 :

proceedings      in   order  to  promote  the  settlement and

restoration of      relationship between the parties   and the

pendency of this case will not be a hurdle for the same.

      So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.170/14 (Crime No.287/10 of Nedumgandam Police

Station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Nedumgadam as against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to     communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

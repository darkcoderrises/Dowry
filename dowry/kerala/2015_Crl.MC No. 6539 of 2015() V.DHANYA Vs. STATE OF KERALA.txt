        Dated this the 20th day of October, 2015

                               ORDER

           This petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, for quashing Annexure A1

First Information Report, in Crime No.212/2015 of Adoor

Police station, filed under Section 57 of the Kerala Police

Act.

           2. The facts of the case in a nutshell is that

the   marriage      between       the    petitioner      and     second

respondent       was      solemnized         on      20.01.2011      at

Parthasaradhi swamy temple, Adoor, as per Hindu

religious and rites. In the wedlock one child was born to

them. At the time of marriage, a sum of Rs.25 lakhs and

50 sovereigns of gold ornaments were given to the second

respondent by the parents of the petitioner. The second

respondent      misappropriated          the    money        and   gold

ornaments for his own purposes. From the beginning of

the marriage, the second respondent and his parents

Crl.M.C.No.6539 of 2015           2

harassed       the     petitioner mentally and     physically,

demanding more dowry.            The second respondent is a

drunkard and he has no love and affection towards the

petitioner and his child.        When their relationship got

strained, the petitioner approached the Family Court,

Pathanamthitta by filing O.P.(HMA)No.919/2015, seeking

dissolution of the marriage. The second respondent had

filed a complaint on 19.02.2015 for 'person missing' and

accordingly, the above crime has been registered under

Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act by the first respondent.

Being aggrieved by that she preferred this petition.

             3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and the learned Public Prosecutor, appearing for the first

respondent.

             4. The learned counsel for the petitioner

contended that the petitioner is not missing and now

residing in her friend's house in Thrissur district and today

when the case is taken up, she is present before this

Court. Annexure A1 was filed by the second respondent

only to harass her. In the circumstances, the petitioner

prays to quash Annexure A1, invoking the inherent

Crl.M.C.No.6539 of 2015        3

jurisdiction vested in this Court. The learned Public

Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is changing her

location and therefore Police could not trace out the

missing wife of the second respondent and not yet

interrogated.

             5. For ascertaining the truth of the allegation

the investigating agency has to question the parties.

             In the circumstances, the petitioner is directed

to appear before the investigating officer to find out the

truth of the allegation. If the investigating agency, after

interrogation, feels that there is no man missing in their

case, they shall close the matter and set her at liberty.

Since a dispute is pending as O.P.(HMA)No.919/2015

before the Family court, Pathanamthitta, they can choose

their proper forum for settling the disputes between them.

This criminal miscellaneous case is closed, directing the

petitioner to appear before the investigating officer on

28.10.2015.

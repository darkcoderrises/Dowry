              ----------------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.No. 53 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013


                           O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioner, who is the de facto complainant in Crime

No.80 of 2009 of Ponnani police station, pending as

C.C.No.200 of 2009 on the file of the Munsiff Magistrate

Court, Ponnani, for the offence punishable under Sections

406, 415, 417, 420 r/w 34 of IPC, with a prayer to quash

Crime No.80 of 2009 of Ponnani police station, now pending

as C.C.No.200 of 2009 on the file of the Munsiff Magistrate

Court, Ponnani, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the respondents.       I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       3.     The case of the petitioner is that respondent

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                                :-2-:

nos.2 to 5 made believe the petitioner that 4= cents of

property and the building comprising there in R.Sy. 135/2,

154/1 of Ezhavathuruthi Amsom Desom belonged to them

and that they intended to sell the above property.          The

further allegation against the accused, who are respondent

nos.2 to 5 is that, they had made the petitioner believe that

an amount of `50,000/- was received by them as security

deposit from the tenants of the premises of the respondents

and that the tenants are paying `10,000/- as monthly rent to

respondent nos.2 to 5. According to the petitioner, it is

subsequently realised that what all representation made by

accused are false and the same are made with an intention

to cheat him.        Thus, altogether, the petitioner had paid a

sum of `5 lakhs to the respondents and also made payments

subsequent to that, and thus they have committed offences

punishable under sections 406, 415, 417, 420 r/w 34 of IPC.

Now the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                            :-3-:

out of court and they have entered into compromise as

evident from Annexure-4.      According to the petitioner,

connected with the above transaction, a suit was filed by

him as O.S.No.196/08 in the Sub court, Tirur, and during the

pendency of the above suit, the matter was settled at the

Legal Services Authority at Tirur, and consequently they

arrived in Annexure-4 settlement.     The counsel for the

petitioner as well as the respondents submitted that in the

light of Annexure-4 settlement, the proceedings against

respondent nos.2 to 5 in C.C.No.200/09 pending before the

Munsiff Magistrate's court, Ponnani, may be dropped.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner/de facto

complainant submitted that as the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject

matter of the above case, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                              :-4-:

         5.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos.2

to 5/accused nos.1 to 4, who on the basis of specific

instruction received from the respondents, submitted that

the matter is settled out of court and pleaded for dropping

the proceedings pending against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. Annexure-4 is the compromise

petition in O.S.No.196/08, entered into between the

petitioner/de facto complainant and respondents 2 to 5/

accused.      I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition. In the given facts

and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of

the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

allowing the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                                  :-5-:

involved in the above case are only under Sections 406, 415,

417, 420 r/w 34 of IPC, which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties

to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.         From the submission made by the

counsel for the petitioner/de facto complainant, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the respondents/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note that the Honourable Apex Court,                 in the decision

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held

as follows:-

                "57.   The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the    power   given  to   a   criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                                   :-6-:

         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
         statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
         viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
         power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute
         would depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But    the    criminal     cases      having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
         stand on different footing for the purposes of
         quashing, particularly the offences arising from
         commercial,        financial,    mercandile,        civil,
         partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
         etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is
         basically private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
         proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme
         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
         the criminal case despite          full and complete
         settlement and compromise with the victim........"



          In the present case, the offences involved are under

Sections 406, 415, 417, 420 r/w 34 of IPC. The criminal

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                             :-7-:

proceedings for the said offences originated from the issues

are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus to

the criminal case as well. According to me, in the light of

the facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be squarely

applicable in the present case.    According to me, as the

parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.          It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court,

in the event of the trial proceeded, there would not have

any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief

Crl.M.C.No.2589 of 2013


                             :-8-:

as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings in Crime No.80 of 2009 of Ponnani

police station, now pending as C.C.No.200 of 2009 on the

file of the Munsiff Magistrate Court, Ponnani.

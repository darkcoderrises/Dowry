                  Crl.M.C. NO. 2466 of 2014
            ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 13th day of May, 2014

                                ORDER


            Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 3 in C.C.

No.1213/2007 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Attingal. The second accused is no more. The learned

Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Section 498A of

Indian Penal Code, based on a private complaint filed by the

second respondent.       Now, it is submitted on behalf of the

petitioners that the entire disputes between the first petitioner

and the second respondent have already been settled and the

second respondent has also sworn an affidavit which is produced

along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure 3. Therefore, the prayer in this

Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in C.C. No.1213/2007

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal.

      2. Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned

counsel for the second respondent.

      3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT 108, the

Apex Court held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the

Crl.M.C. NO. 2466 of 2014           2


purpose      of   quashing,   particularly offences   arising  from

commercial, financial, mercantile, civil partnership or such like

transactions or the offences arising out of matrimonial relating to

dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

entire dispute. In these category of cases, High Court may quash

criminal proceedings, if in its view, because of the compromise

between the offender and the victim, the possibility of a

conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case

would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the

criminal case despite full and complete settlement and

compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court may

consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation

of criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process

of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim

and wrong-doer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer

to the above question is in affirmative the High Court shall be

well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings.

Crl.M.C. NO. 2466 of 2014         3


      4. The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed an offence punishable under Section 498A of the

Indian Penal Code. Now as submitted by both sides, the entire

dispute between the first petitioner and the second respondent

has already been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the

second respondent has also stated that the second respondent

does not want to prosecute the criminal case filed against the

petitioners. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings      pending  against   the   petitioners  in  C.C.No.

1213/2007 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Attingal, can be quashed by this Court invoking the

powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in

the light of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian

Sing's case supra.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C. No.1213/2007 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal is quashed.

                            O R D E R

      This revision is preferred against the order of the Family

Court, Kasaragod in M.C.260/05.           The wife moved an

application for maintenance and the court below refused

maintenance on the ground that she is living separately

without reason. It is against that the wife has come up in

revision.

      2.   I had gone through the pleadings, the evidence and

also heard the learned counsel for the both the sides. The

Family Court had been highly technical in its approach because

the case of the petitioner/wife appears to be that the date is

15.6.2004 whereas in evidence she has stated it as 16.5.2004.

It is taken note of as a serious contradiction and the court has

acted upon it.

      3.   The young couple were living in the matrimonial

home with aged parents. The house is only a thatched one.

The wife would contend that there was a demand for dowry

R.P.(F.C.) NO. 136      OF 2006
                                -:2:-

from the part of the husband and his mother which her family

could not meet.     It is her case that she was subjected to

cruelty.  There was no complaint for her to start with but

according to her as the harm increased she had to live

separately.

      4.   The husband would contend the wife was not

interested in looking after his parents and she wanted to have

a separate residence of her own for which he did not agree.

It has to be stated at the age of 80 there is a limit for a

father-in-law to create nuisance and the wife is also now not

living happily in a better place but equally under the very

circumstances in her parental home.        Therefore when the

evidence is analysed I do not find any necessity for this lady to

utter falsehood and live separately from the husband.         In

matrimonial matters the courts have to be more realistic

rather than relying upon the technical field of evidence Act for

the reason that it is the life of two persons that is under peril

R.P.(F.C.) NO. 136      OF 2006
                                -:3:-

which not only affects them but the society as a whole. Under

the Indian concept ordinarily a wife will not be interested to

stay separately unless there is some harm done to her. Even

though there are exceptions here and there the ordinary wear

and tire of matrimonial life is normally bone by some of the

ladies. But in so far as this case is concerned that is not the

circumstances and the wife had left the matrimonial home only

on account of her difficulty to continue her residence therein.

Therefore she is entitled to claim maintenance for her living

separately.

      5.   So far as the quantum is concerned it is argued that

the husband is having two auto rickshaws and landed

properties and lottery sales but the only accepted thing is the

sale of lottery tickets from where the husband claims about

Rs.70 to 80 as income per day. Admittedly the disabled aged

parents have to be looked after by the husband and at this

point of time the wife is living separately which means that he

                               -:4:-

has to spend more time to look after the things of the parents.

So taking into consideration these factum I am inclined to fix

the monthly income between Rs.2,000/- and Rs.2,500/- and

award a sum of Rs. 600/- as maintenance to the wife.       The

said maintenance shall be paid from the date of petition.

     R.P.(F.C.) is disposed of accordingly.

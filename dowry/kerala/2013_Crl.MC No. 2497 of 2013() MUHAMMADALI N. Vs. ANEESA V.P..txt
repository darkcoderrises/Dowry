                 Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013
                  -------------------------------
          Dated this the 21st day of June, 2013.


                          O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance   of   the   petitioners,     who     are accused in

C.C.No.1652 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Hosdurg, which is a case instituted upon the police

report for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 148,

323, 498-A r/w 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all

further proceedings in the above C.C., as the matter is

settled out of court.

        2.  The allegation in the above case is that, the

petitioners who are the accused in C.C.No.1652/12 which

is instituted on the basis of report in Crime No.427/12 is

that the first petitioner herein married the de facto

complainant on 11.8.2002 in accordance with the custom

                              2
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


prevailing among the Muslim community and while they

were living together, difference of opinion occurred and

according to the de facto complainant, the petitioners

misappropriated an amount of `1,50,000/- and 20

sovereign of gold and demanded more money and gold

ornaments from the de facto complainant and thereby the

petitioners, who are the accused, have committed the

offences punishable under sections 147, 148, 323, 498 A

r/w 149 of IPC. Now the case of the petitioners is that

the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

as well as the 1st respondent.     I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.      The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case,

the matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

                               3
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


         5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received     from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is

the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance

against them.

         6.    I    have carefully considered   the  above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under sections 147,

148, 323, 498 A r/w 149 of IPC, which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

                                  4
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


pertinent to note that though such offences are involved,

the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter.              From the

submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture,

it is relevant to note the decisions of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] and Jitendra Raghuvanshi and

Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1)

KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:     the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
         has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

                                 5
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases      power   to  quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend on
         the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences      arising    from    commercial,
         financial, mercandile, civil, partnership or
         such like transactions or the offences
         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry
         etc. or the family disputes where the wrong
         is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute.     In this category of cases, High
         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
         its view, because of the compromise
         between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak
         and continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to
         him by not quashing the criminal case
         despite full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

Further, in       Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case, the Apex

Court has held as follows:-

                 "7.    It is not in    dispute that
         matrimonial      disputes   have   been   on

                                  6
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


         considerable increase in recent times
         resulting in filing of complaints under
         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only
         against the husband but also against the
         relatives of the husband. The question is
         when such matters are resolved either by
         the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
         home or by mutual settlement of other
         pending disputes for which both the sides
         approached the High Court and jointly
         prayed      for  quashing   of  the    criminal
         proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the
         wife under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C.,
         whether the prayer can be declined on the
         sole ground that since the offences are
         non-compoundable under Section 320 of
         the Code, it would be impermissible for the
         court to quash the criminal proceedings or
         FIR or complaint.
                8. It is not in dispute that in the case
         on hand subsequent to the filing of the
         criminal complaint under Sections 498A
         and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the
         Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help
         and     intervention   of  family    members,
         friends     and   well-wishers,  the    parties
         concerned have amicably settled their
         differences         and       executed       a
         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto,
         the appellants filed the said compromise
         before the Trial Court with a request to
         place the same on record and to drop the
         criminal proceedings against the appellants
         herein.     It is also not in dispute that in
         additional to the mutual settlement arrived
         at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also
         filed an affidavit stating that she did not
         wish to pursue the criminal proceedings
         against the appellants and fully supported
         the contents of the settlement deed. It is
         the grievance of the appellants that no only

                                 7
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


         the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the
         parties but also the High Court failed toe
         exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482
         of the Code only on the ground that the
         criminal proceedings relate to the offences
         punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of
         IPC     which    are  non-compoundable      in
         nature."
                "12. In our view, it is the duty of the
         Courts to encourage genuine settlements
         of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when
         the same are on considerable increase.
         Even if the offences are non-compoundable,
         if they relate to matrimonial disputes and
         the Court is satisfied that the parties have
         settled the same amicably and without any
         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of
         securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the
         Code would not be a bar to the exercise of
         power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
         subsequent criminal proceedings.
                13.    There has been an outburst of
         matrimonial disputes in recent times. The
         institution    of  marriage     occupies    an
         important place and it has an important
         role to play in the society. Therefore, every
         effort should be made in the interest of the
         individuals in order to enable them to settle
         down in life and live peacefully.      If the
         parties ponder over their defaults and
         terminate     their  disputes   amicably    by
         mutual agreement instead of fighting it out
         in a Court of law, in order to do complete
         justice in the matrimonial matters, the
         Courts should be less hesitant in exercising
         its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to
         state that the power under Section 482
         should be exercised sparingly and with
         circumspection only when the Court is
         convinced, on the basis of material on
         record, that allowing the proceedings to

                              8
Crl.M.C.No.2497 of 2013


         continue would be an abuse of the process
         of the Court or that the ends of justice
         require that the proceedings ought to be
         quashed."

Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings

are initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose

among the parties and both the disputes are now

amicably settled between the parties. According to me, in

the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement

arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decisions will be squarely applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote

such settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go

on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

                                9

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Crl.M.C.can be allowed granting the relief as

sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further proceedings pending against the petitioners in

C.C.No.1652 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg.

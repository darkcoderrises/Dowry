    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.1292 of 2014
    ==============================
          Dated this, 06th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



     This is an application filed by the petitioner who is the

accused in C.C.No.47/09 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-II, Kollam, for quashing the proceedings

after recording composition under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent, a case was

registered as Crime No.524/08 of Kollam West Police Station,

alleging offence under Section 324 of Indian Penal Code and

after investigation, Annexure-II final report was filed before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kollam, which

was taken on file as C.C.No. 47/09 and that is pending before

that court. It is also mentioned in the petition that in respect

of the same incident on the basis of the statement given by

the present petitioner, another crime was registered as Crime

No.523/08 against the present de facto complainant and

others and that was also charge sheeted and taken on file as

C.C.No.48/09 that is also pending before the same court.

Crl.M.C.No.1292 of 2014         :  2 :

Now, both the parties have settled the case. No purpose will

be served by proceeding with the prosecution in view of the

settlement arrived at between the parties.               Since offences

alleged are non-compoundable in nature, they could not file

application before the court below for compounding the case.

So, petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this

court seeking the following relief:

           "To quash all further proceedings in CC No.47/2009 on the

    file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kollam, as it is an

    abuse of process of court."

       3.   Second respondent appeared through Counsel and

filed Annexure-I affidavit stating that the matter has been

settled between the parties and he has no objection in

quashing the case.

       4.   The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that except the case and

counter case registered in respect of the incident, there is no

other case against the petitioner and he has no criminal

antecedent as well but, opposed the application.

     5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by second respondent, Crime No.524/08 was

registered by Kollam West Police and after investigation,

Crl.M.C.No.1292 of 2014          :   3 :

Annexure-II final report was filed and it was taken on file as

C.C.No.47/09 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-II, Kollam, and that was pending before that court.

It is also an admitted fact that in respect of the same incident,

on the basis of the statement given by the present petitioner,

another crime was registered as Crime No.523/08 and after

investigation, final report was filed in that case also against the

present de facto complainant and three others and that was

pending as C.C.No.48/09 before the same court. The matter

has been settled between both the parties now. There was

some dispute arose between the parties to the litigation and on

account of that the present cases have been registered.

However, the matter has been settled between the parties and

the relationship has been restored due to the intervention of

relatives and well wishers.

       6.   In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

       The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
       summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing in
       criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its
       inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
       given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
       S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
       no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
       with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure
       the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

Crl.M.C.No.1292 of 2014          :  4 :

       any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
       proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
       offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend
       on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category
       can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,
       the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
       gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
       depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
       be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
       and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
       not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
       Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender
       in relation to the offences under special statutes like
       Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by
       public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
       provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
       involving such offences.      But the criminal cases having
       overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on
       different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
       offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
       partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising
       out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
       disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
       nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
       this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
       between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction
       is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
       put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
       injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
       case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
       with the victim.      In other words, the High Court must
       consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest
       of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
       continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to
       abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise
       between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the
       ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
       end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
       affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction
       to quash the criminal proceeding."




       7.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that the case and

Crl.M.C.No.1292 of 2014    :   5 :

counter case registered in respect of the same incident

between the parties have been settled and the earlier

relationship has been restored between them and no purpose

will be served by proceeding with the case and possibility of

conviction is remote, in view of the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties, this court feels that it is a fit

case where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

       So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.47/09 (Crime No.524/08 of Kollam West Police

Station) now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, No-II, Kollam, as against the petitioner is quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

magistrate court for further necessary action in this regard.

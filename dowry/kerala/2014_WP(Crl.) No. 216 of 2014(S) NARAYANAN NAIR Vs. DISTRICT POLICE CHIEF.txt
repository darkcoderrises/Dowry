        ANTONY DOMINIC & ALEXANDER THOMAS, JJ.
        ===============================
                      WP(Crl.) No. 216 of 2014
                 ====================

              Dated this the 3rd day of June, 2014

                             J U D G M E N T

Antony Dominic, J.

       Petitioner is the father of Sreelekshmi, the alleged detenue.

He has filed this writ petition alleging that his daughter is being

illegally detained by the 3rd respondent, whose parents are

respondents 4 and 5. On an earlier occasion, making almost

similar allegations, the petitioner has filed WP(Crl) No.104/14,

where instructions were obtained from the learned Government

Pleader, which revealed that the detenue and the 3rd respondent

were in love and got married at Vandiperiyar and that they were

both living in Bangalore. On that basis, the writ petition was

closed by Ext.P4 judgment. Subsequently, this writ petition has

been again filed by the petitioner alleging that on 9/5/14, he

received a phone call from the 4th respondent, the father of the 3rd

respondent, threatening the petitioner with dire consequences if

he makes any further enquiry about his daughter.           It is also

alleged that the 4th respondent made a demand for `15 lakhs and

50 sovereigns of gold as dowry, if the petitioner wants to see the

W.P.(Crl.) No.216/14
                                 : 2   :



detenue. On this basis, he suspects that his daughter is still kept

under detention.     In these circumstances, this writ petition is

again filed with a prayer for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus.

      2.    On the filing of this writ petition, this Court directed the

learned Government Pleader to obtain instructions in the matter

and accordingly instructions have been obtained from the 2nd

respondent which shows that the detenue and the 3rd respondent

were classmates at Bangalore and that they fell in love and

wanted to get married, which was not approved by the petitioner.

Finally, the detenue went with the 3rd respondent to his house and

on their compulsion, his parents solemnized the marriage

between the two at Elappara on 15/9/13. It is also stated that the

marriage was registered under the Common Rules at the Elappara

Grama Panchayat on 28/9/13 and that on 1/10/13, the same was

again registered at the S.N.D.P. Branch.             It is stated that

thereafter the couple left for Bangalore and that the alleged

detenue is employed as a Nurse at Colombia Asia Hospital,

Bangalore.

      Evidently therefore, this case does not involve any illegal

detention of the alleged detenue and in so far as the other

W.P.(Crl.) No.216/14
                               :   3  :



allegations made by the petitioner are concerned, those are

matters which are outside the scope of a writ petition with a

prayer for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, this

writ petition is closed.

              Crl.M.C. NO. 3325 of 2012
          ----------------------------------------
         Dated this the 28th day of November, 2012

                         ORDER


          Petitioners are the accused in a pending case

numbered as C.C.No.702 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam. Petitioners stand indicted

for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 406 and 403

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. That crime

was registered on the complaint filed by the second

respondent, who is the wife of the first petitioner and

daughter-in-law of the second petitioner. Matrimonial cruelty

by her husband and his father, the accused, demanding

dowry, was the crux of the complaint for registration of the

crime. Now the parties have settled the disputes and a decree

for divorce of the spouses on mutual consent has been

passed by the Family Court, Thrissur, is the submission of the

counsel for petitioners, which is endorsed by the counsel

Crl.M.C. NO. 3325 of 2012       2



appearing for the second respondent. An affidavit sworn to

by the second respondent is also produced, wherein she

avers that she has no more grievance against the petitioners

and she does not wish to prosecute them. The aforesaid case

proceeded     against    the petitioners  has    arisen  from

matrimonial disputes between the first petitioner and the

second respondent, the spouses.         Where the criminal

proceedings have arisen from matrimonial disputes, even if it

involves non compoundable offences, settlement effected by

the parties can be taken due note of and given effect to for

quashing such proceedings. That has been so held by the

Apex Court in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab [2012 (4)

KLT 108 (SC)]. Further more even if the proceedings are

continued in view of the settlement effected by the parties it

is unlikely to lead to conviction of the petitioners or any of

them. That may cause only wastage of the precious time of

the court. Taking into account the aforesaid aspects as well,

the criminal proceedings against the petitioners/accused in

Crl.M.C. NO. 3325 of 2012         3



C.C. No.702 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kunnamkulam, are quashed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

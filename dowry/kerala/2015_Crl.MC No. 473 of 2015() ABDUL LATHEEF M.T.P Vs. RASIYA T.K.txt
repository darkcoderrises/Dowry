                Dated this the 1st day of April, 2015

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.375/2010 of

Chittarikkal Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioner has come up with this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A2 FIR and

Annexure-A3 Final Report in Crime No.375/2010 of

Chittarikkal Police Station as against the petitioner and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1054/2012 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,

Hosdurg, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

Crl.M.C.473/2015
                              : 2 :



his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto  complainant,     who    is  the    1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

Crl.M.C.473/2015
                                : 3 :



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A2

FIR and Annexure-A3 Final Report in Crime No.375/2010 of

Chittarikkal Police Station as against the petitioner and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1054/2012 pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg

are hereby quashed.

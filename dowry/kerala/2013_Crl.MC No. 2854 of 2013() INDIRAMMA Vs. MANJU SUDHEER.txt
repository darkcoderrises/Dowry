         Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
         --------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 12th day of July, 2013

                                ORDER

        As all the cases arose out of the issues connected with

the matrimonial dispute between Sudheeran, who is the

husband and Manju Sudheeran, who is the wife and the

petitioners in the above Crl.M.Cs. are the relatives of the said

Sudheeran and in all the cases the respondent, who is none

other than the wife, is the de facto complainant.

     2.   The above cases are heard together and disposed of

by this common order.

     3.   The facts involved in the above cases are that the

marriage between one Sudheeran and Manju Sudheeran

solemnized on 05/11/2003 in accordance with the rights and

customs prevailed among the Hindu religion and thereafter

while they were residing as husband and wife difference of

opinion arose among the spouses mainly connected with the

domestic issue and also connected with the dowry. Thus, upon

the complaint preferred by the wife, namely, Manju Sudheeran

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                              :-2-:


Crime No.93 of 2011 was registered in the Kodanad Police

Station for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 &

34 of IPC, which eventually resulted in instituting C.C.No.983

of 2011 in the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Perumbavoor. The very same wife initiated proceedings under

Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act alleging that

the accused, who are the husband and his mother committed

offence punishable under Section 31 of Protection of the above

Act, Crime No.79 of 2010 has also been registered in the

Kodanad Police Station and on the basis of the report therein

C.C.No.504 of 2010 is also instituted in the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor.        Besides the above two

crimes, Crime No.107 of 2010 was registered in the Kodanad

Police Station alleging offences punishable under Sections

498-A, 323 & 324 of IPC and the police, on completing the

investigation, filed a final report in the court below. Based

upon which C.C.No.460 of 2010 was instituted in the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor. Thus,

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                              :-3-:


Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013 directed against the

proceedings respectively in C.C.Nos.983 of 2011, 504 of 2010

and 460 of 2010, under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all proceedings pending against the accused therein,

who are the petitioners in the above Crl.M.Cs. on the ground

that the matter is settled out of court.

     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 1st respondent in the above three petitions. I have also

heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   Both the counsel for the petitioners and the

respondent/ de facto complainant submitted that the matter is

settled for ever on the basis of the amicable settlement arrived

at between the parties. Annexure-A3 is the affidavit filed in all

the above cases which duly sworn into by the de facto

complainant.

     6. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that,

during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is settled

amicably between the parties which is the subject matter of

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                              :-4-:


the   above   cases.   Therefore,    the continuation  of   the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     7. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent who on the

basis of specific instruction received    from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

     8. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A3 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved

in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the

above case are only under Sections 341, 323, 498(A), 324 & 34

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


of IPC and Section 31 of the Protection of Women from

Domestic Violence Act, 2005 which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 1st respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant       has    no      further      grievance         against    the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decisions of

the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State

of   Punjab       [2012(4)      KLT      108(SC)]            and      Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817 (SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                                         :-6-:


           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

           guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

           ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

           any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

           the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

           no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

           for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

           arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

           partnership or such like transactions or the offences

           arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

           personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

           quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

           compromise between the offender and victim, the

           possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

           continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

           oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

           caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

           full and complete settlement and compromise with the

           victim........"

Further, in      Jitendra Raghuvanshi's case,         the Apex Court has held as

follows:-

                    "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                                   :-7-:


        have been on considerable increase in recent times

        resulting in filing of complaints under Sections 498A and

        406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but also against

        the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

        matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin

        the matrimonial home or by mutual settlement of other

        pending disputes for which both the sides approached the

        High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the criminal

        proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

        Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can

        be declined on the sole ground that since the offences are

        non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code, it

        would be impermissible for the court to quash the

        criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

              8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand

        subsequent to the filing of the criminal complaint under

        Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the

        Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

        intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers,

        the parties concerned have amicably settled their

        differences   and   executed    a  compromise/settlement.

        Pursuant    thereto,    the  appellants    filed   the  said

        compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place

        the same on record and to drop the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants herein. It is also not in dispute that

        in additional to the mutual settlement arrived at by the

        parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating

        that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings

        against the appellants and fully supported the contents of

        the settlement deed. It is the grievance of the appellants

        that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                                   :-8-:


        parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

        jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the

        ground that the criminal proceedings relate to the

        offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC

        which are non-compoundable in nature."

               "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to

        encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,

        particularly, when the same are on considerable increase.

        Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if they relate

        to matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied that the

        parties have settled the same amicably and without any

        pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of

        justice, Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the

        exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the

        subsequent criminal proceedings.

               13.  There has been an outburst of matrimonial

        disputes in recent times.     The institution of marriage

        occupies an important place and it has an important role

        to play in the society. Therefore, every effort should be

        made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable

        them to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the

        parties ponder over their defaults and terminate their

        disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of

        fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete

        justice in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be

        less hesitant in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction.

        It is trite to state that the power under Section 482

        should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

        only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material

        on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue

        would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                                  :-9-:


        ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to be

        quashed."


Considering the particular facts and circumstances in this

case, it can be seen further that the criminal proceedings are

initiated consequent to the matrimonial dispute arose among

the parties and both the disputes are now amicably settled

between the parties. According to me, in the light of the facts

and circumstances         involved      in the present case       and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decisions will be squarely

applicable in the present case. According to me, as the parties

to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution, resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

Crl.M.C.Nos.2854, 2855 & 2862 of 2013
                              :-10-:


following the decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

     In the result, the above Crl.M.Cs. are disposed of

quashing all the proceedings pending against the petitioners/

accused and the FIR and reports thereon in C.C.Nos.983 of

2011, 504 of 2010 and 460 of 2010 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor.

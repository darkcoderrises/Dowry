             -------------------------------------------
                    Crl.M.C. No.4509 of 2010
           ----------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 5th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER

      This petition is filed u/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash Annexure-I

complaint pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Kochi as C.C. No.1098/2005 by invoking the inherent

jurisdiction. The above case was filed by the 2nd respondent

alleging cruelty by the husband and relatives of the husband.

After considering the entire materials on record, the learned

Magistrate took cognizance under Section 498A IPC only

against the 1st accused.     The learned Magistrate specifically

found that no offence is made out against the petitioners herein.

On 6.3.2009, the defacto complainant, 2nd respondent was

examined as PW1. Thereafter, she filed C.M.P.No.1081/2009 to

implead the petitioners herein as additional accused 2 to 8 in the

above case. According to the petitioners, there was no evidence

adduced in the trial court to invoke Section 319 Cr.PC at that

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10             2

stage and when there is no materials to invoke Section 319

Cr.P.C., the cognizance of the offence taken against the

petitioners is a mere abuse of the process of the Court.

Hence, the petitioners pray to invoke the inherent jurisdiction

u/s.482 Cr.P.C.

      2.    The 2nd respondent's allegation in Annexure-1

complaint was that the petitioner was married the 2nd

respondent on 8.11.1993 at Pathumthirumal Devaswom

temple, Palluruthy as per Hindu customary rites.        In the

wedlock, two daughters were born to them. While residing so,

the accused ill-treated her demanding more amount as dowry.

Subsequently, the marriage was divorced.            In such

circumstances, she filed Annexure-I complaint against the

accused.

      3.    The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

contended that Annexure-IV order of the learned Magistrate is

unsustainable in law and passed without considering the

evidence.      Section 319 Cr.P.C can be invoked only in

exceptional circumstances. The learned Magistrate declined

to take cognizance of the offence earlier. There is no oral or

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10                 3

documentary evidence adduced by PW1 to invoke the powers

vested in Section 319 Cr.P.C. The learned counsel for the

petitioners relied decisions in Aboobakar Musalliar v. Inspector

of Police [ILR 2009(4) Ker 200], Preeti Gupta v. State of

Jharkhand [2010 (2) KLD 391 (SC)], Hardeep Singh v. State of

Punjab and others [ (2014) 3 SCC 92].

      4.    The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent strongly resisted the above contention and

contended that the oral evidence adduced by PW1 is

sufficient to invoke Section 319 Cr.P.C. The overt act of the

petitioners was specifically mentioned by PW1, while she was

adducing evidence in the trial Court. Therefore, the totality of

the evidence shows that the petitioners are also to be tried

together with the 1st accused.

      5.    In the light of the above argument, I refer Section

319 Cr.P.C., which reads as follows:

            "319. Power to proceed against other persons
            appearing to be guilty of offence.- (1) Where, in
            the course of any inquiry into, or trial of, an
            offence, it appears from the evidence that any
            persons not being the accused has committed any
            offence for which such person could be tried
            together with the accused, the Court may proceed
            against such person for the offence which he

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10                   4

            appears to have committed.
            (2) Where such person is not attending the Court,
            he may be arrested or summoned, as the
            circumstances of the case may require, for the
            purpose aforesaid.
            (3) Any person attending the Court although not
            under arrest or upon a summons, may be
            detained by such Court for the purpose of the
            inquiry into, or trial of, the offence which he
            appears to have committed.
            (4) Where the Court proceeds against any person
            shall be commenced then-
            (a) the proceedings in respect of such person
            shall be commenced afresh, and witnesses re-
            heard.
            (b) subject to the provisions of clause (a), the case
            may proceed as if such person had been an
            accused person when the Court took cognizance
            of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was
            commenced."

A close reading of Section 319 Cr.P.C. shows that if on the

evidence collected or produced in the course of any inquiry or

trial of an offence, the Court is prima facie satisfied that such

person has committed any offence for which he can be tried

with other accused, in such circumstances, the Court may

proceed against such persons for the alleged offence, which

he appears to have committed such offence. Therefore, there

is no bar for issuing process against such persons.               That

settled legal position is explained in Aboobacker Mussaliar's

case (supra), which held as follows: (para 18):

          "18. Evidence envisaged in Section 319 is the evidence

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10                        5

          tendered during trial of the case if the offence is triable by
          a Court of Session. The primary requirement for invoking
          Section 319 is that it should appear to the Court from the
          evidence collected during trial or in the inquiry that some
          other person who is not arraigned as an accused in that
          case has committed an offence and that person could be
          tried together with the accused already arraigned. It is not
          sufficient that the Court entertained some doubt about the
          involvement of another person in the offence who is not
          an accused, on the evidence tendered. On the evidence
          adduced before the Court, the Court should satisfy that
          the person who is not arraigned before his as an accused
          appeared to have committed the offence and also that he
          could be tried along with the accused already facing trial."



Another Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Hardeep

Singh's case (supra) held as follows: (para117.1 & 117.2)

             "117.1. In Dharam Pal case, the Constitution
             Bench has already held that after committal,
             cognizance of an ofence can be taken against a
             person not named as an accused but against
             whom materials are available from the papers
             filed by the police after completion of the
             investigation. Such cognizance can be taken
             under Section 193 Cr.P.C. and the Sessions
             Judge need not wait till "evidence" under
             Section 319 Cr.P.C. becomes available for
             summoning an additional accused.
             117.2. Section 319 Cr.P.C. significantly uses
             two expressions that have to be taken note of
             i.s, (1) inquriy (2) trial. As a trial commences
             after framing of charge, an inquiry can only be
             understood to be a pre-trial inquiry. Inquiries
             under Sections 200, 201, 202 Cr.P.C and under
             Section 398 Cr.P.C. are species of the inquiry
             contemplated by Section 319 Cr.P.C. Materials
             coming before the court in course of such
             inquiries can be used for corroboration of the
             evidence recorded in the court after the trial
             commences, for the exercise of power under
             Section 319 Cr.P.C., and also to add an
             accused whose name has been shown in
             Column 2 of the charge-sheet."

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10                    6

Therefore, the averment of PW1 did not disclose any specific

overt act against accused 2 to 8. There is no documentary

evidence produced before trial Court for invoking Section 319

Cr.P.C. Even though PW1 stated that A2 to A8 assaulted her

with hands, the details, as to whether she sustained any

injury or undergone any treatment from any hospital are not

disclosed in her oral testimony. The vague allegation itself is

not sufficient to invoke Section 319 Cr.P.C. Apex Court in

Preeti Gupta's case (supra) held as follows:

           "Before parting with this case, we would like to
           observe that a serious relook of the entire
           provision is warranted by the legislation.    It is
           also a matter of common knowledge that
           exaggerated    versions   of  the    incident  are
           reflected in a large number of complaints. The
           tendency of over implication is also reflected in a
           very large number of cases. The criminal trials
           lead to immense sufferings for all concerned.
           Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also not
           be able to wipe out the deep scars of suffering or
           ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these
           complaints have not only flooded the courts but
           also have led to enormous social unrest affecting
           peace, harmony and happiness of the society"

Considering the evidence adduced by PW1 during enquiry, I

am of the opinion that evidence itself is not sufficient to attract

Section 319 Cr.P.C.          Therefore, it is a mere abuse of the

process of the Court. The inherent power can be invoked by

Crl.M.C.No.4509//10                    7

the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to

give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of

the process of Court to otherwise to secure the ends of

justice. While exercising such jurisdiction,this Court cannot

ordinarily analyse the evidence adduced by the petitioner or

cannot conduct an enquiry with regard to the reliability of the

evidence in the alleged facts. Prima facie satisfaction of the

case is sufficient. Apex Court in State of Haryana V. Bhajanlal

[1992 SCC (Crl) 426] pointed out that:

                  "where the allegations made in the FIR or
            complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable
            on the basis of which no prudent person can ever
            reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient
            ground for proceeding against the accused, the
            proceedings are liable to be quashed".

Therefore, the cognizance taken u/s.498A IPC against A2 to

A8 is hereby quashed by invoking the inherent jurisdiction.

This will not affect the case of 1st accused pending before that

Court.

      Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the above observation.

                Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 27th day of August, 2014.


                         O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioners, who are the accused in

C.C.No.1465 of 2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Sasthamcotta, which is a case instituted upon the

police report [in Crime No.543 of 2008 of Sasthamcotta

Police Station] for the offences punishable under Sections

452, 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash

Annexure-B final report/charge sheet in the above crime

and all subsequent proceedings pursuant to the above

calendar case, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that on

4.9.2008 at 3 p.m., the petitioners/accused along with 1st

accused entered into the office room of the 2nd respondent/

de facto complainant, who is a teacher and a lady, used

Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                               2

obscene words against her and thereafter threatened to

cause death of the 3rd respondent/injured, while interfered

in the incident and thereby committed the offences as

alleged by the prosecution.         Now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.       The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that during the pendency of the above case, the

matter is settled amicably between the parties to the

dispute, which was the subject matter of the above case, as

per the affidavits sworn into by the 2nd and 3rd respondents.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above

case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5.      The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the de facto complainant and victim

Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                               3

respectively, do not intends to proceed any further against

the petitioners and they have no grievance against the

petitioners.

         6.    I    have carefully considered   the    above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 452, 294

(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent

to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                                    4

the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant and the victim have no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                  "57. The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the      power given  to a     criminal court     for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But  the    criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the

Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                                   5

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

Crl.M.C.No.4911 of 2014
                              6

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.       Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-B final report/charge sheet in Crime No.543 of

2008 of Sasthamcotta Police Station and all subsequent

proceedings pending against the petitioners pursuant to

C.C.No.1465 of 2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Sasthamcotta.

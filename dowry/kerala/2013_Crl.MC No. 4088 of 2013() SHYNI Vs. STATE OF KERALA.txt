           Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Petitioners are the 3rd and 5th accused in Crime

No.121/2007 of Venmony Police Station registered under Section

498(A), 342 r/w 34 I.P.C. Now the matter is pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chengannur as C.C

No.33/2008. The allegation in brief is that the petitioners along with

other accused harassed the defacto complainant demanding more

dowry and meted out physical cruelty to her. Petitioners pleaded

innocence. According to the petitioners, 3rd accused was in gulf

country for some time, that is why she could not appear before the

learned Magistrate. The 5th accused failed to appear for the reason

that he was residing at Wayanad and he went to Bombay in

connection with job. Considering the merit of the matter, following

directions are issued :-

                  The warrant issued in C.C No.33/2008 by

Crl.M.C.No.4088 of 2013             2




            the    learned    Magistrate  shall  stand   as

            withdrawn. Petitioners shall surrender before

            the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I,

            Chengannur and move for bail in the above

            matter. In that event, learned Magistrate shall

            consider the bail application on merits on the

            date of filing itself.

      Petition is disposed of accordingly.

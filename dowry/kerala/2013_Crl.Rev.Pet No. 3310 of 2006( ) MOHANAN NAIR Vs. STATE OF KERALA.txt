                   -------------------------------

                             O R D E R

      The revision petitioner herein is the first accused in

C.C.No.223 of 1999 of the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Pathanamthitta, which was instituted upon a police

report filed in Crime No.320/98 of Konni police station against the

accused for the offence punishable under Section 498(A) read

with Section 34 IPC. The trial court by judgment dated

22.12.2001 in C.C.No.223 of 1999 found that the first accused/

the revision petitioner herein is guilty and accordingly he is

sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and

to pay a fine of Rs.3,000/- and in default of payment of fine

directed him to undergo simple imprisonment for one month. A2,

who is the mother of the revision petitioner is acquitted.

Challenging the above conviction and sentence the revision

petitioner had preferred Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2002 before the

court Additional District and Sessions Judge(Adhoc) Court-I,

Pathanamthitta and the lower appellate Court by its judgment

dated 24.02.2006 dismissed the appeal confirming the conviction

Crl.R.P.No.3310 of 2006           2

and sentence on the revision petitioner as imposed by the trial

court. Challenging the above judgments of the courts below and

the conviction and the sentence imposed on the revision

petitioner, he preferred the present revision petition.

        2. Now both the counsel for the petitioner as well as the

respondent submitted that besides the above proceedings,

proceedings were also pending before the Family Court,

accordingly divorce was granted and as part of the settlement the

defacto complainant who is the additional 2nd respondent herein

as also agreed to withdraw all proceedings initiated against the

revision petitioner and she has no further grievance against the

revision petitioner.     It is under the above circumstances the

defacto complainant has filed      Crl.M.A No.83 of 2013 to get

impleaded in the present revision petition, though the revision

petitioner has filed Crl.M.A 8040 of 2012 to implead the defacto

complainant. In terms of the affidavit filed by the defacto

complainant in support of her petition to get impleaded in the

revision petition and in the light of the submissions made by the

Crl.R.P.No.3310 of 2006           3

counsels for the petitioner as well as the respondent, it is crystal

clear that Crime No.320/98 of Konny police station was

registered for the offence punishable under Section 498 (A) r/w

Section 34 IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act at the

instance of the additional 2nd respondent who was the defacto

complainant and during the pendency of the case that after the

judgment of the courts below and while the revision petition is

pending before this Court, the matter is settled between the

parties and accordingly as part of the settlement the divorce

petition filed at the instance of the defacto complainant was

allowed and by the same settlement the defacto complainant has

also agreed to withdraw all criminal proceedings against the

revision petitioner and as such she has no further grievance

against the petitioner.

        3. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute particularly in view of the decision of

the Apex Court reported in Jian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] the interest of justice requires to

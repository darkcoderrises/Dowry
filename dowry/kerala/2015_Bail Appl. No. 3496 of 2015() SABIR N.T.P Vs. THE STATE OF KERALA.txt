                            O R D E R




      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2.    Petitioner along with the co-accused is alleged

to have committed the offence under Section 498A of

Indian Penal Code.

      3.    The prosecution case is that the petitioner and

others subjected his wife to cruelty demanding more

dowry.

      4.    Heard.

      5.    Since it is a family matter the attempt of the

court should be to restore harmony to the family. Granting

anticipatory bail to the petitioner will only facilitate it. So

I am inclined to grant the prayer.

      In the result, this application is allowed.

      1.    The petitioner shall be released on bail after

interrogation on his executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-

(Rupees Twenty five thousand only) each with two solvent

sureties for the like sum each if he is arrested by the

B.A. No.3496 of 2015                2

police in connection with this case.

      2.     He shall appear before the investigating officer

for interrogation if he is so required by him in writing.

      3.     He shall not get themselves involved in any

other criminal case while he is on bail.

      4.     He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence

the witnesses.

      5.     He shall not destroy or tamper with evidence.

      In case of violation of any of the above conditions,

the learned Magistrate is empowered to cancel the bail in

accordance with law.

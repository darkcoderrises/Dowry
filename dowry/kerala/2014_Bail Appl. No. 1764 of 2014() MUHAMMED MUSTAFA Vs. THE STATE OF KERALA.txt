          Dated this the 13th day of March 2014


                           O R D E R


     Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1546/2013 of

Pattambi Police Station. The offences alleged against him

are punishable under Secs.307 and 498A IPC. It is alleged

that the petitioner subjected the de facto complainant to

physical and mental cruelty demanding dowry. It is further

alleged that on 27.12.2013 the petitioner poured kerosene

on the body of the de facto complainant and set her on fire.

She suffered 40% burn injuries. The petitioner has been in

custody since 2.1.2014.

     2.   Learned Public Prosecutor has strongly opposed

the petition stating that while the victim was breast feeding

her child the accused poured kerosene from behind and set

fire to her. It was only because another child operated the

motor and splashed water, the victim could survive. It is a

cruel and inhuman act, the learned Public Prosecutor

B.A. No.1764 of 2014

                              -: 2 :-

submits. I find, there is force in the submission made by the

learned Public Prosecutor that if the accused is released on

bail, it will affect the fair and proper trial.  It is further

submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the final

report has already been filed and that immediately after

committal, the trial itself can be proceeded with.

     3.    The nature of accusation and the severity of

punishment in case of conviction and the materials collected

in   support     of the   allegations   and  the   reasonable

apprehension of the accused tampering the evidence and

the apprehension of threat to the complainant are matters

to be gone into while considering the application for bail.

The materials available on record would prima facie show

that there is merit in the complaint lodged by the

complainant.

     4.    The prosecution contends that the accused is a

powerful person who would interfere in the course of

investigation and would also indulge in similar criminal

activity and that he would tamper with evidence and

threaten or terrorise the witnesses and would hamper

                               -: 3 :-

smooth investigation. Considering all these aspects, I am

not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.

           The bail application is hence, dismissed.

                         Crl.M.C. No.2642 of 2014
                         --------------------------------------
                  Dated this the 20th day of May, 2014.

                                      ORDER

            Petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.17 of 2007 of Marad

Police Station registered under Sections 498A, 506(i) and 406 of the

Indian Penal Code. The case is pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-V, Kozhikode. The petitioner is the husband of the defacto

complainant and the dispute pertains to demand of dowry and ornaments.

Petitioner failed to appear before the lower court on account of his

employment abroad.

       2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner

is prepared to surrender before the trial court and also that his absence

was not wilful. Therefore, it is requested on behalf of the petitioner that the

Magistrate may be directed to consider the bail application on the date of

his surrender itself. Considering the entire facts and circumstances, I find

that the request made by the learned counsel can be allowed.

            In the result, the petition is allowed.             In the event of the

petitioner surrendering before the trial court and moving for bail, the

Crl.MC No.2642/2014                 2

learned Magistrate shall consider the bail application on merits on the date

of his surrender itself.




                                           A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

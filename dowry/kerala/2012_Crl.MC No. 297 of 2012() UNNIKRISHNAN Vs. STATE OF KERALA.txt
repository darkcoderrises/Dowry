                  Crl.M.C.NO. 297 of 2012
             ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 06st day of November, 2012

                             ORDER

      Petitioners are the accused in a pending case, numbered as

CC No.1259 of 2007 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate, Chavakkad. They are prosecuted for the offence

publishable under Section 498 (A) read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. Crime in the above case was registered on a

complaint given by the wife of the 1st petitioner, 2nd respondent

imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment by the husband

and his close relatives demanding dowry. After indictment of the

petitioner for the aforesaid offence on the report filed by the

investigating agency and cognizance of the offence taken by the

magistrate, it is submitted, that the parties have settled and

resolved their disputes. On mutual consent the spouses have

also severed their matrimonial relationship under a decree of

divorce passed by the competent Family Court, is the further

submission. A certified copy of that decree is also produced.

Crl.M.C.NO. 297 of 2012            2




Learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent also endorses

the submissions made as above, submitting that the de facto

complainant/former wife is no longer interested in prosecuting

the petitioners. The Apex Court in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] has held that criminal cases

involving non-compoundable offences where such offences are

predominantly of civil flavour or arising from matrimonial

disputes, on settlement by the parties thereto, can be quashed

by this Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In view of the settlement

effected by the parties, it is also to be taken note that even if the

prosecution is continued against the petitioners/accused chances

of such prosecution leading to conviction of any of them are

remote. At best, that may result only in wastage of precious

time of the Court. Taking into account those aspects also, and

settlement effected by the parties, I find the proceedings against

the petitioners are liable to be quashed.

Crl.M.C.NO. 297 of 2012         3




     Criminal proceedings against petitioners/accused in C.C

No.1259 of 2007 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Chavakkad are quashed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

     Criminal Miscellaneous Case is disposed of.

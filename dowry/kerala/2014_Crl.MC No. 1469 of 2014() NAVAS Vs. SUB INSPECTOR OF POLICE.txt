                     Crl.M.C.No.1469 of 2014
                  ..................................................
             Dated this the 7th day of March, 2014.

                               O R D E R


     This  is an application            filed      by the accused in Crime

No.82/2006 of    Punalur          Police        Station           now pending as

C.C.No.1901/2012 on the file of the                         Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Punalur to quash the proceedings recording

the composition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners                   are

accused Nos.2 and 3 in Crime No.82/2006 and accused in

C.C.No.1901/2012 on the file of the                       Judicial First   Class

Magistrate   Court-III,     Punalur.          The case against the          first

accused was tried as C.C.No.652/2006 and since none of the

prosecution witnesses have supported the case, it was ended in

acquittal. Now the matter has been settled                           between the

injured/defacto complaint and the petitioners,                       who are the

remaining accused persons. No purpose will be served by

proceedings with the case on account of the settlement. Since

the offences alleged are non compoundable in nature, they

Crl.M.C.No.1469 of 2014                  2

could not move the court below for compounding the case. They

have no other option except to approach this court                       seeking

the following relief.

       For these and other grounds to be urged at the time of hearing
       this Honourable Court may be pleased to quash Annexure A1
       final report in Crime No.82/2006 of Punalur Police Station and
       all proceedings against the accused in C.C.No.1901/2012 on the
       files of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-III,
       Punalur.

      3. The second respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

and he has filed Annexure A6 affidavit stating that the matter

has been settled and he has no                  objection in         quashing the

proceedings.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed     by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners but opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that crime was registered on the

basis of a statement given by the second respondent as Crime

No.82/2006 of         Punalur police station and after investigation

Annexure A1 Final Report was filed and it was originally taken

on file as C.C.No.652/2006 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-III, Punalur. The case against the                      original

first accused was tried by that court and he was acquitted by

that court as per Annexure A4 judgment as none of the witnesses

Crl.M.C.No.1469 of 2014             3

have supported the case of the prosecution. A counter case was

registered in respect of the incident as Crime No.33/2006

which was taken on       file as C.C.No.657/2006 on the file of

the same court was also ended in acquittal as against all the

accused persons except the second accused             in view of the

settlement evidenced by Annexure A5 judgment. The second

respondent has filed an affidavit stating that the matter has

been settled between the parties and they are relatives as

well and due to the settlement, their family relationship has

been restored .

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

        "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
        pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
        footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
        the offences arising from commercial, financial
        mercantile,    civil,  partnership   or   such   like
        transactions   or    the  offences  arising  out   of
        matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family
        disputes where the wrong is basically private or
        personal in nature and the parties have resolved
        their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
        Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
        because of the compromise between the offender
        and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
        and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
        put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
        extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
        quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
        settlement and compromise with the victim.         In
        other words, the High Court must consider whether

Crl.M.C.No.1469 of 2014             4

        it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
        justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
        continuation of the criminal proceedings would
        tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
        settlement and compromise between the victim and
        wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
        justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
        an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is
        in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
        jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that parties to the dispute         are

relatives and the matter has been settled due to intervention of

family members and the family relationship has been restored

on account of the settlement and the case against the other

accused was ended in acquittal due to non support from the

prosecution witnesses in view of the settlement, this Court feels

that no purpose will be served by proceeding with the case as

it will be only judicial wastage of time and it is a fit case to

invoke Section 482 of the Code of Criminal procedure to quash

the proceedings to promote the family relationship that has

been restored on account of the settlement. So the application

is allowed and further proceedings in C.C.No.1901/12 (Crime

No.82/2006 of Punalur police station) pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur          as against

the petitioners is quashed.

Crl.M.C.No.1469 of 2014          5

      Office is directed to communicate         this order to the

concerned court for further necessary action.

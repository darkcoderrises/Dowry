                        ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                    ==================
                 Crl.M.C.Nos. 5813 & 5815 of 2014
                    ==================
              Dated this the 31st day of October, 2014
                              O R D E R

     These Criminal Miscellaneous Cases, seeking invocation of the

inherent powers conferred on this Court as per Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C. have been filed with the prayers to quash all further

proceedings in S.C.No.540/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court,

Palakkad arising out of Crime No.586/2013 of Shornur Police

Station, and to quash all further proceedings in C.C.No. 98/2013 of

Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad, arising out of Crime No. 586/2013

of Shornur Police Station and all further proceedings arising

therefrom.

     2.    The three petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.      5813/2013 are

accused Nos.1, 3 and 4 in Crime No. 586/2013 of Shornur Police

Station. The sole petitioner in Crime No. 5815/2013 (who was a

minor at the time of the alleged occurrence of the offence) is the 2nd

accused in Crime No.586/2006 of Shornur Police Station. The above

crime was registered for offences alleged under Sec. 341 read with

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC               - : 2 :-

Sec.34 of the IPC, Sec. 119(a) of Kerala Pollice Act and Sec.12 of the

Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The brief of

the prosecution case is that on 30.5.2013, at about 4 p.m. the

accused persons had wrongfully restrained the defacto complainant

and her friend (3rd respondent and the daughter of the 4th

respondent) while they were returning from the school and abused

them by sexual gestures and thus degraded their dignity and hence

committed the aforementioned offences. On receiving complaint,

Crime No.586/2013 was registered by the Shornur Police against

the aforementioned four accused persons. The police after

investigation filed the final report/charge sheet before the

competent court and now the matter is pending as S.C.No.

540/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court, Palakkad, in respect of

A1, A3 and A4 (the three petitioners in Crl.M.C.No. 5813/2014).

Since A-2 (the petitioner in Crl.M.C.No. 5815/2014) was a minor at

the time of the occurrence of the alleged offences, the case against

him was filed before the Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad, wherein

the same is pending as C.C.No.98/2013. Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No.

5813/2014 is the copy of the final report/charge sheet filed before

the Sessions Court, Palakkad, which has led to the institution of

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC                 - : 3 :-

S.C.No.540/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court, Palakkad.

Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No.5815/2014 is the copy of the final

report/charge sheet filed before the Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad,

which has led to the pendency of C.C.No.98/2013 on the file of the

Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad.

      3.     It is stated that the defacto complainant and the accused

persons are residing in the same locality and the complaint, which

led to the alleged incidents, occurred due to some family disputes

between the parties. Thereafter due to the intervention of mediators

and respectable members of the locality           including the Mahal

Committee members, the family members of the petitioner and the

respondents agreed to settle the entire disputes between the parties

and the parties are now living peacefully and cordially, it is averred.

Respondents 2 to 4 do not want to proceed with the matter and they

have no objection in quashing final report/charge sheet in respect

of S.C.No.540/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court, Palakkad

(Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No.5813/2013). The respondents also do

not have any objection in quashing the final report/charge sheet in

respect of C.C.No. 98/2013 on the file of the Juvenile Justice Court,

Palakkad (Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No. 5815/2014). Respondents 2 to

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC              - : 4 :-

4 have filed separate affidavits dated 8.10.2014, produced as

Annexures-2, 3 and 4 respectively in Crl.M.C.No.5813/2014 and

5815/2014. In those affidavits produced in these Criminal

Miscellaneous Cases the above said contesting respondents have

clearly stated that the complaint, which led to the institution of

S.C.No.540/2013 of the Sessions Court and C.C.No. 98/2013 on

the file of the Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad had arisen due to

misunderstanding and such disputes between the parties that the

entire disputes between them have been resolved and that the said

contesting respondents do not intend to proceed with the impugned

criminal proceedings and that they have no objection in quashing

the final report/charge sheet in respect of S.C.No. 540/2013 on the

file of Sessions Court, Palakkad and C.C.No. 98/2013 on the file of

the Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad, as against the four accused

persons concerned who are the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.

5813/2014 and Crl.M.C.No.5815/2014. It is stated that the

contesting respondents are now leading a peaceful and cordial life

and that any further continuation of the criminal proceedings is

unwarranted and that they have no objection in quashing of the

aforementioned final report/charge sheet in respect of these cases

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC               - : 5 :-

as against the above said accused persons who are the petitioners

in these cases. It is in the back ground these facts and

circumstances that the petitioners have filed these Criminal

Miscellaneous Cases with the above said prayers.

      4.     These Criminal Miscellaneous Cases have been admitted.

Sri.C.Vinod Kumar has taken notice for respondents 2 to 4 in

Crl.M.C.No.5813/2014 and respondents 2 to 4 in Crl.M.C.No.

5815/2014. The learned Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the

1st respondent-State of Kerala in Crl.M.C.No.5813/2014 as well as

for the 1st respondent-State of Kerala in Crl.M.C.No. 5815/2014.

      5.     Heard Sri. K.K.Dheerendrakrishnan., the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners in these cases, Sri.C.Vinod Kumar, the

learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 to 4 in these matters

and the learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent-

State in these cases.

      6.     The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of             the aforementioned criminal

proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between the

parties,   which    has   resulted    the  subject  matter  of   the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC                - : 6 :-

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have arrived

at an amicable settlement and any further continuation of the

criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of time and

money and would unnecessarily strain the judicial, administrative

and financial resources of the State.

      7.     The learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 to 4 in

these cases has submitted on the basis of the specific instructions

furnished by respondents 2 to 4 in these cases that respondents 2

to 4 have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners and

that they have no objection in the quashment of the impugned

criminal proceedings and that the complainant/victim/injured do

not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners as they

have no grievance against them and that they will not raise any

dispute/compliant in future if the prayer for quashing the impugned

final report is allowed.

      8.     The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who also

has not raised any serious objections and submitted that this Court

may consider the prayer in this case in the light of the law well

settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC                    - : 7 :-

      9.      After having carefully considered the submissions of the

parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as the

documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be seen that

the offences alleged are more or less personal in nature. The crucial

aspect of the matter is that though such offences are involved, the

real disputants to the controversy which has led to the impugned

criminal proceedings, have actually arrived at an amicable

settlement of the matter. From the submissions made by the

learned counsel for respondents 2 to 4, it is clear to the court that

the injured/victim/defacto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived

at by them.

      10.     In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012) 10 SCC 303 =

2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme Court has held as

follows in para 61 thereof [See SCC (Cri)]:

             "61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can
      be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
      jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
      criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.
      limitationInherent has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
                         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
                 but it

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC                        - : 8 :-

        engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
        prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
        quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
        exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
        would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
        category can be prescribed.."

It is further held as follows:-

        "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
        dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
        of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
        financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
        offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family
        disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
        and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
        cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
        because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
        criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
        and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
        criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
        with the victim........"

In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav & others v. The

State of Jharkhand & another reported in 2014 (8) SCALE 634 = III

(2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR 426 (SC), the Apex Court has

held as follows:

                 "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
        entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public peace
        or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such proceedings on
        account of compromise would bring about peace and would secure
        ends of justice, it should not hesitate to quash them".

The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case involving

offences under Secs. 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307 read with Sec. 34

Indian Penal Code.

        11.       Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, it

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC               - : 9 :-

is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings have arisen

consequent to the personal disputes between the disputants and

the disputes have been settled amicably between the parties.

Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold that in the light of the

facts and circumstances involved in the present case and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,

the principles laid down in the aforementioned decisions of the

Apex Court will be squarely applicable in the present case.

Moreover, since the real disputants to the controversy have

amicably settled the disputes, which led to these impugned criminal

proceedings, it is also the duty of the court to promote such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer wastage of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount to

abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger sense.

Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra, this Court

Crl.M.C.5813/14& CC               - : 10 :-

is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed by granting the

prayers sought for.

      12.    In the result, these Criminal Miscellaneous Cases are

allowed. The impugned final report/charge sheet filed in Crime No.

586/2013 of Shornur Police Station, Palakkad, which has led to the

institution of S.C.No.540/2013 on the file of the Sessions Court

Palakkad (Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No.5813/2014) and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The impugned final

report/charge sheet filed in Crime No. 586/2013 of Shornur Police

Station, Palakkad, which has led to the institution of C.C.No.

98/2013 on the file of the Juvenile Justice Court, Palakkad

(Annexure-1 in Crl.M.C.No. 5815/2014) and all further proceedings

arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners shall produce

certified copies of this order before the court below concerned as

well as before the Station House Officer, Shornur Police Station.

           Dated this the 3rd day of January, 2014



                          O R D E R

          The revision petitioner is the respondent in

M.C.No.139/2008 on the files of the Family Court,

Thrissur. He is the husband of the respondent herein.

Their marriage was solemnized on 26.8.2007 and they

lived together as husband and wife upto 25.11.2007.

According to the respondent, though she is the legally

wedded wife of the revision petitioner, he has been

neglecting  her and refusing to pay maintenance

allowance to her from 25.11.2007 onwards. She has no

job or income and she is unable to maintain herself. Now,

she is depending upon her parents for her livelihood.

But, the revision petitioner is working abroad and is

getting `25,000/- per month as income. He is also having

properties having an extent of 37 cents in Kadavallur

Panchayath, 77 cents in Padakkara Desom and 97 cents

of Nilam in Kadavallur Panchayath.            He is getting an

R.P(FC).141/12                  :2:



income of `20,000/- from his landed properties.        In

addition to that, he is doing real estate business and is

getting `10,000/- per month as income from his business.

Thus, his total monthly income would come to `50,000/-

per month.      The respondent requires an amount of

`5,000/- per month for her maintenance allowance.

     2.     The learned Family Court Judge directed the

revision petitioner to pay maintenance allowance at the

rate of `3,500/- per month. This order is under challenge

in this Revision Petition.

     3.     The  revision  petitioner  filed  a  counter

statement admitting the marriage, but denying the

allegations regarding the misappropriation of gold

ornaments and an amount of `1 lakh.        He denied the

allegation that he treated her with cruelty on demand of

more dowry from her parents. It is alleged that she is

suffering from serious mental illness.     He denied the

claim of the respondent that he is getting a monthly

income of `50,000/- per month. According to him, he is a

coolie worker.

R.P(FC).141/12                    :3:



     4.     Heard the learned counsel for the revision

petitioner and the respondent. They advanced arguments

in support of their respective contentions raised in the

M.C. In view of the rival contentions, the short question

that arises for consideration is, whether there is any

illegality or impropriety in the impugned order under

challenge? Put it differently, the question is, whether the

court below can be justified in directing the revision

petitioner to pay maintenance allowance at the rate of

`3,500/- per month?

     5.     The marriage is seen admitted and it is also

admitted that they have lived together upto 25.11.2007

only; i.e. they lived together for a period of 3 months only.

The revision petitioner has no case that he has been

paying maintenance allowance to the respondent after

25.11.2007.       But, he claimed that while she was

undergoing treatment in the hospital for removal of

fibroid from the uterus, he met the entire expenses and

stood as a bystander in the hospital. But, there is no

evidence to show that he has paid any amount to her as

R.P(FC).141/12                    :4:



maintenance allowance. Though he contended that the

respondent is having suicide tendency because of her

mental aberration, no evidence has been adduced to

substantiate the said contention.     It has come out in

evidence that he is in joint possession of 2 acres and 18

cents of property along with his brother after the death of

his father. Though the respondent contended that he is a

real estate broker and he is getting `20,000/- per month

from that business, no evidence has been adduced to

substantiate the said contention.        The court below

observed that it has come out in evidence from the

records that the respondent was in Gulf and right now he

is in native place and in joint possession of his family

property along with his brother. The revision petitioner

has no case that he is physically disabled, unhealthy or

incapacitated to do work so as to earn his livelihood for

his wife. So long as the marital tie is subsisting, the

revision petitioner is liable to pay maintenance allowance

to his wife. An able-bodied man is presumed to be having

sufficient earning capacity to maintain his family. The

R.P(FC).141/12                    :5:



revision petitioner is miserably failed to show that the

respondent is having means for her livelihood and she is

able enough to maintain herself. On the above premise,

there is no illegality or impropriety in the finding that the

revision petitioner is liable to pay maintenance allowance

to the respondent.

     6.     Coming   to the quantum of maintenance

allowance, admittedly he is in joint possession of 2 acres

and 18 cents of property and he had been working abroad

for a period of 3 years. Having regard to the standard of

life and living cost of the respondent and also the

admitted evidence regarding the income of the revision

petitioner, I find that there is no illegality or impropriety

in the determination of the quantum of maintenance

allowance and the same does not call for any interference

under the revisional jurisdiction.

     The Revision Petition is dismissed accordingly.

                         ................................
                     Crl.M.C.No. 2355 of 2015
                     ........................................
               Dated this the 18th day of June, 2015

                                   ORDER

  Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 in C.C.No.688 of 2014 on

  the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pattambi. Now

  they are facing a trial for the offences punishable under

  Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. During the course of

  trial, they have settled the entire disputes between them and

  arrived at a compromise.              Now the 2nd respondent is not

  interested to prosecute the petitioner Nos.1 to 5 and he has

  no subsisting grievance at all. The 2nd respondent has filed

  an Annexure-3 affidavit stating that he has no objection to

  quashing the crime pending against the petitioner.



2.The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent

  submits that the averments in Annexure-3 affidavit are true

  and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and

  according to his instructions also                    at present the 2nd

  respondent had no subsisting grievance and he is not

  interested to prosecute the petitioners.



2.I have meticulously considered the decision laid down in Gian

  Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)]. In the

Crl.M.C.No. 2355 of 2015
                                      2


   above case, three Judge Bench of the Apex Court, on a

   reference, considered the question whether the High Court

   has power to quash criminal proceedings involving non-

   compoundable offences on the basis of the compromise

   reached between the offender and the victim and answered

   as given below:

            "57.    The position that emerges from the above

            discussion can be summarised thus: the power

            of the High Court in quashing a criminal

            proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its

            inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

            the   power   given    to  a   criminal   court   for

            compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

            no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

            in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

            power viz;(1) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)

            to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In

            what     cases power     to   quash   the   criminal

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have

            settled their dispute would depend on the facts

            and circumstances of each case and no category

            can be prescribed. However, before exercise of

            such power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.

            Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity

            or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,

            cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

Crl.M.C.No. 2355 of 2015
                                     3


            victim or victim's family and the offender have

            settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

            in nature and have serious impact on society.

            Similarly, any compromise between the victim

            and offender in relation to the offences under

            special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

            or the offences committed by public servants

            while working in that capacity etc; cannot

            provide for any basis for quashing criminal

            proceedings involving such offences.        But the

            criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

            footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly

            the offences arising from commercial, financial,

            mercantile,   civil, partnership     or  such   like

            transactions or the offences arising out of

            matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family

            disputes where the wrong is basically private or

            personal in nature and the parties have resolved

            their entire dispute. In this category of cases,

            High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

            its view, because of the compromise between the

            offender and victim, the possibility of conviction

            is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

            case would put accused to great oppression and

            prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

            to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

            full and complete settlement and compromise

            with the victim. In other words, the High Court

            must consider whether it would be unfair or

            contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

Crl.M.C.No. 2355 of 2015
                                     4


            the criminal proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse

            of process of law despite settlement and

            compromise between the victim and wrongdoer

            and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

            appropriate that criminal case is put to an end

            and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

            affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

            jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



        2. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is, whether the

non-compoundable offence involved in this case can be

compounded, in the exercise of the inherent power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I

find that the offences alleged against the petitioner will not

come under the category of non-compoundable offences, which

are specifically excluded from composition, in the exercise of

inherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C.              Going by the

affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is seen that the

dispute between the accused and the victim had been amicably

settled and, at present, the de facto complainant has no

subsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant does not

want to proceed with prosecution against the accused.             Full

and final settlement and compromise with the victim are

Crl.M.C.No. 2355 of 2015
                                   5


evidenced by Annexure-3. In view of the compromise between

the petitioner and the victim, I find that the possibility of

conviction is remote, bleak and continuation of the criminal

case would, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice and

also tantamount to abuse of the process of the court.          The

present criminal prosecution against the accused must be put

to an end to secure the interest of justice.

        3. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings against

the petitioner under Annexure-2            final report will stand

quashed.

        This petition is disposed of as above.

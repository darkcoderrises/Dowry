       ------------------------------------------------------
                Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013
       ------------------------------------------------------
      Dated this the 27th day of November, 2013

                            ORDER




    The revision petitioners are the 1st and 2nd accused in

C.C.No.206/08 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's   Court-II,    Pathanamthitta.            They    were

prosecuted, along with the 3rd accused, for the offences

punishable under Secs.120B, 452, 323, 324 and 427 read

with Sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code.               After trial, the

learned Magistrate found the revision petitioners guilty of

the said offences, except the offence under Sec.120B of the

IPC, and convicted thereunder. They were sentenced to

undergo simple imprisonment for six months each for the

offences under Secs.452, 323, 324 and 427 read with Sec.34

 Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 2 :-

of the IPC.    They were also sentenced to pay a fine of

`5,000/- each. In default, simple imprisonment for the

offence under Sec.452 read with Sec.34 of the IPC.       If the

fine amount is realised, a sum of `5,000/- shall be paid to

P.W.1 under Sec.357(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C.        Set off is also

allowed to A1 and A2.

     2. Feeling aggrieved, they have preferred Crl. Appeal

Nos.69 and 70 of 2013 before the learned Additional District

& Sessions Judge, (Ad hoc)-II), Pathanamthitta.    The learned

Sessions Judge, after appreciating the evidence on record,

confirmed the conviction and sentence, as such, without any

interference.   This revision petition is filed challenging the

concurrent findings of conviction and sentence.

     3. Though this revision petition has been filed on

various grounds challenging the concurrent findings of

conviction and sentence, now the revision petitioners, along

with the de facto complainant, filed Crl.M.A.No.8476/13

under Sec.320(6) of the Cr.P.C. for compounding the

 Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 3 :-

offences.

     4. In the affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is

specifically stated that the dispute between the revision

petitioners and the de facto complainant is settled and he

had no objection in terminating the prosecution and setting

aside the conviction entered and the sentence imposed on

the revision petitioners. It is also stated in the petition filed

by both parties that they intend to compound the above

offences.

     5. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners

submits that among the offences, the offence under Sec.452

of the IPC is not a compoundable offence.          The learned

counsel for the revision petitioners cited a decision reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab          [(2012 (4) KLT 108

(Supreme Court)] and drew my attention to paragraph-57 of

the said judgment and submits that non-compoundable

offences    can also be compounded in exercise of the

jurisdiction under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C.      Paragraph-57 of

 Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 4 :-

the said judgment is extracted below:

               "57. The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:

          the power of the High Court in quashing a

          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in

          exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

          and different from the power given to a

          criminal court for compounding the offences

          under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is

          of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation

          but it has to be exercised in accord with the

          guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

          abuse of the process of any Court. In what

          cases    power    to    quash    the    criminal

          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

          exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on

          the facts and circumstances of each case

          and no category can be prescribed. However,

          before exercise of such power, the High

          Court must have due regard to the nature

          and gravity of the crime. Heinous and

          serious offences of mental depravity or

Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 5 :-

         offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,

         cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

         victim or victim's family and the offender

         have settled the dispute. Such offences are

         not private in nature and have serious

         impact on society. Similarly, any compromise

         between the victim and offender in relation

         to the offences under special statutes like

         Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences

         committed by public servants while working

         in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any

         basis for quashing criminal proceedings

         involving such offences. But the criminal

         cases   having    overwhelmingly     and   pre-

         dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

         footing   for  the   purposes    of  quashing,

         particularly  the    offences   arising   from

         commercial,    financial,   mercantile,    civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the

         offences arising out of matrimony relating to

         dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the

         wrong is basically private or personal in

         nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 6 :-

         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

         its  view,    because    of   the  compromise

         between     the    offender  and   victim,   the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak

         and continuation of criminal case would put

         accused to great oppression and prejudice

         and extreme injustice would be caused to

         him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite full and complete settlement and

         compromise with the victim. In other words,

         the High Court must consider whether it

         would be unfair or contrary to the interest of

         justice   to    continue   with   the   criminal

         proceeding or continuation of the criminal

         proceeding would tantamount to abuse of

         process of law despite settlement and

         compromise        between    the   victim   and

         wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

         of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case

         is put to an end and if the answer to the

         above question(s) is in affirmative, the High

         Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

         quash the criminal proceeding".

 Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 7 :-

Going by the above judgment, it is seen that the Apex Court

considered the question whether a non-compoundable

offence can be compounded in exercise of the jurisdiction

under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. and held that no straight jacket

formula can be formulated for the same; but a non-

compoundable offence can also be compounded considering

the facts and circumstances of each case.       The Apex Court

categorised certain non-compoundable offences as offences

for which the jurisdiction under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. can

never be invoked. Sec.452 of the IPC is not included in the

said category of offences.

     6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this

case, in view of the compounding petition filed by the

revision petitioners, along with the affidavit of the de facto

complainant, I am inclined to compound the offence under

Sec.452 of the IPC also in exercise of the jurisdiction under

Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. for the interest of justice.

     7. In the result, the sentence imposed on the revision

Crl.R.P. No. 1808 of 2013 -: 8 :-

petitioners for all the offences including the offence under

Sec.452 of the I.P.C. will stand compounded and the revision

petitioners are acquitted of under Sec.320(8) of the Cr.P.C.

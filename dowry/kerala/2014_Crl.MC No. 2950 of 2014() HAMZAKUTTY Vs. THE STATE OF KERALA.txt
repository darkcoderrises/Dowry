              ===========================
                Crl.M.C Nos.2950 & 3157 of 2014
              ============================
               Dated this the 22nd day of July, 2014

                              ORDER


      Crl.M.C No.2950/2014 is directed against Crime No.

636/2011 of Ponnani Police Station involving offences punishable

under Sections 324 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code which was

registered on the basis of the information furnished by the 2nd

respondent in the above Crl.M.C, who is the de facto complainant

therein.    Crl.M.C No.3157/2014 is directed against Crime

No.617/2011 of the very same Police Station for the offence

punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, instituted

at the instance of the de facto complainant, one Nadira, who is the

2nd respondent in Crl.M.C No.3157/2014. The petitioner in the

above Crl.M.C is the sole accused in Crime No.617/2011. It is

Crl.MC No.2950/2014&3157/2014          2




also relevant to note that the victim in Crime No.617/2011 of

Ponnani Police Station is the daughter of the first accused in Crime

No.636/2011. As the entire dispute involved in the above two

cases are settled, the petitioners who are accused in the above

crimes approached this Court by filing the above two different

Crl.M.Cs under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.     Heard Adv. Sri. Babu.S.Nair, learned counsel for

petitioner and Adv.Sri.Ranjith.R, learned counsel appearing for the

2nd respondent in Crl.M.C No.2950/2014, Adv.Sri.K.B.Arunkumar,

learned counsel for petitioner and Adv.Sri.Rakesh. K, lcearned

counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent, in Crl.M.C No.3157/2014

and also the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3. It appears that on the basis of the crimes registered the

Police had undertaken investigation and finally they prepared

Crl.MC No.2950/2014&3157/2014            3




charge on the basis of which proceedings now instituted and thus,

S.C No.23/2013 was instituted in the Court of Additional Sessions

Judge(Fast      Track     Court No.-III), Manjeri    against  Crime

No.636/2011 and similarly, S.C No.583/2013 is instituted, which

pending trial in the court of Additional Sessions Judge - I, Manjeri

connected with Crime No. 617/2011.

      4. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it appears that the first crime was registered with Crime

No. 617/2011 connected with the alleged incident of rape of the

victim therein who is the daughter of the first accused in Crime No.

636/2011. As the entire dispute had been settled between the

contesting parties, I am of the view that even if the trial is

proceeded there is no scope for any fruitful prosecution rather the

same will be resulted in wastage of judicial time. As the victim in

Crl.MC No.2950/2014&3157/2014                  4




the rape case is already married and she is leading a peaceful

married life it is not advisable to proceed the crime in the above

two cases. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
         Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct
         and different from the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends
         of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
         Court.    In what cases power to quash the criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where
         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
         category can be prescribed..

Crl.MC No.2950/2014&3157/2014                     5




It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
           pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
           the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
           from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or
           such like transactions or the offences arising out of
           matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes
           where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature
           and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
           proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of
           conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
           case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
           quashing the criminal case despite        full and complete
           settlement and compromise with the victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the above decision, all the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in the above two cases

can be quashed, particularly in view of Annexure C affidavit of 2nd

respondent in Crl.M.C No.2950/2014 and Annexure 2 affidavit of

the victim in Crl.M.C No.3157/2014.

Crl.MC No.2950/2014&3157/2014          6




      In the result, Crl.M.C No. 2950/2014 is allowed quashing all

further proceedings in S.C No.23/2013 on the file of Additional

Sessions Court (Fast Track Court No.III), Manjeri arising out of

Crime No. 636/2011 of the Ponnani Police Station and Crl.M.C

No.3157/2014 is also allowed quashing Annexure - I F.I.R and

final report in the above crime and all further proceedings pending

against the petitioner in S.C No.583/2013 on the file of the Court

of Additional Sessions Judge - I, Manjeri.

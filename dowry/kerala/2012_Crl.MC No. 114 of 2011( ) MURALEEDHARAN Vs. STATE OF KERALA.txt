                   Crl.M.C.NO. 114 OF 2011
                 ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 3rd day of April, 2012


                              O R D E R


      This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure is filed by the accused in C.C.No.454/2001 on the file

of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Alathur. They are

being prosecuted by the Station House Officer, Managalamdam

Police Station accusing offence under Section 498 A read with 34

of the Indian Penal Code. Seeking order to quash Annexure-II

Final Report, they approached this court twice, by filing Crl.M.C

825/2009 and 4595/2010. But they were not successful. The

trial was proceeded with.

      2. After the framing of charge, the defacto complainant

filed a revision before the Sessions Judge, Palakkad with a plea

that instead of framing charge for offence under Section 498 A

IPC, charge for offence under Sections 304 B and 306 of the

Indian Penal Code should have been framed. But was not

Crl.M.C.NO. 114 OF 2011            2




successful.

      3. During the course of trial, after examining PWs 1 to 4,

the Assistant Public Prosecutor filed a petition seeking an order to

alter the charge to Sections 304 B and 306 of the Indian Penal

Code.   By Annexure VIII order, that petition was dismissed.

Subsequently, after examining PWs 5 and 6, the trial court, suo

motu, by Annexure XI order, which is impugned in this petition,

arrived at a finding that by the evidence of PWs 2, 5 and 6,

offences under Sections 304 B and 306 of the Indian Penal Code

are revealed out and proceeded for committing the case to the

Court of Sessions. It is assailing that order, this petition is filed.

      4.  I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners as well as the defacto complainant.           I was taken

through the evidence of PWs 2, 5 and 6 and earlier orders of this

Court mentioned earlier by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

      5. The prosecution case is that the 1st petitioner herein

Crl.M.C.NO. 114 OF 2011          3




married the daughter of the defacto complainant on 14/11/1996,

in accordance with customary rites and they were living together

as husband and wife. While so, the 1st petitioner demanded a sum

of Rs.1,00,000/- and it was paid by the defacto complainant. Even

after such payment, the petitioners were demanding more dowry

and ornaments and the victim was subjected to cruelty and

harassment. As a result of such domestic violence, the daughter of

the defacto complainant committed suicide on 7/11/1999. The

evidence of PW2 regarding demand for dowry is very vague. So

also the evidence of PW5 is vague.       But, going through the

evidence of PW6, I find that there were further demands for

dowry and that the victim was being tortured in demand of

dowry. The evidence of PW6 would show that in the morning on

the date of suicide, the deceased rang to the defacto complainant

and informed that it was very difficult for her to live at the

matrimonial home and that she was being tortured on demand of

Crl.M.C.NO. 114 OF 2011          4




money. Though, the defacto complainant attempted to talk to the

victim, the 1st petitioner disconnected the phone and again

threatened the deceased.    According to PW6, that threat was

informed to him, when he later telephoned to the victim. Going

by the evidence of PW6, I find that the victim was subjected

harassment in connection with demand for dowry soon before the

victim committing suicide. Therefore, the impugned order of the

trial court is in tune with the evidence on record. I find little

reason to interfere with the order impugned. This petition is

devoid of merits. Accordingly it is dismissed.

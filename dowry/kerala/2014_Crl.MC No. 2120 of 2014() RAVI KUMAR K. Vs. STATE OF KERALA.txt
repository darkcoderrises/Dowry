                  --------------------------------------------------------------
                         Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 11th day of April, 2014


                                      O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the sole accused in C.C.No.1160/2011 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Parappanangadi, to quash the proceedings in view of the

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called the `Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.1160/2011 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Parappanangadi,

which was originated on the basis of the statement given by

the 2nd respondent/ defacto-complainant, as Annexure-AI

first  information           report         as       Crime          No.419/2011    of

Thiroorangadi Police Station under Section 427 of the

Indian Penal Code and Section 118(a) of Kerala Police Act

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                                   2

and after investigation, Annexure-AII final report was filed

and it was taken on file as C.C.1160/11 and it is pending

before     the    Judicial   First  Class    Magistrate    Court-I,

Parappanangadi. Now the matter has been settled between

the parties. Though Section 118(a) of Police Act has been

incorporated, in fact, according to the petitioner, the

medical certificate will go to show that though he consumed

alcohol, he was on under the influence of alcohol so as to

attract the offence under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police

Act. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility of

conviction.     Since    some     of   the   offences    are non-

compoundable in nature, they could not file an application

before the court below, so the petitioner has no other

remedy, except to approach this court, seeking the

following relief:

             "For these and other ground that may be allowed
      to be advance at the time of hearing it is most
      respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be
      pleased to quash all further proceedings in Annexure A2
      final   report   pending  before  Judicial  First Class
      Magistrate      Court    No.1,    Parappanangady     in
      C.C.No.1160/11 arising of of crime No.63/2011 of

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                                 3

      Thiroorangadi Police Station and allow this petition
      accordingly."

            3.    2nd respondent appeared through counsel

and submitted that, the matter has been settled between

the parties and the 2nd respondent does not want to

prosecute the petitioner and also submitted that, he had

filed Annexure-AIII affidavit stating these facts. The counsel

for the petitioner submitted that, though Section 118(a) of

Kerala Police Act is incorporated, no offence under that

Section has been attracted and in view of the settlement,

there is no possibility of conviction and so the petitioner

prays for allowing the application.

            4.    Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that,

there is no other case against the petitioner, but opposed

the application on the ground that Section 118(a) of Police

Act has been incorporated.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent as defacto-

complainant, Annexure-AI first information report was

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                               4

registered as Crime No.419/2011 of Thiroorangadi Police

Station, against the petitioner, alleging offences under

Section 427 and 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act. It is also

an admitted fact that, after investigation, Annexure-AII final

report was filed, it was taken on file as C.C.1160/2011 and

it is pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Parappanangadi. In the meantime, the matter has

been settled between the parties. The 2nd respondent has

filed Annexure-AIII affidavit stating that, in view of the

settlement arrived at between the parties due to the

intervention of well-wishers of both the parties, he does not

want to prosecute the case.

            6.    The counsel for the petitioner had produced

the copy of the medical certificate, which will go to show

that, though smell of the alcohol was felt at the time of

examination, he was not under the influence of alcohol. So

under such circumstances, the possibility of conviction

under Section 118(a) of Kerala Police Act will be remote.

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                                       5

Further, in view of the settlement, neither the defacto-

complainant nor his witnesses will support the case of the

prosecution as well. Further the petitioner is a doctor and

considering the fact that, the matter has been settled and

the possibility of conviction is remote. No purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case, as it will amount to

wastage of judicial time.

            7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

      "The position that emerges from the above discussion can be
      summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
      criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
      inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
      S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
      no statutory limitation but has to be exercised in accord with
      the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
      ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
      Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
      or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and
      victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
      and circumstances of each case an no category can be
      prescribed.   However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of
      the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity
      or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
      offender have settled the dispute.     Such offences are not
      private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                                       6

      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide
      for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for
      the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising
      from commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes
      where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
      the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
      of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
      and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it would
      be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with
      the criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal
      proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law
      despite settlement and compromise between the victim and
      wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is
      appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the
      answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
      Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."



            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision cited (supra) and also considering the fact that the

matter has been settled and there is no possibility of

conviction in view of the settlement and proceeding with the

case will be only a wastage of judicial time, this court feels

that it is a fit case where the power under Section 482 has

Crl. M.C. No.2120 of 2014
                                  7

to be invoked to quash the proceedings. So the petition is

allowed and further proceedings in C.C.No.1160/2011

(Crime No.419/2011 of           Thiroorangadi Police Station)

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Parappanangadi, as against the petitioner is quashed. Office

is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court, for necessary further action.

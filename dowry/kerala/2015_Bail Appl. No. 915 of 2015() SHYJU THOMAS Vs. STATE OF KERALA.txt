               ============================
                       B.A. No.915 of 2015
              =============================
             Dated this the 25th day of February, 2015

                            O R D E R


      Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

      2. According to the petitioners, they are apprehending

arrest in connection with Crime No.247 of 2015 of the

Kunnicode Police Station (Crime No.183 of 2015 of the

Punalur Police Station), registered for the offence punishable

under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code.

      3. The learned Public Prosecutor has pointed out that

petitioners 2 and 3 have been removed from the array of the

accused and presently they are not accused in the crime.

Therefore, there cannot be any apprehension for petitioners 2

and 3 that they would be arrested in connection with the said

crime.

      4. The allegation against the 1st petitioner is that he has

B.A. No.915 of 2015             2

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is his

wife, and treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry

and gold ornaments, after misappropriating her entire gold

ornaments and money.

      5. The crime has been registered on the basis of a

private complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-III, Punalur, which was

referred to the Police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. Initially

the crime was registered as Crime No.183 of 2015 of the

Punalur Police Station and the same was subsequently

transferred to the Kunnicode Police Station, where, it was re-

registered as Crime No.257 of 2015.

      6.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      7. This is clearly a matrimonial offence. By considering

the chance of re-union and a settlement in the matter, I am of

the view that this is a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be

granted to the 1st petitioner.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed in part and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

B.A. No.915 of 2015              3

conducting the arrest of the 1st petitioner, is directed to

enlarge the 1st petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on

his executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each

to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject

to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The 1st petitioner shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00 a.m. on all Wednesdays and Saturdays

     commencing from 04.03.2015 for a period of three

     months.

            (ii) The 1st petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The 1st petitioner shall make himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The 1st petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

B.A. No.915 of 2015           4

     This bail application, as far as petitioners 2 and 3 are

concerned, is dismissed.

             =======================
              Dated this the 7th day of April, 2015

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

and Annexure-2 Final Report in Crime No.182 of 2006 of the

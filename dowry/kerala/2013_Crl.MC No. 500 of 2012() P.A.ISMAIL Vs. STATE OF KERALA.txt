             -------------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C.No.500 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 31st day of October, 2013

                              ORDER

       This petition is filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for

quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioners 1 to 3

who are accused 2, 3 and 4 in C.C.No.45/2010 of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Kanjirappally.

       2.   The case of the petitioners 1 and 2 is that their son

'Shiyas' married the 4th respondent as per Muslim customary

rites, on 11.10.2009. After the marriage, they resided in the

matrimonial house for 14 days only and thereafter, they

separated.     Shiyas is now working abroad.          While the 4th

respondent was residing in the matrimonial house, the petitioners

ill- treated her physically and mentally demanding more amount

and gold as dowry. Therefore, she was forced to file a complaint

before the Kanjirappally Police Station and they registered a

crime under Section 498A of IPC. After completing investigation,

a final report was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Crl.M.C.No.500/12                2

Court-I, Kanjirappally on 31.12.2009.         The petitioners'

allegation is that the 4th respondent was resided in the

matrimonial house till 24/10/2009 and thereafter, she left the

house along with her ornaments. Subsequently, she was taken

to the petitioners' house on 21.11.2009.     Her allegation in

Ext.A2 was that her husband 'Shiyas' threatened her and

demanded more amount and gold as dowry. She also alleged

that the petitioners also ill-treated her both physically and

mentally demanding more amount as dowry.               Hence,

Kanjirappally    Police registered  the  above    crime   and

investigated and submitted final report.

      3.    The learned counsel for the petitioners contended

that there was no allegation of cruelty by the petitioners

against the 4th respondent. There was no demand of dowry or

harassment from their side. They were arrayed as party only

to harass them which is only an abuse of process of law. No

statement was recorded from the witness side also and Section

498A IPC is not attracted against the petitioners.    As the

marital relationship subsisted only for few days and the 4th

respondent remarried even after that on 4.10.2009,         the

petitioners agreed to pay the entire amount before the Jama

Crl.M.C.No.500/12                 3

ath by virtue of Annexure-A3 agreement. If the petitioners are

forced to appear before the Court on false allegations, it is a

pure abuse of process of law, since no allegation is made

against these petitioners in the police case. Hence, they pray

to quash the entire criminal proceedings against them.

      4.    There was no representation for the 4th respondent.

The learned Public Prosecutor represented for respondents 1 to

3     and contended that the evidence collected by the

investigating agency shows a prima facie case against the

petitioners. Hence, he prayed to not to interfere in the final

report and for ends of justice, a fair trial is necessary.

      5.    Based upon the arguments, I have perused the final

report submitted by the police and the allegations in Annexure-

A2. According to Section 482 Cr.P.C., the inherent powers of

the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to

give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of

process of any Court or otherwise for securing the ends of

justice.   The statement given by the 4th respondent in the

Kanjirappally Police Station shows that her marriage was on

11.10.2009 at Kanjani Indu Auditorium as per Muslim

customary rites.     Thereafter, she was residing with her

Crl.M.C.No.500/12                4

husband. At the time of marriage, she was given Rs.2 = lakh

as patrimony and 27 = sovereigns of gold. While she was

residing in the matrimonial house, petitioners 2 and 3 ill-

treated her by demanding more amount. Even though she

stated so, on which date she was ill-treated, how much

amount and gold demanded, are not specifically mentioned in

her statement. In the statement of the witness also, such a

demand was not found in evidence. In order to attract Section

498A, prosecution has to prima facie made out a case that the

4th respondent was subjected to cruelty by the husband and his

relatives, by their wilful conduct which is of such a nature as

is likely to drive her to cause grave injury or danger to life,

limb or health or to drive her to commit suicide.     Such an

allegation is not found in her statement. No allegation was

levelled against the father-in-law, the 1st petitioner in this

case.    Therefore, the allegations, the other averments and

evidence in this case show that the prima facie case is not

made out against petitioners 1 to 3. Therefore, such a charge

is an abuse of process against them.

      In such circumstances, invoking jurisdiction under

Section 482 of Cr.P.C., I quash the other proceedings against

Crl.M.C.No.500/12                5

petitioners 1 to 3 and this will not affect the final report filed

against 1st accused in Crime No.469/2009 of Kanjirappally

Police Station.

      The Crl.M.C. is allowed as above.




                                     P.D. RAJAN, JUDGE.

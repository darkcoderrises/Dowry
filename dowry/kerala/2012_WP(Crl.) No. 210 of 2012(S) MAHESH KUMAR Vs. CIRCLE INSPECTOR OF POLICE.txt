                                JUDGMENT

K.T.Sankaran, J.


       According to the petitioner, he married Vidhya, daughter of the

third respondent, in accordance with the religious rites on 4.3.2012.

It is stated by the petitioner that they lived together for a period of

three days.   On 14.3.2012, Vidhya went to her house under the

pretext that she had to take her hall ticket for the examinations.

Thereafter, she did not return to the house of the petitioner. It is

alleged that Vidhya is illegally detained by the third respondent.



       2. Today, the petitioner, Vidhya and her father are present.

Vidhya stated that she is residing in her house with her parents on

her own wish. She stated that she resided in the petitioner's house

for about one month and she was driven out of the house by the

petitioner and his relatives. She stated that there was demand for

dowry and, on account of inability to pay dowry, she was ill-treated

by the petitioner.

       3.  Vidhya stated that she does not want to go with the

petitioner. She is prepared to go with the third respondent, her

father. Vidhya stated that her certificates are with the petitioner.

Immediately, the petitioner handed over the certificates to Vidhya

and she stated that she has received the same.



       4.  We are satisfied that Vidhya is not under the illegal

detention of the third respondent. Therefore, it is not necessary to

issue any direction in the case.

       The Writ Petition (Criminal) is, accordingly, closed.

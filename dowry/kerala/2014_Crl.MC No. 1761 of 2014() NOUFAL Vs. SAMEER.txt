                     K. RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                  .................................................
                     Crl.M.C.No.1761 of 2014
                  ..................................................
             Dated this the 27th day of March, 2014.

                               O R D E R


     This   petition     is     filed       by      the       sole   accused   in

C.C.No.1501/2012 on the file of the Judicial First                          Class

Magistrate Court, Nadapuram                on the basis of           a settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.


     2. It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement   given by the          first     respondent Annexure-I            First

Information Report was registered as Crime No.417/2010 of

Nadapuram police station against the petitioner alleging                      the

offences under Sections 341 and 324 of the Indian Penal Code .

After investigation final report has been filed and it was taken

on file as C.C.No.1501/2012 and pending before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Nadapuram. The matter has been

settled between the parties and now the relationship has been

restored. The defacto complainant does not want to prosecute

the petitioner in view of the settlement. No purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case in view of the settlement.

Since the offence alleged is non compoundable in nature, they

Crl.M.C.No.1761 of 2014             2

cannot     file an       application before the court below for

compounding. So the petitioner has no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief:

        Therefore it is humbly prayed that the Crl.M.C may be

        allowed and Annexure-I F.I.R & police charge and all

        further proceedings in C.C.No.1501/2012 on the file of

        JFCM Court, Nadapuram in       Crime No.417/2010 of

        Nadapuram police may kindly be quashed against the

        petitioner.


      3. The first respondent appeared          through counsel and

submitted that matter has been settled between the parties and

he does not want to proceed with the case and he had filed an

affidavit to that effect.


      4. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the case.

      5. The Public Prosecutor, on instructions as directed by

this Court, submitted that there is no other case against the

petitioner except this case, but opposed the application.

      6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of a statement

given by the first respondent, Annexure-1 First Information

Crl.M.C.No.1761 of 2014               3

Report was registered against the petitioner and after final

report was filed, it is now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Nadapuram as              C.C.No.1501/2012.          The

matter has been settled between the parties.                       The first

respondent appeared through            counsel and submitted that the

matter has been settled and he does not want to prosecute the

petitioner and he had filed Annxure II affidavit to that effect. It

is seen from the records that the parties are neighbours and

due to intervention of mediators, the matter has been settled

and their relationship has been restored.

      7. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

          "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

          the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

          arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

          partnership or such like transactions or the offences

          arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

          family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

          entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

Crl.M.C.No.1761 of 2014                4

          may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

          of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

          continuation of criminal case would put accused to

          great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

          would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

          case   despite    full and   complete    settlement  and

          compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

          Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

          contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

          criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

          proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

          law despite settlement and compromise between the

          victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

          of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

          an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

          affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

          jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




      8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and in view of the settlement, possibility of

conviction is remote even if the trial of the case is allowed to

proceed with and the relationship has been restored between

Crl.M.C.No.1761 of 2014           5

parties on account of the settlement, this Court feels that this

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

to promote the settlement and         the harmony that has been

restored between the parties.


      9. So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.No.1501/12 (Crime No.417/2010 of Nadapuram police

station) pending before the       Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Nadapuram as against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to    communicate this order      to the

concerned court immediately.

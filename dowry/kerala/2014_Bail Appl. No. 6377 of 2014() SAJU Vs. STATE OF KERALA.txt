                        V.K. MOHANAN, J.

                ----------------------------
               Bail Application No. 6377 of 2014
              ------------------------------
             Dated this the Ist day of October, 2014
                              ORDER
      Petitioner who is the first accused in Crime No. 160/2011 of

Vellikulangara Police Station preferred this application for

anticipatory bail under Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

     2.     The prosecution allegation is that the marriage

between the petitioner and the de facto complainant was

solemnized on      28-09-2009 and thereafter, while she was

residing in the matrimonial home, the accused 4 in numbers in

furtherance of their common intention, demanding more dowry,

subjected her to matrimonial cruelty and thus according to the

prosecution, the accused have committed the offence punishable

under Sec. 498 A read with Sec. 34 of IPC.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

the learned Public Prosecutor.

Bail Application No. 6377 of 2014

                                   2

      4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioner was out of Station and, therefore, he could not appear

before the Court below and consequently, non-bailable warrant

is issued against him and in case the petitioner appears before

the court below, certainly he will be sent to jail. Therefore, he

seeks an order for pre-arrest bail.

      5.      On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor, on

instructions,     submitted    that the  police  after conducting

investigation laid the charge on 24-5-2011 before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Chalakkudy upon the court took

cognizance and instituted C.C. No. 780 of 2011 and commenced

trial and during which, CW1 was examined as P.W.1.

      6.      In the light of the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor,    it

appears to me that though the crime was registered as early as on

4-4-2011 the petitioner was not available and, therefore, the

investigation was proceeded and thereafter, the charge was laid ,

Bail Application No. 6377 of 2014

                                   3

showing the petitioner/Ist accused as absconding. Counsel for

the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has no case that the

petitioner was arrested or he has taken bail etc.

      7.    In view of the submission made by the learned Public

Prosecutor that the trial has already been commenced, it can be

seen that on the appearance of the petitioner, the Magistrate has

to record the evidence again.       Had the petitioner co-operated

with the police as well as the Court such a situation would not

have been arisen. As the petitioner failed to appear before the

Court the Magistrate was constrained to issue         non-bailable

warrant against the petitioner to procure his presence. In such a

situation, according me, this court will not be justified in either

granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner or directing the court

below to consider his application for withdrawing the warrant

or to release him on bail on the date of his surrender itself. The

power to re-call the warrant and granting bail are clearly the

discretionary powers to be exercised by the trial court.     If any

                                    4

order as requested above issued by this Court, that will amount

to usurpation of the powers of the trial court and stalling the

proceedings       initiated by the     trial Court. In the   above

circumstances, it is for the petitioner to approach the trial court

for re-calling the warrant and for regular bail setting forth the

reason which leads to the above situation. In case the petitioner

files such applications, the court below is directed to consider the

same on merit and          when the custody of the petitioner is not

required, particularly, when the charge has already been laid by

the police, I hope that the learned Magistrate will pass

appropriate orders. With the above observation this bail

application is dismissed.

          Dated this the 1st day of October, 2014.

                        Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 18th day of February, 2014


                                    O R D E R

          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner, who is the original 7th accused in Crime

No.191/2006 of Bekal Police Station, to quash the

proceedings under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.     It is alleged in the petition that the

petitioner is the original 7th accused in Crime No.191/2006

of Bekal Police Station and he was arrayed as accused

along with 8 other persons, alleging offences under Section

143, 147, 436 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal

Code.   After investigation final report was field and the

case against the other accused persons were committed to

Sessions Court, where it was taken on the file as

S.C.No.10/2008. Accused Nos.2 to 8 faced trial and the

case against them was ended in acquittal, as per Annexure-

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                                 2

B judgment of the Additional Sessions Court (ADHOC-II),

Kasaragod, dated 31.10.2009. Thereafter the 9th accused

settled the claim with the defacto-complainant and filed

Criminal M.C.No.141/2013 before this court and that was

allowed and the case against him was quashed as per

Annexure-D order. Now the only accused left out is the

present petitioner and since he was absconding, the case

against him was split up and transferred to the register of

long pending cases as L.P.No.11/2012 on the file of the

Additional      District   and  Sessions   Court    (ADHOC-II),

Ksaragod. The matter has been now settled between the

parties and the first respondent has no objection in

quashing the proceedings. Since the offences alleged are

non-compoundable in nature, he had no option but to

approach this court to quash the proceedings, invoking the

power under Section 482 of the 'Code'. So the petitioner

filed this application, seeking the following relief:

            "For these and other grounds to be urged at the
      time of hearing it is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble
      court may kindly quash the entire proceedings in

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                                  3

      L.P.No.11.2012 on the file of Additional District and
      Sessions Judge (Adhoc-II), Kasaragod (AnnexureA)."

            3.     The    first respondent    appeared    through

counsel and field an affidavit stating that, the matter has

been settled between the partis and he has no objection in

quashing the proceedings as against the petitioner also.

            4.     The      learned   Public     Prosecutor    on

instructions      submitted     that,  the   petitioner  has   no

involvement in any other criminal case and he has no

criminal back ground as well, but opposed the application.

            5.     Heard both sides.

            6.     It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was

arrayed as accused No.7 in Crime No.191/2006 of Bekal

Police Station, alleging offences under Section 143, 147,

436 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. It is

also an admitted fact that, after investigation Annexure-A

final report was filed and after committal, the case was

taken on the file by the Sessions Judge as S.C.No.10/2008,

as against all the accused persons. Since the present

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                               4

accused and the 9th accused absconded, during the

pendency of the case before the Additional Sessions Court

(ADHOC-II), Kasaragod, the case against other accused

persons, namely accused Nos. 2 to 6, 7 and 9 were taken on

the file as S.C.No.10/2008. Thereafter the case against the

original first accused was also committed and it was taken

on the file as S.C.No.25/2009 and later it was clubbed with

S.C.10/2008 and the first accused in the crime and sole

accused in S.C.No.25/2009 was arrayed as 8th accused in

S.C.No.10/2008. Since the present petitioner and 9th

accused were absconding, the case against them was split

up and the case against accused Nos.1 to 6 was proceeded

with and it was ended in acquittal, evidenced by Annexure-

B judgment and it is also seen from the judgment that, none

of the witnesses have supported the prosecution, so the

Sessions       Judge      had acquitted the   accused    in

S.C.No.10/2008 under Section 232 of the 'Code'. Later the

9th accused in the case filed Criminal M.C.No.141/2013

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                                     5

before this court, for quashing the proceedings against him

and that was also allowed as per Annexure-D judgment of

this court and the case against him was quashed on the

basis of the settlement arrived at between the present

defacto-complaint and the 9th accused in the case. Now the

petitioner     also     settled   the     case     with    the    defacto-

complainant and field this application for quashing the

proceedings as against him.

             7.    In the decision reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it has been

held that:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.    In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                                       6

      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in
      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s)
      is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


             8.    In this case, it is a private dispute between

the parties, which resulted in the case. Further most of the

accused persons were acquitted by the Sessions Court after

trial, none of the witnesses including the defacto-

complainant had supported the case of the prosecution, as

the matter was settled between them. The case against the

Crl. M. C. No.1180 of 2014
                               7

9th accused was quashed by this court as per Annexure-D

judgment. So considering the circumstances, I feel that no

purpose will be served by allowing the trial to continue as

regards the petitioner as well, as the case has been settled

between the defacto-complainant and the petitioner and the

defacto-complainant field an affidavit before this court

marked as Annexure-C, admitting the settlement and

expressing his willingness to quash the proceedings, as

against the petitioner. So considering the circumstances,

since the very foundation of the case has been lost on

account of the settlement and most of the accused persons

were      acquitted     by the court on   the  question   of

identification, I feel that no purpose will be served by

retaining this case on file and it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the 'Code' has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings as against the petitioner as well. So

the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

L.P.No.11/2012 (Crime No.191/2006 of Bekal Police Station)

on the file of the Additional Sessions Court (ADHOC-II),

Kasaragod, as against the petitioner is quashed. Office is

directed to communicate this order to the concerned court

for necessary further action, in this regard.

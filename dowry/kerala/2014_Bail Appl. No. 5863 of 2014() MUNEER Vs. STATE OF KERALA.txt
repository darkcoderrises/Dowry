                       V.K.MOHANAN, J
              ===========================
                      B.A No. 5863 of 2014
             ============================
             Dated this the 7th day of August, 2014

                            ORDER


     Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No. 616/2014 of

Chandera Police Station and apprehending arrest in the above

crime he preferred the above application for anticipatory bail under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner had

married the de facto complainant on 04.02.2001 and thereafter he

had harassed the de facto complainant both mentally and

physically demanding more dowry and, thus, the petitioner/

accused has committed the offences punishable under Sections

498A, 323, 324 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for petitioner as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor.

B.A No.5863/2014                 2



       4.    The learned counsel for petitioner submitted that the

above crime was registered on the basis of the complaint filed by

the de facto complainant in the Judicial First Class Magistrate - I,

Hosdurg and that too while several other litigations between the

petitioner and the de facto complainant were pending. According

to the learned counsel for petitioner, the de facto complainant did

not approach the police and therefore the present crime was

registered on the basis of the complaint filed in the court with a

view to harass the petitioner.

       5. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that only

minor injuries are sustained by the de facto complainant and there

were matrimonial disputes between the petitioner as well as the de

facto complainant.

       6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, according to me, the custody of the petitioner is not

required for the investigation in Crime No.616/2014 of Chandera

Police Station and therefore, the petitioner can be granted

B.A No.5863/2014                    3



anticipatory bail however, subject to strict conditions.

       In the result, this petition is allowed and, accordingly, there

will be a direction that in the event of the arrest of the petitioner in

Crime No.616/2014 of Chandera Police Station, he shall be

released on bail on his executing a bond for `35,000/- (Rupees

Thirty Five Thousand only) with two solvent sureties, each for like

amount, to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above

crime and on the following further conditions:

           i)   Petitioner   shall    report   before    the
                Investigating Officer in the above crime
                between 10 a.m and 11 a.m once in a
                fortnight on Saturday.

          ii)   Petitioner shall not tamper with the
                evidence   and    try  to  influence    any
                witnesses.

          iii) Petitioner shall not interfere with the
                investigation.

         -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 16th day of June, 2014



                                    O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioners in C.C.No.523/2013 on the file of Judicial First

Class   Magistrate           Court-II,           Hosdurg,             to     quash  the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called 'the

Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioners were arrayed as accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

C.C.No.523/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg, which was originated on the

basis of a case registered as Crime No.28/2013 of

Nileshwar Police Station, on the basis of the statement

given by the 2nd respondent/ defacto-complainant, alleging

offences under Section 341, 323, 324, 506(i) and 294(b)

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                   2

read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

            3.    After investigation, Annexure-A1 final report

was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.523/2013 and

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Hosdurg. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties. On account of the settlement, no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case as well. The defacto-

complainant does not want to prosecute the petitioner on

account of the settlement. Since some of the offences

alleged are non-compoundable in nature, they could not file

the application before the court below. So the petitioner

has no other remedy, except to approach this court, seeking

the following reliefs:

            "In view of the above grounds and the grounds that
      may be urged at the time of hearing this Hon'ble Court
      may be pleased to quash all further proceedings pending
      against the petitioners in C.C.No.523 of 2013 of the
      Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg".

            4.    The     2nd  respondent       appeared   through

counsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled

between the parties and he does not want to prosecute the

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                3

petitioners and the settlement itself was arrived at due to

the intervention of community leaders of the locality to

bring harmony among the members of the community and

he filed Annexure-A2 affidavit stating these facts.

            5.    The    counsel  for  the    petitioners  also

submitted that, they went there to pacify the altercation

between two groups of INL League Party and in that

altercation occurred and the incident happened and now

the matter has been settled. So he prayed for allowing the

application.

            6.    The    learned   Public     Prosecutor,   on

instructions as directed by this Court,        submitted that,

except this case, there is no other case pending against the

petitioners but opposed the application on the ground that

the incident happened due to some political rivalry.

            7.    It is an admitted fact that, petitioners were

arrayed as accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No. 28/2013 of

Nileshwar police station. It was registered on the basis of

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                               4

the statement given by the 2nd respondent and after

investigation Annexure-A1 final report was filed and it is

now pending as C.C.No.523/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg. It is also seen

from the gist of the allegations in Annexure-A1 that, when

there was some altercation going on between the workers

of Indian National League Party and on seeing this, they

went there to pacify them and in that process, some

incident happened and the crime has registered. Now due

to the intervention of community leaders and others and

well-wishers of both parties, the matter has been settled

between the parties and harmony has been restored

between them. There is nothing alleged in the final report

that, the present petitioners have got any political affinity

towards any party except stating that, it was done due to

some political animosity. However, in view of the settlement

there is no possibility of any conviction as the witnesses are

not going to support the case of the prosecution. Further it

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                5

is a fight between two groups of the same community.

People are forgetting the fact that, religion is intended for

protecting the interest of the community and they should

never be overcome by the religion so as to bring hatredness

among members of the same community. They are

expected to follow the preachings of the religion and they

are not expected to use the same as a weapon to bring

hatredness among the members of the community itself.

That is now being going on. However, considering the fact

that the community leaders have taken a role to pacify

these two groups and bring harmony among the community

people, this court with hope and belief that wisdom will fall

on these people and they will not repeat such things in

future so as to cause tranquility among the community

people itself.

            8.    Further in the decision reported in in Gian

Singh V. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                   6

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their  dispute    would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
      High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.  Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                     7

      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
      other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

            9.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that it is a clash

between the same community people and on account of the

settlement harmony has been brought in among the

community people due to the intervention of community

leaders and others and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case, as conviction in such cases will

be remote and it will only a wastage of judicial time, this

court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote

settlement,      which      resulted    in    harmony     among   the

Crl. M.C.No.3040 of 2014
                                8

community people and with the hope and belief that they

will not repeat the same in future to cause nuisance within

the community people as such.

            So this criminal, miscellaneous case is allowed

and further proceedings in C.C.523/2013 pending before

the Judicial First class Magistrate's Court - II, Hosdurg, as

against the petitioners is hereby quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary further action.

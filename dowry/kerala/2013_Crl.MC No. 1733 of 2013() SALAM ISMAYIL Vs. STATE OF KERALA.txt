                 ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 3rd day of June, 2013

                              O R D E R

           The above M.C. is filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to quash Annexure A1

and all proceeding pursuant to C.C.No.391 of 2009 on the file of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur, which was instituted

upon the report in Crime No.42/2008 of the Kuttipuram Police

Station.

      2. C.C.No.391 of 2009 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Tirur was instituted upon the report filed

on completing the investigation in Crime No. 42/2008 of the

Kuttipuram Police Station. The allegation in the above crime is

that on 28.1.2008 at about 4.45 p.m., the accused, who are the

petitioners herein, obstructed the de facto complainant, who is

the second respondent herein, with the intention of causing harm

to them and the first accused is alleged to have hit the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.1733 of 2013

                               :-2-:

complainant with his hand and an iron pipe and the second accused

is alleged to have cut him with a knife and hit the others with their

hands and thus, all the accused acted in common intention to cause

harm to the de facto complainant and others and thus, they have

committed        the   offences    punishable     under     Sections

143,147,148,341,323,324 and 149 of the I.P.C.           During the

pendency of the above case, according to the petitioners,        the

matter is settled out of court. To show the settlement, along with

the above M.C., Annexure A2 affidavit sworn into by the second

respondent, who is the de facto complainant is filed before this

Court.

      3.    The counsel appearing for the second respondent

submitted that the second respondent/the de facto complainant

does not intend to prosecute any further against the petitioners who

are the accused in the above case. As I am satisfied with the

submission made by the counsel for the petitioners and the second

Crl.M.C.No.1733 of 2013

                                 :-3-:

respondent, which are supported by Annexures A1 and A2

affidavit, I am of the view that though non-compoundable offence

is involved, it is the duty of this Court to promote the compromise

entered into between the parties to the dispute and to permit to

materialise the settlement arrived, especially in the light of the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v.

State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], wherein it was         held

that it is within the powers of a High Court to quash criminal

proceedings, involving non compoundable offences, on the basis

of compromise reached between the offender and the victim. In

the said decision, it is also held by the Apex Court that when the

criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing

particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,

mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transaction for the

offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc.

Crl.M.C.No.1733 of 2013

                                :-4-:

            In the result, this Criminal M.C. is allowed quashing

Annexure A1 and all proceeding pursuant to C.C.No.391 of 2009

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur.

            This Criminal M.C. is allowed as above.

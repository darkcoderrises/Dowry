                   B.A.No. 4094 OF 2013 ()

             Dated this the 17th day of June, 2013

                             O R D E R
                            ~~~~~~~


      This is an application for anticipatory bail filed under

Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, the

Code').

      2.   Petitioners, two in number, are proceeded as accused

Nos. 1 and 2 with another in Crime No.32 of 2013 of Pampa

Police Station registered for offence punishable under Section

438 of the Code read with 34 of Indian Penal Code. Crime was

registered on a complaint given before police by the wife of the

first accused alleging matrimonial cruelty and harassment and

inflicting of physical and mental torture demanding dowry by

the accused persons, her husband, his sister and son of the

sister. The investigation over that crime is pending and, at this

stage, petitioners have moved the petition seeking the

discretionary relief of pre-arrest bail.

      3.   Learned counsel for petitioners submits that they

have been falsely implicated in the crime on baseless

allegations. They are prepared to co-operate with the

B.A.No.4094/2013                  2


investigation of the crime, is the further submission of counsel.

Learned Public Prosecutor reports that the investigation is now

continued only against first accused deleting Section 34 of IPC

and removing the other two accused (A2 and A3) named in the

F.I.R.  Case Diary has been produced for my perusal.         After

looking into the complaint and other materials covered by the

Case Diary, I find arrest and custodial interrogation of the first

petitioner (A1), who is now proceeded as the sole accused in the

crime, for fair investigation and its completion, is not necessary.

In such circumstances, first petitioner can be granted the relief

canvassed imposing adequate conditions safeguarding the

investigation.

            (i)   In the event of arrest of first
            petitioner in connection with the above
            crime, he is directed to be released on
            executing a bond for Rs.10,000/- with one
            solvent surety for the like sum.

            (ii)  First petitioner shall report before
            the investigating officer at the Station as
            and when directed, if his presence is
            demanded     for   smooth    completion   of
            investigation of the crime.


      Petition is partly allowed as indicated above granting relief

to the first petitioner alone. No orders are required in the case

B.A.No.4094/2013              3


of second and third petitioners since they are stated to have

been removed from the array of the accused in the crime.

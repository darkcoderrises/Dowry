             Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
           --------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 30th day of July, 2013

                               ORDER

       The above petitions are filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioners, who are the accused in C.C.Nos.323 of 2012

and 634 of 2011 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod for the offences punishable under Sections

143, 147, 148, 341, 323 & 324 read with Section 149 of I.P.C.

with a prayer to quash Annexure-I charge in C.C.No.323 of

2012 and Annexure-I charge in C.C.No.634 of 2011 on the files

of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod as the

matter is settled out of court.

     2.   In Crl.M.C.No.3188 of 2013, the prosecution case is

that, on 20/10/2011 at about 6 p.m. accused Nos.1 to 5 due to

previous enmity towards CWs.1 and 2, formed themselves into

an unlawful assembly and wrongfully restrained CWs.1 and 2

and accused Nos.1 and 2 beat CW.1 with their hand and stick

and accused No.2 beat CW.2 with his hand and stick and

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                              :-2-:


accused Nos.4 and 5 caused abrasions on the body of CWs.1

and 2 with a knife at a place called Theruvath.

      3.  In Crl.M.C.No.3192 of 2013, the prosecution case is

that, on 25/10/2011 at about 7.30 p.m., accused Nos.1, 2 and 4

identifiable persons, formed themselves into an unlawful

assembly and wrongfully restrained and attacked CW.1 with

deadly weapons and hand and caused bodily injuries to him

near Maddona Hostel at Thalankara.

     4.   As the parties to the dispute are more or less the

same and the matter is settled, according to me, the above

M.Cs. can be heard together and disposed of by a common

order.

     5.   Crl.M.C.No.3188 of 2013 is directed against the

proceedings in C.C.No.323 of 2012 which was instituted upon

a report in Crime No.977 of 2011 of Kasaragod Police Station.

The petitioners herein are the accused in the above crime and

the de facto complainant therein is the second respondent and

3rd respondent is one of the injured. Whereas Crl.M.C.No.3192

of 2013 is directed against the proceedings in C.C.No.634 of

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                              :-3-:


2011 of the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasaragod

which is instituted upon a report in Crime No.996 of 2011 of

Kasaragod Police Station.      The petitioners are the accused

therein and the second respondent is the de facto complainant

in the above crime. It can be seen that, both are case and

counter case. Now, according to the petitioners in the above

M.C.s, the matter is settled out of court with the de facto

complainant as well as the injured. Respondents 2 and 3, who

are respectively the de facto complainant and the injured has

filed Annexures-II and III affidavits respectively. Similarly, in

Crl.M.C.No.3192 of 2013 the de facto complainant, who is the

second respondent has filed Annexure-A2 affidavit.

     6. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

     7.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                              :-4-:


proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

     8. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on the

basis of specific instruction received    from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

     9. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-II affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

     10.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

323 & 324 read with Section 149 of I.P.C. which are more or

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                                    :-5-:


pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the

real parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the contesting respondents, it appears to me that

the de facto complainant and the injured has no further

grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to

note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in

which the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

        depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

        no category can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                                       :-6-:


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

Crl.M.C.Nos.3188 & 3192 of 2013
                              :-7-:


matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, these Criminal M.C.s can be allowed

granting the reliefs as sought for.

        In the result, these Crl.M.C.s are allowed, quashing

Annexure-I charge in C.C.No.323 of 2012 and Annexure-I

charge in C.C.No.634 of 2011 on the files of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.

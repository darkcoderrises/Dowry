                    Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013
              ----------------------------------------
              Dated this the 8th day of July, 2013

                            O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.P.No.96 of

2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam

which is a case instituted upon the police report [in Crime

No.564 of 2009 of Anchalummoodu Police Station] for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the Annexure-1

FIR and Annexure-2 Final Report in Crime No.564 of 2009 of

Anchalummoodu Police Station and all further proceedings

pursuant to the same including C.P.No.96 of 2012 on the file

of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam as the matter

is settled out of court.

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that on

15.10.2009 connected with the dispute regarding the election

to the Thrikkadavoor Temple Committee, the petitioners along

with 6 other unidentifiable persons formed themselves into an

unlawful assembly and assaulted the de facto complainant and

thereby committed the offences punishable under Sections

Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013        2

143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 r/w 149 of IPC. Now the case of

the petitioners are that as the petitioners and the second

respondent are friends and issue        arose out of political

animosity the matter is settled out of court.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the second respondent. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

        4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

        5. The learned counsel for the second respondent who

on the basis of specific instruction received       from the

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioners and he has no grievance against them.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. The second

Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013         3

respondent who is the de facto complainant sworn into

Annexure-III affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w 149 of IPC which are more or less personal in nature

and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled

the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

second respondent, it appears to me that the the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners

accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013           4

                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:      the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.        Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
         has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend on
         the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having
          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
          flavour stand on different footing for the
          purposes     of  quashing,  particularly   the
          offences arising from commercial, financial,
          mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of
          matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
          family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the
          parties have resolved their entire dispute.
          In this category of cases, High Court may
          quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
          because of the compromise between the
          offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction    is  remote    and    bleak  and
          continuation of criminal case would put
          accused to great oppression and prejudice
          and extreme injustice would be caused to

Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013        5

         him by not quashing the criminal case
         despite   full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -1 FIR       and Annexure -2 Final Report in Crime

No.564 of 2009 of Anchalummoodu Police Station and all

further   proceedings    pending  against   the  petitioners   in

Crl.M.C.No.2776 of 2013       6

C.P.No.96 of 2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

1, Kollam.

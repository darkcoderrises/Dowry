              Bail Appl. No. 5832 of 2013

      Dated this the 26th day of September 2013

                          O R D E R

          Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 4, in Crime

No.1509 of 2013 of Chadayamangalam Police Station for

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A read

with Section 34 of IPC, Sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Dowry

Prohibition Act and Section 66 of the Information

Technology Act.

          2. First petitioner is the husband and 2nd

petitioner   is   the    brother-in-law       of   the  defacto

complainant.

          3. Learned counsel submits that the allegations

are not true.

          4. Learned Public Prosecutor submits that

investigation revealed that no offence under the

Information Technology Act is involved and that apart

from the other offences mentioned, offence under 118(d)

of the Kerala Police Act is involved. It is also submitted

that the Police have filed final report before the

Bail Appl. No. 5832 of 2013   2

Jurisdictional Magistrate on 26.03.2013 and that as per

the final report, the 2nd petitioner is not an accused.

           5. In the light of the above submission, the 2nd

petitioner cannot have any apprehension of arrest. So far

as the  1stpetitioner is concerned, I am inclined to grant

relief since the final report is already filed.

     Resultantly, this petition is allowed as under.

                 1. The petition to the extend it

     concerns the 2nd petitioner is dismissed.

                 2. It is directed that in case the 1st

     petitioner is arrested in Crime No.1509 of 2013

     Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) with two

     sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction

     of the arresting officer.

                  CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014
               =====================
              Dated this the 11th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER
                              --------

      This is an application filed by the accused in Crime No.79

of 2014 of Chandera police station of Kasaragod District to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2.    It is alleged in the petition petitioners were arrayed

as accused in Crime No.79 of 2014 of Chandera police station of

Kasaragod District on the basis of statement given by the first

respondent as defacto complainant alleging offences under

Sections 379, 447, 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal

Code. On the basis of the complaint given by the second

petitioner, another crime was registered as crime No.898 of

2013 of the same police station against the first respondent

alleging offence under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

Now due to the intervention of relatives and well wishers,

matters have been settled between the parties. They have no

grievance against each other now. Crime No.898 of 2013 of

Chandera police station was quashed by this Court as per order

in Crl.M.C.No.1945 of 2014 on the basis of the settlement. No

purpose will be served by proceeding with the case also. Since

it is a crime stage and the some of the offences are non

CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014               2

compoundable in nature neither the police nor the Court will drop

the further proceedings. So they have no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following reliefs:-

       to quash Annexure AII F.I.R in Crime No.79 of 2014 of Chandera

       police station, Kasaragod District.

       3.     First   respondent    appeared    through    counsel   and

submitted that the matter has been settled and they have no

grievance against each other and their dispute has been settled

through mediation and he had filed Annexure-A4 affidavit stating

these facts. Connected crime was also quashed by this Court on

the basis of settlement.

       4.     The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of

the settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction. Further on

account of the settlement, second petitioner and first respondent

have decided to live together as well. So he prayed for allowing the

application.

       5.     The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other crime

between the parties but opposed the application on the ground that

it is in the crime stage.

       6.     It is an admitted fact that the present crime No.79 of

2014 of Chandera police station was registered on the basis of

Annexure-A1 private complaint filed by the first respondent before

CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014           3

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-I, Hosdurg which was

forwarded to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of

Code of Criminal Procedure Code and on receipt the same, the

present Annexure-A2 First Information Report was registered. It is

also an admitted fact that on the basis of a private complaint filed

by the second petitioner herein against the first petitioner and her

relatives which was also forwarded to police for investigation under

Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and after receipt

of the complaint crime No.898 of 2013 of Chandera police station

was registration alleging offences under Section 498A and r/w

Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. It is also an admitted fact that the

second petitioner and the first respondent are wife and husband.

On account of the settlement, they have now decided to reside

together. The matrimonial disputes between the parties as resulted

in the registration of crime. It is also seen from the documents

produced namely Annexure-A3 that the accused in crime No.898 of

2013 of Chandera police station had filed Crl.M.C.1945 of 2014 for

quashing the proceedings and the same was allowed by this Court

on the basis of settlement between the parties. Considering the fact

the matter has been settled between the parties and the defacto

complainant and the second petitioner have decided to live

together and now living together as husband and wife now, there is

no possibility of these parties co-operating with the investigation

CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014            4

and even if ultimately final report is filed, conviction in such cases

will be remote. Since it is a family dispute which resulted in the

registration of crime and it has been settled between the parties

and now they are residing together harmoniously, the Court must

give effect to the settlement and promote the harmony that has

been restored between the parties especially husband and wife

have decided to live together and in such cases pendency of

criminal cases should not be a bar for their relationship to continue

      7.    It is also reported in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab

[2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

           "The position that emerges from the above discussion

     can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in

     quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in

     exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

     from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the

     offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide

     plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

     exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

     power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent

     abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

     quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be

     exercised where the offender and victim have settled their

     dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each

     case and no category can be prescribed.       However, before

     exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard

     to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious

     offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

     dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

     victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the

CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014             5

    dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have

    serious impact on society.         Similarly, any compromise

    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

    offences committed by public servants while working in that

    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

    criminal proceedings involving such offences.          But the

    criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly

    civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of

    quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,

    financial,  mercantile,   civil,   partnership  or   such   like

    transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating

    to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the wrong is

    basically private or personal in nature and the parties have

    resolved their entire dispute. In this category of case, High

    Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

    of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

    possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation

    of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and

    prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by

    not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete

    settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,

    the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

    contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding

    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite

    settlement    and   compromise     between    the  victim  and

    wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

    appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer

    to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

    be well within its jurisdiction      to quash the criminal

    proceeding."

CRL.M.C.NO.3008 OF 2014            6

      8.    In view of the dictum laid on in the above decision and

also considering the fact that it is a family dispute which resulted in

registration of crimes and the matter has been settled between the

parties and one of the crime was quashed by this Court on account

of the settlement and no possibility of conviction in view of the

settlement, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code has to be invoked to

quash the proceedings to promote the harmony that has been

restored in the family and reunion has been happened between

husband and wife and the pendency of this case should not be

hurdle for the same.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in Crime

No.79 of 2014 of Chandera police station of Kasaragod District

against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Hosdurg and to inform the same to the

concerned police station for necessary further action in this regard.

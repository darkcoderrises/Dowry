                       K. RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                    .................................................
                       Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014
                    ..................................................
               Dated this the 1st day of April, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


      This petition is filed by accused Nos.1 to 15 in

C.C.No.95/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial                        Magistrate

Court, Kasaragod to quash the proceedings on the basis of the

settlement under Section               482 of the              Code of    Criminal

procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that on 13.5.2011 at about

7.30 p.m, while the defacto complainant was resting in her

house at Shribagilu village, the accused persons, who were

leading a victory procession in connection with local body

election, abused the defacto complainant and others and inflicted

injuries to some of them and thereby they have committed the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 427, 286

and 294(b) read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed and it

was taken on file as C.C.No.95/2012 and pending before the

Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.                         Now the matter

has been settled between the petitioners and the 1st respondent

Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014                  2

and additional third respondent, who are the                           defacto

complainant and the other affected party and they do not want

to   prosecute the case. Since some of the offences are non

compoundable in nature, they                could not file application for

compounding before          the court below.            No purpose     will be

served by allowing the prosecution to continue in view of the

settlement. So, the petitioners have no other option except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief:

           It is   therefore   most     humbly prayed that this

           Hon'ble    Court    may be       pleased     to    quash

           Annexure A1       Final    Report     and all further

           proceedings     in    C.C.No.95/2012 of          JFCM-I,

           Kasaragod      as against the petitioners/accused

           persons in this petition, in the interest of justice.

      3. Originally       the     defacto       complainant        alone  was

impleaded as the first respondent. Subsequently, as per the

order in Crl.M.A.No.2935/2014,               the husband of the defacto

complainant, who is also an affected party in the incident, has

been impleaded as the additional third respondent.                    Both the

first respondent and the additional third respondent appeared

through counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to intervention of the local people and

Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014          3

harmony has been restored in the society on account of the

settlement. So they do not want to prosecute the case further.

The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in view of

the settlement, no purpose will be served by allowing the

prosecution to continue and conviction in such case is remote.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on             instructions,

submitted that except this case, there is no other case against

the petitioners and they have no other criminal backgrounds as

well but opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the defacto complainant namely the first respondent

herein, a crime was registered against the petitioners alleging

the offences under Sections 143, 147,148, 447,427, 286 and 294

(b) read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.           After

investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed against the

present petitioners and it was taken on file as C.C.No.95/2012

and that is pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Kasaragod. It is seen    from the allegations in the final report

that    there was some incident happened when the           victory

procession of UDF supporters were passing through that

area. Now the matter has been settled between the parties. In

Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014                4

fact, there was no personal enmity between the parties which

resulted in the incident as well. On account of the settlement,

harmony has been restored in the locality. The first respondent

and the additional third          respondent        have filed     affidavits

stating that the matter has been settled due to intervention of

local people and they do not want to prosecute the case                 any

further and the relationship between the petitioners and the

defacto complainant has been restored to the original position

as well on account of the settlement. In view of the settlement,

no purpose will be served by prosecuting the accused as they

will not support the case of the prosecution and conviction in

such cases will be remote.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

             pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

             footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the

             offences    arising   from    commercial,    financial

             mercantile,    civil, partnership    or    such   like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony

             relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where

Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014                5

             the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

             and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash

             criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

             compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case despite full and complete settlement and

             compromise with the victim.       In other words, the

             High Court must consider whether it would be unfair

             or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

             the criminal proceedings or continuation of the

             criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of

             process of law despite settlement and compromise

             between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to

             secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that

             criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to

             the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High

             Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the

             criminal proceeding."

      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

Crl.M.C.No.1657 of 2014              6

between the parties and the petitioners have no              criminal

background and they are not accused in other cases as well

and on account of the settlement, peace and harmony has been

restored in the       locality, no purpose    will be     served  by

proceeding with the case and conviction in such case will be

remote, this Court feels that it is a fit case where power under

Section 482      can be invoked to quash the         proceedings   to

promote peace and harmony that has been restored in the

locality   on    account of the settlement.      So, the petition is

allowed and      further proceeding      in C.C.No.95/2012    (Crime

No.446/2011 of Kasaragod police station) pending before the

Chief    Judicial Magistrate      Court, Kasaragod as against the

petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to       communicate this       order to the

concerned court for necessary further action.

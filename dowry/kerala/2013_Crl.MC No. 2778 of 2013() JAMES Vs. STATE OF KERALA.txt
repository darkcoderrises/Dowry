                  Crl.M.C.No. 2778 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 8th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance of

the petitioners, who are accused Nos.2 to 4 in Crime No. 134

of 2012 of Nilambur Police Station for the offences punishable

under Sections 341, 323, 326 r/w 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash all further proceedings against the petitioners/accused 2

to 4, pursuant to Annexure A1 Charge Sheet in Crime No. 134

of 2012 of Nilambur Police Station and pending as C.C No.314

of 2012 on the files of Judicial first class Magistrate Court,

Nilambur, as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.   The allegation in the above case is that at about

10 pm, on 12.02.2012, while a fare festival in the church was

going on, the accused persons in furtherance of their common

intention to cause grievous hurt, the first accused beat Cws.1

and 3 with a wooden stick and thereby CW1 sustained

grievous injury on head.      According to the allegation the

motive is that CW2 asked permission of the first accused for

playing cards in the compound. The first accused refused

permission and there had a wordy altercation and to wreck

Crl.M.C.No. 2778 of 2013              2

vengeance,              the said incident occurred  and   thus   the

petitioners/accused have committed the offences punishable

under Sections 341, 323, 326 r/w 34 of IPC. Now the case of

the petitioners are that as the petitioners and injured are

belong to same parish, settled the matter.

               3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/s as

well as the respondents 2 to 4. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

               4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above crime.               Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

               5. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4 who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the second

respondent submitted that the above respondent, who is the

de facto complainant/victim/injured do not intend to proceed

any further against the petitioners and they have no grievance

against them.

               6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

Crl.M.C.No. 2778 of 2013               3

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition.            The de

facto complainant and the injured accordingly sworn into a

joint affidavit to produce Annexure-A2. In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the

settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

               7.       Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 341, 323, 326 r/w 34 of

IPC which are more or less personal in nature and no public

interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter.           From the submission made by the counsel for the

respondents 2 to 4, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh

Crl.M.C.No. 2778 of 2013                4

v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-




                        "57. The position that emerges from
               the above discussion can be summarised
               thus:      the power of the High Court in
               quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
               complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
               jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
               power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
               compounding the offences under S.320 of
               the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
               plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
               has to be exercised in accord with the
               guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
               secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
               abuse of the process of any Court. In what
               cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
               proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
               exercised where the offender and victim
               have settled their dispute would depend on
               the facts and circumstances of each case
               and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

               "......... But the criminal cases having
               overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
               flavour stand on different footing for the
               purposes      of quashing,   particularly   the
               offences arising from commercial, financial,
               mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
               transactions or the offences arising out of
               matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
               family disputes where the wrong is basically
               private or personal in nature and the
               parties have resolved their entire dispute.
               In this category of cases, High Court may
               quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

Crl.M.C.No. 2778 of 2013              5

               because of the compromise between the
               offender and victim, the possibility of
               conviction     is remote   and   bleak  and
               continuation of criminal case would put
               accused to great oppression and prejudice
               and extreme injustice would be caused to
               him by not quashing the criminal case
               despite    full and complete settlement and
               compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

               In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

First Class Magistrate Court, Nilambur .

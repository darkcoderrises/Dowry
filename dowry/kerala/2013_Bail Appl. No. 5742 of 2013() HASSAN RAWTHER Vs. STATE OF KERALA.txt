              Bail Application No.5742 OF 2013
              ---------------------------------------
         Dated this the 3rd day of September, 2013.


                            O R D E R


      The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.301/2013 of

Kunnikkode Police Station who is alleged to have committed the

offences punishable under Sections 498A, 294(b), 323, 506(II),

494 and 495 of Indian Penal Code.

      2. The marriage between the petitioner herein and the de

facto complainant was solemnized on 17.06.2012. According to

the de facto complainant, ever since after marriage, she has been

harassed, tortured and ill treated by the petitioner demanding

dowry.     Ultimately, on 20.02.2013, the petitioner again

demanded money from the parents of the de facto complainant

and since they are not able to provide the funds required by him,

she was brutally manhandled.         It is pointed out that the

petitioner had married again during the subsistence of marriage

with the de facto complainant.

      3. The petitioner would say that he is innocent and has

B.A.No.5742/2013                  2


been falsely implicated in the matter. According to him, soon

after the marriage, he came to know that the de facto

complainant was suffering from acute epilepsy and that fact was

concealed by them.      When that was brought to the notice of the

parents of the de facto complainant, they initially agreed to do

something in the matter. But later they retracted. Thereafter

they resorted to intimidate and threaten him.        The petitioner

would say that in fact, on 07.02.2013, he was attacked by a

group of persons whom he alleges are henchmen of the de facto

complainant's parents and he was manhandled and they deprived

of his cash. It is also pointed out that he has lodged a complaint

on the basis of which Crime No.142/2013 of Pangode Police

Station was registered. Realising that things may go against her,

a false complaint has been lodged. According to the petitioner,

the allegations against him are without any basis. He therefore

seeks pre-arrest bail.

       4.     Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the petition and

pointed out that the investigation is at an infant stage.

       5.     The offences alleged against the petitioner include

B.A.No.5742/2013                  3


offences punishable under Sections 494 and 495 IPC. It appears

that a private complaint was filed by the de facto complainant

and the same was forwarded for investigation under Section 156

(3) Cr.P.C and on the basis of which, a crime was registered. The

allegation against the petitioner seems to be that he, after

marriage,       began to   demand    more   dowry    and   he    also

misappropriated the amount and ornaments given to the de facto

complainant for her own purpose. He continued to ask for money

and he is alleged to have beaten up the de facto complainant. It

is significant to notice that no wound certificate as such has been

produced in order to support the allegation that on 20.02.2013,

she was brutally manhandled.

       6. The contention of the petitioner that there was an attack

from the side of the parents of the de facto complainant and a

complaint was filed by him in that regard and on the basis of

which Crime No.142/2013 was registered and it was subsequent

to that the present complaint has been filed by the de facto

complainant cannot be easily brushed aside.

       Considering the totality of the circumstances, it is felt that

B.A.No.5742/2013                    4


this is a fit case where extra ordinary jurisdiction of this Court

needs to be exercised in favour of the petitioner. Therefore, the

application is allowed on the following conditions:

       i)     The petitioner shall surrender before the Investigating

              Officer   on  or   before   10.09.2013    who,    after

              interrogation, shall produce him before the Court

              concerned, which court, on application for bail being

              moved by the petitioner, shall release him on bail on

              his executing bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees

              Twenty Five Thousand only) with two solvent sureties

              for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Court

              concerned.

       ii)    The Court concerned shall ensure the identity of the

              sureties and also the veracity of the tax receipts

              produced by them.

       iii)   The petitioner shall report before the Investigating

              Officer on every Wednesday between 9 a.m and

              10 a.m until further orders.

       iv)    The petitioner shall not tamper or attempt to tamper

              with the evidence or influence or try to influence the

              witness.

       v)     If any of the condition is violated, the bail granted

              shall stand cancelled and the Court concerned, on

B.A.No.5742/2013                      5


              being satisfied of the said fact, may take such steps as

              are available to it in law.

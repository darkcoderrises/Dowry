                   .................................................
                     Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014
                  ..................................................
              Dated this the 28th day of May, 2014.

                               O R D E R


     This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by the first

accused in Crime No.534/2010 of Thamarassery police station,

Kozhikode district and the sole accused in C.C.No.1076/2013

of Judicial First    Class Magistrate Court, Thamarassery                       to

quash the proceedings on the basis of a settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner was

originally arrayed as the first accused in Crime No.534/2010 of

Thamarassery police station which was registered on the basis

of a statement given by the defacto complainant - the                         first

respondent herein along with other accused persons                        alleging

offences under Sections 143,147,148, 341, 506 (ii) and 427

read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. Subsequently,

after investigation final report was filed against two accused

persons    alone but showing               the offences             under Sections

143,147,148, 341, 506 (ii) and 427 read with Section 149 of

the Indian Penal Code and the case was originally taken on file

Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014                 2

as C.C.No.598/2010 and since the present petitioner did not

appear, the case against the second accused in that case was

proceeded with and he was acquitted as per judgment dated

11.12.2013. The case against the present petitioner was split

up and refiled as C.C.No.1076/2013.

        3. Now the matter has been settled between the parties

and the defacto complainant has no grievance against the

petitioner. In view of the settlement, no purpose will be served

by proceeding with the case. Since some of the offences are

non     compoundable in nature, he could not file                 application

before the court below. So he has no other remedy except to

approach this Court seeking the following relief:

                    In  the above  circumstances, it is most  humbly

            prayed that this Honourable Court may be pleased to quash

            the Annexure -A1 FIR and Annexure-A4 final report in

            Crime No.534/2010 pin Thamarassery police station now

            pending as C.C.No.1076/2013 and all further proceedings

            in the above case pending on the files of Judicial First


            Class Magistrate Court, Thamarassery.


        4. The first respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that in view of the settlement, he does not want to

proceed against the petitioner and he has no objection in

Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014            3

quashing the proceedings.

         5. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction

and he prayed for allowing the application.

        6. The learned     Public Prosecutor, on instructions,   as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner and the case against the second accused

has       already been ended in acquittal, but opposed the

application.

        7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the petitioner, Crime No. 534/2010 of Thamarassery

police      station was   registered  against  two named persons

including the petitioner and three identifiable persons alleging

offences under Sections 143,147,148, 341, 506 (ii) and 427

read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, final report was filed alleging some offences, but

against the present petitioner and the second accused who

were also named in the First Information Report. It is also an

admitted fact that as per Annexure-A5 judgment, the case

against the second accused was tried and ended in acquittal.

Now the matter has been settled between the defacto

Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014                  4

complainant and the petitioner. This fact was mentioned in

Annexure-A6 affidavit filed by the first respondent as well. It

is also mentioned in the affidavit that there was some dispute

regarding the running of quarry and                   crusher unit and the

incident occurred in connection with the same and now the

entire dispute          has been settled as well. In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction as neither the

defacto complainant nor his witnesses will likely                   to support

the case of the prosecution as well.

        8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014                   5

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite  full and   complete    settlement  and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


        9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the case against the second

accused has already been ended in acquittal after trial and in

view of the settlement, possibility of conviction as against the

petitioner is remote and              the entire incident happened        in

connection with the functioning of crusher unit in the locality

Crl.M.C.No.2322 of 2014              6

which has been settled between the parties on account of

intervention of members of the locality, this Court feels that

this is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings.


        10. So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.No.1076/2013 (Crime No.534/2010 of Thamarassery

police station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate,

Thamarassery as against the petitioner is quashed.

        Office is directed to      communicate this order  to the

concerned court immediately.

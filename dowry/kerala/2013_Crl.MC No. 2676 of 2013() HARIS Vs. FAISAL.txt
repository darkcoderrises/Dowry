                      Crl.M.C.No. 2676 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 8th day of July, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 17 in C.C.No.712 of 2012

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nadapuram, which is a

case instituted upon the police report in Crime No. 60 of 2013 of

Valayam Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

143,147,148,341,323,324 read with 149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to

quash Annexure-II Police Charge and all further proceedings in

C.C.No.712/12 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Nadapuram against the petitioners as the matter is settled out of court.

        2. The allegation in the above case is that on 22.2.2012, the

accused persons in furtherance of the common intention assembled

unlawfully and attacked and assaulted the defacto complianant at

Crl.M.C.No.2676 of 2013


                                  :-2-:

different places and thereby committed the offences punishable under

Sections 143,147,148,341,323,324 read with 149 of I.P.C. and now,

the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and he has no

grievance against them.

Crl.M.C.No.2676 of 2013


                                  :-3-:

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.     I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only    Sections 143,147,148,341,323,324 read with 149 of I.P.C.

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the first respondent, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/accused

Crl.M.C.No.2676 of 2013


                                             :-4-:

in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported

in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                       "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

            can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

            criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

            jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

            criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code.       Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

            limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

            engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

            quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

Crl.M.C.No.2676 of 2013


                                            :-5-:

         dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

         commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

         transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

         etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

         this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

         its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         8.      According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view that

as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of

this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

Crl.M.C.No.2676 of 2013


                                  :-6-:

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding

with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting

the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure-II

Police Charge and all further proceedings in C.C.No.712/12 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nadapuram against

the petitioners.

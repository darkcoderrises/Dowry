                 Crl. R.P. No: 1209 of 2007
            ------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 17th day of December, 2012


                           O R D E R

     The petitioner-husband was convicted of the offence

under section 498A of IPC and was sentenced to simple

imprisonment for two years and to pay Rs.3,000/- as fine.

The appellate court reduced the substantive sentence to

simple imprisonment for one year.            But the sentence

regarding fine was maintained.




     2.  The learned counsel for the revision petitioner

submits that there is only the solitary testimony of PW1 -

wife. Though PWs 2 to 4 are stated to be the occurrence

witnesses, they did not support the prosecution. PW5 is the

doctor who proved Ext.P2 - wound certificate.

     3.  It is argued by Sri. Deerendra Krishnan, the

learned counsel for the revision petitioner, that the very fact

Crl.R.P. No: 1209/2007
                               -2-



that all the inmates of the house were arrayed as accused in

the complaint given by her to the Police itself would show

that she was trying to pressurize the petitioner herein and

the other members of his family to the demand made by

her. The accused was working in gulf for some time. She

stayed     with   the  petitioner for  about   two  months.

Thereafter, he left for gulf. He had to come back as he was

not having proper visa. So, according to the petitioner, he

wanted to obtain a new visa.       If, for that purpose, the

petitioner had demanded some money from his wife or from

the parents of his wife, it cannot be said that it was

demanded as dowry. Therefore, according to the learned

counsel, even if the evidence given by PW1 is accepted, the

demand so made for money cannot be termed as demand

for dowry.      And if that be so, that part of the evidence

cannot help the prosecution to prove that PW1 was

subjected to cruelty.

Crl.R.P. No: 1209/2007
                              -3-




      4.    It is also submitted by the learned counsel that

PW1 was having relationship with another man and

subsequently that man committed suicide. Thereafter, PW1

was married by another man and she is now living happily

with that man.       But no document has been produced to

substantiate that submission.




      5.    Apart from the evidence of PW1 there is no other

evidence to show that she was subjected to cruelty. But

there is Ext.P2, the wound certificate proved by PW5, to

show that she was beaten by the petitioner. Her father,

mother or near relatives who could have stated about the

alleged cruelty, were not examined.        Those who were

examined did not support the prosecution. Since, part of

the allegation made by PW1 as regards the complicity of A1

to A5 was found against, it has to be said that the evidence

Crl.R.P. No: 1209/2007
                               -4-



given by PW1 was not wholly reliable but only partly

reliable.    If so, it should be corroborated by some other

evidence. No such evidence is there. Hence, it cannot be

said that there is sufficient evidence to prove the cruelty as

envisaged under section 498A of IPC.          The cruelty as

envisaged under section 498A should be one which should

drive a woman to commit suicide. Such an allegation is not

there nor is the evidence given by PW1 sufficient to

substantiate the allegation. The evidence would only show

that when the petitioner was contemplating to go abroad for

obtaining visa, he had requested for money.

      6.    The petitioner also relies upon Ext.D1 the

document as per which all the house hold articles, pots etc

belonging to PW1 were returned. It        is    argued     by

Sri.Deerendra Krishnan, learned counsel for the revision

petitioner, that if as a matter of fact the gold ornaments

allegedly obtained by the petitioner were with the petitioner

Crl.R.P. No: 1209/2007
                             -5-



then certainly mention would have been made in Ext.D1

regarding the gold ornaments which were illegally retained

by the petitioner.     The conspicuous absence of any

averment regarding the gold ornaments in Ext.D1 would

also strengthen the case of the petitioner that the allegation

that he had retained gold ornaments of the PW1 is nothing

but a sheer myth.




      7.    Though the evidence regarding the cruelty so as

to attract offence under section 498A is not sufficient,

because of the reasons mentioned above the petitioner may

have to be found guilty of the offence under section 323 of

IPC, since that part of the evidence given by PW1 is

supported by Ext.P2 - the wound certificate proved through

PW5. Since PW1 had sustained simple hurt, the petitioner

has to be found guilty of the offence under section 323 of

IPC.

Crl.R.P. No: 1209/2007
                               -6-



      8.    In the result, this Criminal Revision Petition is

disposed of as stated below:

      The conviction and sentence passed against the

petitioner for offence under section 498A of IPC is set aside.

But he is found guilty of the offence under section 323 of

IPC and he is convicted thereunder.       The petitioner is

sentenced to imprisonment for the period he had already

undergone and also to pay Rs.5,000/- as compensation to

PW1, in default whereof the petitioner will undergo simple

imprisonment for one month. The petitioner is granted one

month time to pay the amount of compensation.

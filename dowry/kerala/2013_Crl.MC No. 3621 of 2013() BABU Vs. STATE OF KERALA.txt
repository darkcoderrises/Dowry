                Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                 -------------------------------
        Dated this the 27th day of August, 2013.


                         O R D E R


       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is accused No.3 in

C.C.No.665/03 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

I, Mavelikkara, which is a case instituted upon the police

report [in Crime No.171/98 of Vallikkunnam Police Station]

for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 427

and 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings in Annexure-1 final report in the above crime,

as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.   The allegation in the above case is that due to

the enmity towards CW1 and others, the first accused

caught hold of CW1 and pushed him out of the hall of the

Govt. Model U.P.School, where the Grama Sabha was

Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                              2

going on at Pallickal village in Bharanickavu Panchayath.

There occurred a difference of opinion with regard to the

1st accused and the de facto complainant. So, the de facto

complainant gave complaint against the 1st accused in the

grama sabha. Due to that enmity, there occurred a tussle

between two groups. The specific allegation against the

petitioner is that A-2 to 4 wrongfully restrained CW-6 at the

school compound and slapped him on his cheek and fisted

him on his back and A2, 3 and 4 beat CW-1 on his back.

During the incident, a gold chain and watch belonging to

CW-1 were broken and CW-2 sustained a loss of `200/-.

Thus, the accused committed offence u/s.341, 323, 427 and

34 of IPC.       Now, the case of the petitioner is that the

matter is settled out of court with the 2nd respondent/de

facto complainant and 3rd respondent/the injured, who

sworn into Annexures-3 series of affidavits.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                               3

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

         5.      The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who is the de facto complainant and the

injured respectively do not intends to proceed any further

against the petitioner and they have no grievance against

him.

         6.    I    have carefully considered   the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                              4

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341,

323, 427 and 34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant and the injured have no

further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                                    5

KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has

held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and

Crl.M.C.No.3621 of 2013
                                   6

         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.            Thus,

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

                                 7

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-1 final report and all further proceedings

pending      against    the  petitioner in L.P.No.37/05 in

C.C.No.665/03 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

I, Mavelikkara, [in Crime No.171/98 of Vallikkunnam Police

Station.

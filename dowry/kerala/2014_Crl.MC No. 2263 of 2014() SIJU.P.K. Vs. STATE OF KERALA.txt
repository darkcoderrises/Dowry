                       Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014
                    ..................................................
               Dated this the 26th day of May, 2014.

                                 O R D E R


      This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is filed by the petitioner,

who is the 4th accused in Crime No.400/2009 of Payyannur

police station and the sole accused now in C.C.No.254/2014

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Payyannur, to quash the proceedings on the basis of a settlement

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner along with

others    were arrayed as           accused in            Crime No.400/2009 of

Payyannur police station which was registered on the basis of a

statement given by the second respondent alleging offences

under sections 341, 323, 326 read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code. After investigation, final report was filed and the

case was originally taken on file as C.C.No.370/2011 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur.

Accused 1 to 3     appeared and they were tried and acquitted by

the court as per order dated 14.2.2014. Since the present

petitioner did not appear, the case against him was split up and

Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014                2

refiled as C.C. 254/2014 and now that is pending before that

court. The matter has been settled between the parties and on

account of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction.

Since some of the offences are non compoundable in nature,

they could not file application before the court below. So, the

petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this court

seeking the following relief.

                 In the above      facts and circumstances, this

          Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash Annexure A2

          charge     sheet and      all  further proceedings in

          C.C.No.254/2014 pending      before the Judicial First

          Class Magistrate     Court,    Payyannur  against the

          petitioner, allowing this Criminal M.C.

      3. The second respondent/defacto complainant appeared

through counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parties and he has no objection in allowing the

application as he has no grievance now and                  their original

relationship has been restored. The counsel for the petitioner

also submitted that when the trial of the case as against

accused 1 to 3 was conducted, the matter has been settled

and the defacto complainant himself has admitted that none of

the accused had committed any offence. It was on that basis

Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014          3

that the other accused persons have been acquitted. Now the

defacto complainant has no case that the present accused had

done anything against him. So he prayed for allowing the

application.

      4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioner and he has no criminal back ground, but

opposed the application.

      5. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was originally

shown as the 4th accused in Crime No.400/2009 of Payyannur

police station and after investigation final report was filed and

that case was originally taken on file as C.C.370/2011 alleging

offences under Sections 341, 323 and 326 read with Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code against four accused persons including

the present petitioner. It is also an admitted fact that accused

1 to 3 were tried and acquitted as per Annexure A3 judgment.

Now the matter has been settled between the petitioner and the

defacto complainant, who is the second respondent herein. It is

also seen from Annexure-A3 judgment that during cross

examination, the defacto complainant had given a clean chit to

the accused persons, who appeared and faced trial. It appears

Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014                 4

that even at that time, the matter has been settled between the

parties and that was the reason why he had not supported the

case of the prosecution in the cross examination though he had

deposed in favour of the prosecution in the chief examination.

Further, the learned Magistrate after considering the evidence,

acquitted the accused persons, who faced trial as well. Now

the matter has been settled between the petitioner and the

defacto complainant. The defacto complainant filed Annexure-

A4 affidavit stating these facts. In view of the settlement, even

if the case is allowed to proceed with, no purpose will be served

as the parties will not support the case of the prosecution and it

is only wastage of time to allow the prosecution to continue

as against the petitioner in the circumstances of the case.

Further on account of the settlement, earlier friendship               and

relationship has been restored between the parties.

      6. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

            "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

            the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014                  5

            arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

            partnership or such like transactions or the offences

            arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

            family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

            personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

            entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

            may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

            of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

            possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

            continuation of criminal case would put accused to

            great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

            would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

            case    despite   full and   complete    settlement  and

            compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

            Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

            contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

            criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

            proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

            law despite settlement and compromise between the

            victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

            of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

            an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

            affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

            jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

Crl.M.C.No.2263 of 2014            6


      7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and in view of the settlement, possibility of

conviction is remote even if the trial of the case is allowed to

proceed with and the relationship has been restored between

parties on account of the settlement, this Court feels that this

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings

to promote the settlement and           the harmony that has been

restored between the parties.


      8. So, the application is allowed and further proceedings

in C.C.No.254/2014 (Crime No.400/2009 of Payyannur police

station) pending before the         Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Payyannur, as against the petitioner is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.

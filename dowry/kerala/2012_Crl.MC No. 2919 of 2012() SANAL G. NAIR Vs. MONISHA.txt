       Petitioners are the accused in a pending

case on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the

First Class, Thiruvalla. First petitioner is the

son and second petitioner mother. Both of them

have been indicted on a complaint filed by the 1st

respondent, wife of the 1st petitioner imputing

matrimonial cruelty and harassment demanding

dowry.   Now, the parties have resolved their

disputes and the spouses are living together

under the same roof is the submission made to

quash the criminal proceedings against the

petitioners/ accused.

Crl.M.C.No.2919 of 2012

                       :: 2 ::


        2.  Learned    Public  Prosecutor,   after

getting instructions, also reports that the

spouses are now living together resolving their

matrimonial disputes.      In such circumstances,

continuation of the criminal proceedings against

the petitioners, husband and his mother on a

complaint given by the 1st respondent wife would

result     only    in  rupturing    the   renewed

matrimonial     relationship   of   the   spouses.

Settlement effected by the parties resolving

their disputes can be taken due note of and

recognised where it is shown that the crime has

been registered on account of the matrimonial

disputes between the spouses.

        3.    Criminal proceedings against the

petitioners/accused in C.C.No.219 of 2012 on the

file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class,

Thiruvalla, Ottapalam of are quashed exercising

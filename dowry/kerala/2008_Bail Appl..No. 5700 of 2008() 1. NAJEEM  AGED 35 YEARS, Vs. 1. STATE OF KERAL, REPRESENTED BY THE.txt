                          B.A.No.5700 of 2008
                 -------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 14th day of October, 2008



                                 O R D E R


      This petition is for anticipatory bail.

      2.   The alleged offences are under Sections 498(A) and

34 IPC. Petitioner is the first accused in the crime. He is the

husband of the defacto complainant. There are two more accused

in the crime. According to prosecution, petitioner and the

defacto complainant were married on 6.4.2008 and she was

ill-treated by the petitioner and others by demanding more

dowry and she was ousted from the house in July 2008.

      3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioner is absolutely innocent of the allegations made and

there are chances for a settlement and hence, anticipatory bail

may be granted.

      4.   This petition is opposed. Learned public prosecutor

submitted that the marital relationship came to an end within

three months of the marriage. The marriage was in April 2008

and the parties were living separately since July 2008.               The

BA No.5700/08                     2



matrimonial relationship was broken because of the physical and

mental cruelty inflicted on the defacto complainant by the

petitioner who is the husband and also his close relative. It is

not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail, it is submitted.

      5.    On hearing both sides, I am satisfied that on

consideration of the nature of allegations made, it is not a fit

case to grant anticipatory bail. The complaint was filed on

21.8.2008 and petitioner is not available for investigation.

           Hence, petitioner is directed to surrender before the

           Investigating Officer within seven days from today and

           co-operate with the investigation.


      With this direction, this petition is dismissed.




                                                   K.HEMA, JUDGE

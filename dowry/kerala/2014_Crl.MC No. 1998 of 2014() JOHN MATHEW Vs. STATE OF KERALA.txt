    ==============================
                 Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 08th day of April, 2014.


                           O R D E R

     This is an application filed by the accused Nos.1 and 3 in

Crime No.453/1988 of Pathanamthitta Police Station now

pending as C.C.No.340/10 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate   Court,   No-II,   Pathanamthitta,     to  quash   he

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners were the

original accused Nos.1 and 3 in Crime No.453/1988 of

Pathanamthitta Police Station which was originated on the

basis of the statement given by de facto complainant namely

the second respondent herein alleging offences under Sections

323, 324, 452 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, final report was filed and it was originally

taken as file as C.C.No.378/1988 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate No-II, Pathanamthitta.         The second

accused alone faced trial in that case and as per Annexure B

judgment he was acquitted and the case against accused

Nos.1 and 3 was refiled as C.C.No.311/1994 and thereafter, it

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014     :  2   :

was transferred to register of long pending cases and when

they surrendered before the court below, it was refiled as

C.C.No.340/10 and now pending before Judicial First Class

Magistrate No-II, Pathanamthitta.           In the meantime, the

matter has been settled between the de facto complainant and

other injured who were shown as respondents 2 and 3

respectively. In view of the settlement, there is no possibility

of any conviction. Further, even as against the third accused

as per Annexure B judgment, the court below found that the

prosecution has failed to prove the case against the accused

who faced the trial beyond reasonable doubt. Since some of

the offences are non-compoundable in nature, they could not

file the applications before the court below for compounding

and so they have no other option except to approach this court

seeking the following relief:

           "To allow this criminal miscellaneous case and quash

     Annexure A final report in Crime No.453/1988 of

     Pathanamthitta Police Station and proceedings pursuant

     to the same, now pending as C.C.No.340/2010 on the file

     of   the    Judicial  First  Class    Magistrate  Court-II,

     Pathanamthitta, so as to secure the interest of justice."

      3.     Second and third respondent appeared through

Counsel and submitted that they have settled the dispute with

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014  : 3   :

the accused and co-accused has already been acquitted by the

court and so, the settlement was arrived at due to the

intervention of relatives and well wishers in the locality. They

are neighbours as well. So, they do not want to proceed with

the prosecution.       They also stated that they have filed

Annexure C and D affidavits stating these facts. The Counsel

for the petitioners also submitted that in view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of conviction and so he

payed for allowing the application.

      4.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court, submitted that except this case, there is

no other case against the petitioners and the case against the

2nd accused ended in acquittal but opposed the application.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent as de facto

complainant, Crime No.453/1988 of Pathanamthitta           Police

Station was registered alleging offences under Sections 452,

324, 323 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and after

investigation, Annexure A final report was filed and it was

originally taken on file as C.C.No.378/1988 and second

accused alone faced trial and he was acquitted by the court

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014   :  4  :

below which is evident from Annexure B judgment in which it

was mentioned that, the prosecution has failed to prove the

case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and

disbelieved the case of the prosecution. The case against the

present petitioners was originally refiled as C.C.No.311/94 and

since they did not appear, the case was transferred to the

register of long pending cases and thereafter, when they

appeared before the court below, it was refiled and now

pending as C.C.No.340/2010 before that court.          Now, the

matter has been settled between the petitioners and

respondents 2 and 3 who are the de facto complainant and

other injured in the case. In view of the settlement, there is

no possibility of conviction as they will not support the case of

the prosecution. Further, it is seen from the affidavits filed by

respondents 2 and 3 that they are neighbours and on account

of the intervention of mediators and well wishers in the

locality, the matter has been settled and there relationship has

been restored as before. So, proceeding with the case will be

of no use and it will be only a wastage of judicial time.

      6.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014     :  5  :

follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014      :  6   :

      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


      7.      In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision also      and considering the fact that the matter has

been settled between the parties and no public interest is

involved and as it is not a case of offence affecting the

society at large and in view of the settlement, the original

relationship has been restored between the parties             and no

purpose      will be     served by proceeding with the case as

conviction will be remote and it will be wastage of judicial

time, this Court feels that it is a fit case where power under

Section 482       of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote the

settlement and        restoration of     relationship    between the

parties and the pendency of this case will not be a hurdle for

the same.

      8.     So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings

Crl.M.C.No.1998 of 2014  : 7 :

in C.C.No.340/10 (Crime No.453/1988 of Pathanamthitta

police station) pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-II, Pathanamthitta as     against the

petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order  to the

concerned court immediately.

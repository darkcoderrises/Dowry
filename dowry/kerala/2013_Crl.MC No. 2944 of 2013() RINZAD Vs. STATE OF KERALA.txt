                     ----------------------------------------
                         Crl.M.C.No. 2944 of 2013
                     ----------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 18th day of July, 2013

                                  O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 5 in Crime No.61 of 2013 of

Kilimanoor Police Station, now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Attingal as C.P.No.26/2013 for the offences

punishable under Sections 109,120B,454,506(I),511 and 366 of I.P.C. with

a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR and Annexure 2 Final Report in Crime

No.61/2013 of Kilimanoor Police Station and all further proceedings

pursuant to the same including C.P.No.26/2013 on the file of the JFCM-II,

Attingal as the matter is settled out of court.

          2.  The allegation in the above case is that due to animosity of

the first accused towards the de facto complainant, for withdrawing from

the proposed marriage, after conducting ceremonies of engagement with

him, the accused with intention to abduct the de facto complainant

Crl.M.C.No.2944 of 2013

                                  :-2-:

conspired together and on 16.1.2013 while the de facto complainant was

waiting for college bus at Pappala junction at about 8.10 a.m. approached

her in a car bearing No.KL IBD 2903. When she escaped from the spot by

boarding a bus to her college, the accused followed the bus and thereafter

trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant and threatened her

mother to misuse the photographs of the de facto complainant and thereby

the petitioners have committed the offences punishable under Sections

109,120B,454,506(I),511 and 366 of I.P.C. and now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court with the second

respondent/the de facto complainant.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

second and third respondents.      I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

Crl.M.C.No.2944 of 2013

                                     :-3-:

of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the second and third respondents, who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondents submitted that

the above respondents, who are the de facto complainant and the mother of the

de facto complainant do not intend to proceed any further against the petitioners

and they have no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. Annexures 4 and 5 are the affidavits filed by respondents 2 and 3.

Besides that Annexure -3 is the compromise petition which is duly signed

by counsel for the petitioners and the respondents.          I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only Sections

109,120B,454,506(I),511 and 366 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

Crl.M.C.No.2944 of 2013

                                           :-4-:

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for the second and third respondents, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant has no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light

of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
           can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to
           quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically

Crl.M.C.No.2944 of 2013

                                          :-5-:

           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to

note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.                Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting

the relief as sought for.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure I FIR and

Annexure 2 Final Report in Crime No.61/2013 of Kilimanoor Police

Station and all further proceedings pursuant to the same including

C.P.No.26/2013 on the file of the JFCM-II, Attingal.

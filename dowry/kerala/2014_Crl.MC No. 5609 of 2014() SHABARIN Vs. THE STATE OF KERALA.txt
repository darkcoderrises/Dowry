                 ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
         =========================
                 Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014
       ============================
         Dated this the 07th day of October, 2014

                           ORDER


     The above Criminal Miscellaneous Case (Crl.M.C.) seeking

the invocation of the inherent powers conferred on this Court

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been

filed with the prayer to quash the impugned Annexure A1 final

report/charge sheet in Crime No.348 of 2009 of Binanipuram

Police Station, which has fled to the pendency of C.C No.995 of

2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

North Paravur and all further proceedings arising therefrom.

The petitioners are accused 1 to 7 in Crime No.348 of 2009 of

Binanipuram Police Station, Ernakulam district registered for

offences punishable under Sections 143, 148, 341, 323, 324

and 294(b) r/w Section 149 of Indian Penal Code.       The 2nd

respondent is the de facto complainant in this case.

     2. The gist of the allegations against the petitioners is

that on 28.07.2009 at about 4:45 p.m when the 2nd respondent

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014       2



reached near the school ground at Kadungalloor Padi, he saw

A1 and two other persons harassing respondents 4 and 5

herein and when he questioned the same, A1 pelted stone

against him and as a result he sustained injury on his right leg

and on seeing the same A4 rushed to the spot and assaulted

2nd respondent and thereupon the 3rd respondent and one

Dileep came to the rescue of 2nd respondent and thereupon A4

beaten 4th respondent in his forehead and kicked 3rd

respondent and when the people in that locality came to the

spot the accused ran away from the spot and when

respondents 2 to 4 proceeded to police station, petitioners 1,

3, 4 and 7 came in three motor cycles and attacked the 3rd

respondent with a helmet and assaulted and kicked the 2nd

respondent and Dileep and when people in the locality

gathered hearing the hue and cry, thy left the place. It is on

the basis of these allegations that the instant Crime No.348 of

2009 of Binanipuram Police Station was registered on

28.07.2009. After investigation, the police filed the impugned

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014           3



Annexure A1 final report/charge sheet in the aforementioned

crime and the case is now pending as C.C 995 of 2009 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, North Paravur.

It is stated that now the disputes between the petitioners and

respondents 2 to 5 have been settled out of court and that in

view of the settlement the respondents have no interest in

prosecuting the impugned criminal proceedings. It is further

submitted that during the pendency of the case, Dileep, who is

one of the witnesses, died as evident from Annexure A2 death

certificate dated 28.11.2012. It is stated that petitioners are

innocent of the allegations and that the entire disputes

between petitioners and respondents 2 to 5 have been settled

through      the      intervention of mediators    and   friends.

Respondents 2 to 5 have no more grievances against the

petitioners. Respondents 2 to 5 have filed separate affidavits

dated 14.09.2014, 16.09.2014, 16.09.2014 and 16.09.2014

before this Court in this Crl.M.C stating the aforementioned

facts further stating that since the entire disputes between the

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014           4



parties had been amicably settled there is no purpose in

proceeding with the impugned criminal proceedings and that

this Court may be pleased to quash the impugned Annexure A1

final report/charge sheet and the proceedings in C.C 995 of

2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

North Paravur in the interest of justice.           It is in the

background of these facts and circumstances             that the

aforementioned Crl.M.C has been filed.

      3.    The Crl.M.C. has been admitted and Sri.T.K.Nazar

has taken notice for the respondents 2 to 5 and the learned

Public Prosecutor has taken notice for the 1st respondent-State

of Kerala.

      4.    Heard      Sri.R.Krishnakumar, the  learned   counsel

appearing for the petitioners, Sri.T.K.Nazar, learned counsel

appearing for respondents 2 to 5 and          the learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Kearla.

      5.    The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted

that during the pendency of the aforementioned criminal

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014         5



proceedings, the matter has been settled amicably between

the parties, which is resulted in the subject matter of the

aforementioned crime/case and that the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case/crime will cause miscarriage of

justice to both parties as the real disputants to the case have

arrived at an amicable settlement and any further continuation

of the criminal proceedings will amount to sheer wastage of

time and money and would unnecessarily strain the financial,

administrative and financial resources of the State.

      6.    Sri.Sri.T.K.Nazar, the learned counsel appearing for

the respondents 2 to 5 has submitted on the basis of the

specific instructions furnished by the respondents 2 to 5 that

they have amicably settled the disputes with the petitioners

and that they have no objection in the quashment of         the

impugned           criminal  proceedings     and    that    the

complainant/victim/injured does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners as they have no grievance

against them and that they will not raise any dispute/compliant

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014        6



in future if the prayer for quashing the impugned final report is

allowed.

      7.    The learned Public Prosecutor also was heard, who

also has not raised any serious objections and submitted that

this court may consider the prayer in this case in the light of

the law well settled by the Apex Court in that regard.

      8.    After having carefully considered the submissions of

the parties and after having perused the pleadings as well as

the documents and materials placed in this matter, it can be

seen that the offences alleged are more or less personal in

nature and not much element of public interest is involved.

The crucial aspect of the matter is that though such offences

are involved, the real disputants to the controversy which has

led to the impugned criminal proceedings, have actually

arrived at an amicable settlement of the matter. From the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the respondents

2 to 5, it is clear to the court that the injured/victim/defacto

complainant         has no   further   grievance   against  the

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014               7



petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived at by

them. In this connection, it is relevant to note the decision of

the Apex Court in the case between Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160, para 61 = (2012)

10 SCC 303 = 2012(4) KLT 108(SC), wherein the Supreme

Court has held as follows in para 61 thereof [ See SCC (Cri)]:

                "61. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a
         criminal court for compounding the offences under
         S.320 of the Code.          Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
         exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
         such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
         to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.        In
         what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
         complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
         offender and victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
         and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
         footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences          arising       from        commercial,
         financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
         relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where
         the wrong is basically private or personal in nature

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014            8



         and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
         this category of cases, High Court may quash
         criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
         compromise between the offender and victim, the
         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
         continuation of criminal case would put accused to
         great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
         would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
         case despite     full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

      In the decision reported in the case Yogendra Yadav &

others v. The State of Jharkhand & another reported in

2014 (8) Scale 634 = III (2014) Current Criminal Reports CCR

426 (SC), the Apex Court has held as follows:

            "When the High Court is convinced that the offences are
      entirely personal in nature and, therefore, do not affect public
      peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such
      proceedings on account of compromise would bring about
      peace and would secure ends of justice, it should not hesitate
      to quash them".

      The Apex Court in the above case was dealing with a case

involving offences under Sections 341, 323, 324, 504 & 307

r/w Section 34 Indian Penal Code.

         9.    Considering the facts and circumstances of this

case, it is seen further that the impugned criminal proceedings

have arisen consequent to the personal disputes between the

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014        9



disputants and the disputes have been settled amicably

between the parties. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to hold

that in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived

at between the parties, the principles laid down in the

aforementioned decisions of the Apex Court will be squarely

applicable in the present case. Moreover, since the real

disputants to the controversy have amicably settled the

disputes, which led to these impugned criminal proceedings, it

is also the duty of the court to promote such settlement,

instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is also pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of

court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there may not

be any fruitful prosecution and the chances of conviction of the

accused is rather negligible and therefore, the net result of

continuance of criminal proceedings would be sheer waste of

judicial time rather meaningless and therefore would amount

to abuse of the process of court proceedings in the larger

Crl.M.C No.5609 of 2014            10



sense. Hence following decisions of the Apex Court cited supra,

this Court is inclined to hold that the Crl.M.C. can be allowed

by granting the prayers sought for.

         In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and the impugned

Annexure A1 final report/charge sheet in Crime No.348 of

2009 of Binanipuram Police Station which has led to the

pendency of C.C No.995 of 2009 on the file of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, North Paravur and all further

proceedings arising therefrom stand quashed. The petitioners

shall produce certified copies of this order before the court

below concerned as well as before the Station House Officer,

Binanipuram Police Station.

                     Crl.M.C.No.2763 Of 2015
           --------------------------------------------------
              DATED THIS THE 8th DAY OF MAY, 2015

                               ORDER

     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.213/2010 of Pandikkad

Police Station, which is now pending as C.C.No.5/2011 of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna. The learned

Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Sections 323, 324,

406 and 498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Now, it is

submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the entire disputes with

the second and third respondents have already been settled and

that now the first petitioner and the second respondent are residing

together along with their children.           The second and third

respondents have also sworn to a joint affidavit which is produced

along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A2. Therefore, the prayer in this

Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.5/2011 of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna.

     2.     Heard the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public

Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned

counsel for respondents 2 and 3.

Crl.M.C.No.2763/15          -2-


      3.     In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC

303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in

quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of

its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

given to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under

Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is

of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be

exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power

viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the

criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where

the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend

on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can

be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High

Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the

crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or

offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly

quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the

offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

Crl.M.C.No.2763/15         -3-


in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any

compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the

offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

or the offences committed by public servants while working in

that capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing

criminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases

having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on

a different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly

offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil

partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of

matrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where

the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the

parties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of

cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,

because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,

the possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and

continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and

Crl.M.C.No.2763/15           -4-


complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other

words, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or

contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

proceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would

tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and

compromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to

secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is

put to an end and if the answer to the above question is in

affirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to

quash the criminal proceedings.

      4.     The allegation against the petitioners is that they have

committed offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 406 and

498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

      5.     Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute

between the first petitioner and the second and third respondents

has already been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the

second and third respondents has also stated that the second

respondent does not want to prosecute the criminal case filed

against the petitioners. The second and third respondents have

Crl.M.C.No.2763/15          -5-


sworn to a joint affidavit before this Court as Annexure A2 in this

regard.     It is also submitted that the first petitioner and the

second respondent are now residing together along with their

children.

      6.     In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the

proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.5/2011 of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna can be

quashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid

down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire

proceedings in C.C.No.5/2011 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna arising out of Crime

No.213/2010 of Pandikkad Police Station against the petitioners

is quashed.

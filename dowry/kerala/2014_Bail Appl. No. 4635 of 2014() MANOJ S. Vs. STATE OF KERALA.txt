                    B.A. No. 4635 of 2014
           ------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 11th day of July, 2014


                          O R D E R

          Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.

309/2014 of Hemambika Nagar Police Station.            His wife

committed suicide on 22.05.2014.         It is alleged that she

committed suicide because the petitioner had used to

subject her to cruelty, both physical and mental demanding

more dowry and it was a case of dowry death.             3.

The petitioner's case is that she had incurred some debts

which she could not discharge and that was the reason for

her committing suicide.

     4.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   The victim committed suicide on 22.05.2014. In

the course of the preparation of the inquest report the Police

B.A. No. 4873 of 2014
                               -2-



recorded statements of the father of the victim and some

other witnesses. All of them have stated that the petitioner

used to assault the victim demanding more dowry and

unable to bear the cruelty of the petitioner, she often went

back to her parents' house. Under section 113B of Evidence

Act, there is a presumption against him. So, in my view,

this is not a fit case to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court

under section 438 Cr.P.C.

     In the result, this application is dismissed.

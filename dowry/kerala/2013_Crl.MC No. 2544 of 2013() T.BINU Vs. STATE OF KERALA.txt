                   Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
             ---------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 24th day of June, 2013

                               ORDER

     The above Crl.M.C. is filed by the second accused in

Crime No.219 of 2002 of Chathannoor Police Station, where

offences involved are under Sections 323, 324 & 308 read with

Section 34 of IPC and the present case of the petitioner is that

he could not face the trial, when the trial against the other

accused proceeded as he was out of station. According to the

petitioner, though the other accused on different occasions

faced the trial, in both the trial they were acquitted.

Therefore, there is no meaning in sending him to face the trial.

It is also the case of the petitioner that the de facto

complainant now came forward and settled the matter, which

is evident from affidavit sworn in by the de facto complainant.

Therefore, the petitioner seeks an order from this Court to

quash Annexure-A1 report and all further proceedings pending

against him.

Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
                            :-2-:


     2.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

     3.   The allegation against the petitioner is that, at about

3.30 p.m. on 01/07/2002 the accused three in number due to

previous enmity attacked the 4th respondent, who is the de

facto complainant with a sword, A2 with a stone and A3 with

his hand hit him and thereby caused contusions and

aberrations on the body of the de facto complainant and

thereby committed the above said offences.

     4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

as evident by Annexure-A2 judgment, the 3rd accused, who

faced the trial in S.C.No.252 of 2009, was acquitted by the

judgment dated 29/02/2012, as all the witnesses turned hostile

towards the prosecution.    It is also the submission of the

learned counsel for the petitioner that the first accused has

already been acquitted by judgment dated 05/06/2008 in

S.C.No.160 of 2004. Thus, the submission of the learned

counsel is that there would not be any fruitful turn out, if the

petitioner is compelled to face the trial especially when the

Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
                             :-3-:


matter is settled between the petitioner and the de facto

complainant, the 4th respondent herein who filed Annexure-A3

affidavit. The learned Public Prosecutor also fairly conceded

that, in view of Annexure-A2 judgment, it can be seen that the

learned Judge has also found that all the witnesses turned

hostile. The present case of the petitioner is that the matter

has been settled between himself and the de facto complainant

as evident by Annexure-A3 affidavit.

        5.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 323, 324 & 308 read

with Section 34 of IPC which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 4th respondent, it appears to me that the injured/the

victim/the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
                                       :-4-:


arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the

decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian

Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the

Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.    The position that emerges from the above

         discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the

         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

         complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

         and different from the power given to a criminal court for

         compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

         Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

         ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

         any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

         the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

         depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

         no category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
                                   :-5-:


        entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

        quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

        compromise between the offender and victim, the

        possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

        continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

        oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

        caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

        full and complete settlement and compromise with the

        victim........"


        According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that, since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

Crl.M.C.No.2544 of 2013
                             :-6-:


the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A-1 Final Report in Crime No.219 of 2002 of

Chathannoor Police Station and all further proceedings

thereto.

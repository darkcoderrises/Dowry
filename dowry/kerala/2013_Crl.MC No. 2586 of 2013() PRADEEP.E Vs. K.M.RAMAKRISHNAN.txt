                   ----------------------------------------
                      Crl.M.C.No. 2586 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R

                  The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are the accused in Crime No.1125 of 2010 of

Thalassery Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections

420,465 and 468 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure AII in

Crime No.1125 of 2010 of Thalassery Police Station as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that the complainant

and the first accused are co-owners of a property and the first accused

wanted the complainant to sell his share in the joint property to him,

but the complainant declined the request of the first accused. The

further allegation is that one Jaffer has filed a suit as O.S.No.535 of

2009 for specific performance of an agreement for sale, producing an

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                  :-2-:

agreement said to have been executed by which the complainant

agreed to sell his share to the said Jaffer and the attachment in the said

suit was lifted on payment of an amount of `5,21,370/-.               The

complainant further says that later one Sudhikanth has filed suit

O.S.No.54 of 2010 before the Munsiff Court, Thalassery for specific

performance producing an agreement said to have been executed by

the complainant agreeing to sell the undivided share of the

complainant to the said Sudhikanth.            Thus, according to the

complainant, the document is forged for the purpose of producing

before the court. Now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is

settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                 :-3-:

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above crime. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above crime is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the first respondent, who on the

basis of specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted

that the above respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and he has no

grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. Annexure AIII is the agreement entered into

between the parties and Annexure AIV is the affidavit sworn to by the

first respondent. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                      :-4-:

objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 420,465 and 468 of I.P.C., which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the first respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance

against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them.    In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                           :-5-:

          criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

          jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

          criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

          Code.      Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

          engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

          prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

          exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

          would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

          category can be prescribed..


It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

          dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

          purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

          etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

          this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                            :-6-:

         its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

         case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

         injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

         despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in

the present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in

the present case. Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial

time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.                              Thus,

Crl.M.C.No.2586 of 2013


                                 :-7-:

according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -

AII FIR in Crime No.1125 of 2010 of Thalassery Police Station and

all further proceedings thereto.

                   Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013
             ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 15th day of July, 2013

                           O R D E R

         The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.'), at the instance

of  the    petitioners, who    are   accused   Nos.1  &  2   in

C.C.No.134/2007 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

II, Ernakulam which is a case instituted upon the police report

[in Crime No. 19/2007 of the Cheranallur                 Police

Station] for the offences punishable under Sections 323, 324,

325 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash the

Annexure-A2 final report and all further proceeding in

C.C.No.134/2007 pending on the files of the Judicial

Magistrate of the First Class Court-II, Ernakulam as the matter

is settled out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the 2nd

petitioner is the husband of the de facto complainant who is

the third respondent herein and their marriage was solemnized

on 07.09.1997 in accordance with the Hindu religious rites and

while so, difference of opinion occurred among the spouse

especially when the de facto complainant was residing along

with the accused in the house of the 2nd petitioner which

Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013          2

resulted in filing various petitions before the police as well as

the various courts. According to the allegation in the above

case the petitioners/accused has committed the offences

punishable under Section 323, 324, 325 r/w Section 34 of IPC.

Now the case of the petitioners are that as part of settlement

all other matrimonial issues and the criminal case are also

settled between the petitioners and the de facto complainant.

Accordingly, the mutual divorce was obtained and they have

seperated for ever. Annexure-A4 is the judgment of the Family

Court, Ernakulam by which the marriage between the 2nd

petitioner and the de facto complainant is dissolved. Annexure-

A5 is the agreement arrived into between the petitioners and

de facto complainant.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the 3rd respondent.      I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013         3

process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the 3rd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

         7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 323, 324, 325 r/w Section

34 of I.P.C. which are more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though

such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute

approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the 3rd

Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013           4

respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is

relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108

(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-




                "57. The position that emerges from
         the above discussion can be summarised
         thus:      the power of the High Court in
         quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or
         complaint     in  exercise   of   its  inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the
         power      given  to   a  criminal   court   for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of
         the Code.       Inherent power is of wide
         plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
         has to be exercised in accord with the
         guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
         secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent
         abuse of the process of any Court. In what
         cases      power   to   quash    the    criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim
         have settled their dispute would depend on
         the facts and circumstances of each case
         and no category can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having
          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil

Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013          5

         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes      of  quashing, particularly the
         offences arising from commercial, financial,
         mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
         family disputes where the wrong is basically
         private or personal in nature and the
         parties have resolved their entire dispute.
         In this category of cases, High Court may
         quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the
         offender and victim, the possibility of
         conviction      is remote   and   bleak  and
         continuation of criminal case would put
         accused to great oppression and prejudice
         and extreme injustice would be caused to
         him by not quashing the criminal case
         despite     full and complete settlement and
         compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the

above decision is applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it

is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the

dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled

out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction

Crl.M.C.No.2875 of 2013       6

of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure -A2 and all further proceedings pending against the

petitioners in C.C.No. 134 of 2007 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam.

               Dated this the 19th day of June, 2013

                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners         are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.801/2013 of Koratty Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 read with

Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. Apart

from the usual allegations in a case like this, no specific

overt acts are alleged against any of the petitioners. On

going through the contents of the CD, I do not think that the

BA.3736/2013
                                : 2 :



custodial interrogation of the petitioners is required for the

continued investigation of this case. Being a matrimonial

offence, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on

each of them executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty

five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)  The petitioners shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

      a.m.    on   all  Wednesdays       and    Saturdays,

      commencing from 26-06-2013 for a period of

      three months or till the filing of the final report in

      this case, whichever is earlier.


            (ii) The petitioners shall not tamper with

      the evidence or influence witnesses.

BA.3736/2013
                                : 3 :



            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

     available for interrogation as and when required

     by the investigating officer.


            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

           -------------------------------------------------
                    B.A. No. 5995 OF 2007
           -------------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 8th day of October, 2007

                              ORDER



     Application for anticipatory bail. The petitioners are the

husband of the de facto complainant, his brother and mother-

in-law.   The marriage took place on 14/6/07.             The de facto

complainant was allegedly vexed with demands for dowry.

Physical cruelty of culpable variety was also allegedly inflicted

on her. The First Information Statement was recorded on the

basis of a complaint recorded from the de facto complainant

who was in the hospital at the relevant time.          Investigation is

in progress. The petitioners apprehend imminent arrest.

     2. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that

the petitioners are absolutely innocent. There is problem of

mal adjustments     in marriage for the newly wedded wife.

Fanciful and exaggerated allegations are being raised against

B.A. No. 5995 OF 2007           -: 2 :-

the petitioners because of such strain in the matrimony. The de

facto complainant has not suffered any injury.           In these

circumstances, anticipatory bail may be granted to the

petitioners, it is prayed.

      3.  The learned Public Prosecutor does not oppose the

application. The      learned  Public   Prosecutor submits that

appropriate conditions may be imposed in the interests of a fair,

efficient and expeditious investigation.     The learned Public

Prosecutor points out that the victim has suffered no external

injury indicative of the alleged physical cruelty meted out to her.

      4. I reckon the stand taken by the learned Public

Prosecutor to be fair and reasonable.     Arrest and incarceration

of the petitioners is likely to mar the matrimonial tie beyond

repair.  I am satisfied that, subject to appropriate conditions to

be imposed in the interests of a fair, efficient and expeditious

investigation, the petitioners can be granted anticipatory bail.

      5. In the result, this petition is allowed.       Following

directions are issued under Sec.438 of the Cr.P. C.:

      (i) The petitioners shall appear before the learned

B.A. No. 5995 OF 2007           -: 3 :-

shall be released on regular bail on their executing bonds for

Rs.25,000/- each with two solvent sureties each for the like sum

to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.

      (ii) The petitioners shall make themselves available for

interrogation before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m.

      (iii)  If the petitioners do not appear before the learned

thereafter stand revoked and the police shall be at liberty to

arrest the petitioners and deal with them in accordance with law

as if these directions were not issued at all;

      (iv) If the petitioners were arrested prior to their surrender

on 15/10/07 as directed in clause (i) above,         they shall be

released on their executing bonds for Rs.25,000/- each without

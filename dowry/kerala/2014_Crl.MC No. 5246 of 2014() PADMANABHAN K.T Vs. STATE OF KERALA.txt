                            V.K.MOHANAN, J
                    ===========================
                         Crl.M.C No.5246 of 2014
                   ============================
                Dated this the 22nd day of September, 2014

                                  ORDER


      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners, who

are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.565/2012 of Vattiyoorkavu

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 308 and 34

of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I FIR in Crime No. 565/2012 of

Vattiyoorkavu Police Station as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.    The allegation in the above case is that the 1st petitioner

married the 2nd respondent on 23.11.2011 as per the rites and customs

prevailing in their community and they lived together as husband and wife

in the matrimonial home. At the time of marriage the parents of the 2nd

respondent presented 51 sovereigns of gold ornaments as dowry, which

were forcefully taken from the custody of 2nd respondent and kept in the

custody of 2nd petitioner. Thereafter, the accused together started to harass

the 2nd respondent both physically and mentally for more dowry and thus,

they have committed the aforesaid offences and now, the case of the

Crl.M.C No.5246 of 2014
                                       2

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the 2nd

respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during the

pendency of the above crime, the matter is settled amicably between the parties

to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above crime. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above crime is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received    from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

Crl.M.C No.5246 of 2014
                                              3

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case, it

can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are under Sections

498A, 308 and 34 of Indian Penal Code, which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that though such

offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex

Court, in the decision reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita

Raghuvanshi and another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                  "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on
          considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints
          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but
          also against the relatives of the husband.     The question is when such
          matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
          home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both the
          sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of the
          criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under Sections
          498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on the sole
          ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of
          the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash the criminal
          proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the
          filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and
          Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and
          intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties
          concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a
          compromise/settlement.    Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

Crl.M.C No.5246 of 2014
                                               4

          compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on
          record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants herein.
          It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement arrived
          at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit stating that
          she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against the appellants
          and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It is the grievance
          of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected such prayer of the
          parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its jurisdiction under
          Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the criminal proceedings
          relate to the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC
          which are non-compoundable in nature."
                   "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage genuine
          settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same are on
          considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if they
          relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is satisfied that the parties
          have settled the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold that for
          the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code would not
          be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or the
          subsequent criminal proceedings.
                       13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in
          recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place and
          it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
          should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to
          settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their
          defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement
          instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice
          in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in exercising
          its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power under
          Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
          when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that
          allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of
          the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to
          be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A of I.P.C.

The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated from the matrimonial

issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the

criminal case as well.

Crl.M.C No.5246 of 2014
                                       5

          According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in

the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable in the

present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I FIR and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime No.

565/2012 of the Vattiyoorkavu Police Station.

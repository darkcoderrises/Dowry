            =======================
           Dated this the 12th day of February, 2015

                           O R D E R




     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1653 of 2013 of the

Vatakara Police Station registered for the offences punishable

under Sections 406 and 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code.

     2.   Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FlR and Annexure

A2 Final Report     in Crime No.1653 of 2013 of the Vatakara

Police Station and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.657 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Vatakara, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the

wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the

meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

Crl.M.C. No. 655 of 2015
                                 2

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioners and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints     against  the  petitioners     and,  therefore,    the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7. When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

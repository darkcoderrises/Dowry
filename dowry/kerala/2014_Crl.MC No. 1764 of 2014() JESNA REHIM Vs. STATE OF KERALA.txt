                        CRL. M.C. No.1764 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 2nd day of September, 2014


                                     O R D E R




          This criminal miscellaneous case was filed by the

petitioner, who is the defacto-complainant in Crime

No.73/2014 of Kunnathunadu police station, challenging the

order granting of anticipatory bail by the Sessions court in

Crl.M.C.No.272/2014 to the 2nd respondent under Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called

'the Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the wife of the 2nd respondent. After marriage,

both of them resided abroad. The allegation was that while

she was residing with him there, in abroad, 2nd respondent

started harassing her, demanding more money and property

towards dowry. He used to manhandle her so brutally and

inhumanly regularly and continuously. He had illicit

relationship with another woman.                            In the wedlock two

children were born to them. In August 2013, the 2nd

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                                2

respondent sent her back to India and she came back to

India and filed a complaint before the Ambalamedu police

against the 2nd respondent and no action was taken by the

police. So she filed a private complaint before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherrry, against the 2nd

respondent and his relatives, alleging offences under

Section 323, 341, 342, 506(1), 403, 407, 420 and 498A read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.         The learned

magistrate forwarded the complaint for investigation and

crime No.73/2014 of Kunnathunadeu police station was

registered. In the meantime, 2nd             respondent filed

Crl.M.C.No.272/2014        before    the    Sessions    Court,

Ernakulam, for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the

Code and the same was granted by the Sessions Judge,

without safeguarding or securing his availability during

investigation and trial.     He is now trying to migrate to

Canada and he will not be available for trial. So according

to the petitioner, Annexure-A4 order granting anticipatory

bail is illegal and the petitioner has no other remedy, except

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                                     3

to approach this court, seeking the following relief:

            i. To call for the records leading to Annexure-A3
      order and quash the same by invoking Section 482 of
      Cr.P.C. in the interest of justice.
            ii. To direct the 1st respondent to take all the
      measures to ensure the presence of the 2nd respondent by
      his arrest immediately, and during investigation and trial.
            iii. To pass any other order or direction as this
      Hon'ble Court may deem fit and necessary in the facts
      and circumstances of the case.

            3.    2nd respondent appeared and filed detailed

counter, traversing the allegations made and also stated the

reason for the complaint being filed by the petitioner, which

I do not think it is necessary to be considered for the

purpose of disposal of this application. However, the case

of the 2nd       respondent was that, he has been falsely

implicated in the case and the attempt of the petitioner is

only to bring him here and deny his employment abroad and

to harass him. Further, no illegality has been committed by

the court below in granting the relief and he prayed for

dismissal of the application.

            4.    Heard, the learned counsel for the petitioner,

learned Public Prosecutor and the counsel appearing for the

2nd respondent.

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                                4

            5.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioner submitted that, grievance of the petitioner is that,

no safeguards have been provided in the order granting

anticipatory bail to secure the presence of the accused for

the purpose of investigation and trial. Further under

Section 438 of the Code, court should have not grant

anticipatory bail, without imposing condition making his

presence available for interrogation and later for the

purpose of trial.      It should have been provided for the

purpose of procuring the presence of the accused for the

purpose of investigation as well as for the purpose of trial of

the case, which has not been done. Further under Section

438 of the Code, court can impose condition, not to leave

India but such a condition has not been imposed in this

case. Further even after the application is filed, he has

come to India, but he had not co-operated with the

investigation. So according to him, the only grievance is

that, even if the final report is filed, he wants for the

presence of the accused to be secured and allowed to

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                                 5

proceed with the trial and avoid delay in disposal of the

case.

            6.    The learned Public Prosecutor submitted

that, in this case investigation is completed and final report

filed and it was taken on file as C.C.1093/2014 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. The

counsel for the 2nd respondent also submitted that, the

petitioner has moved the Sessions Court for modification of

the conditions and later it was allowed to be dismissed as

not pressed.

            7.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioner submitted that, since he felt that the modification

petition cannot be filed by the defacto-complainant and he

can only challenge the order passed by the Sessions Court,

granting anticipatory bail, the application was not pressed

and accordingly the petition was dismissed as not pressed

and that cannot be a bar for considering this application.

            8.    It is an admitted fact that, such unfortunate

incidents are happening in India now and filing of such

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                              6

complaint are increasing nowadays. There was a marriage

between two youngsters and they lived for some time

abroad and thereafter the love lost between them and that

resulted in filing the complaint, after the wife came back to

India against the husband and his relatives, alleging

offences under Section 342, 498A, 323, 341, 506(1), 403,

407 and 420 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code,

by way of a private complaint, which was forwarded to the

police by the learned magistrate for investigation under

Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on the

basis of which the present crime No.73/2014 was registered

by the Kunnathunadu police. It is also an admitted fact

that, the entire incident of alleged cruelty had happened,

when they were residing together in Dubai. I am not at this

stage going to the question, as to whether any offence

committed abroad can be prosecuted here, as Section 188

of the Code only says that, it is not a bar for registering a

crime and conducting investigation but only for the trial of

the case later without the sanction of the Central

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                                    7

Government. However it is also an admitted fact that, the

2nd respondent filed an application for anticipatory bail as

Crl.M.C.No.272/2014           before      the      Sessions       Court,

Ernakulam, and the learned Sessions Judge by Annexure-A3

order granted anticipatory bail on following conditions.

            "1. In the even of arrest of the petitioner, he shall
      be released on bail on execution of bond for 25,000/-
      each along with two solvent sureties for the like sum to
      the satisfaction of the investigating officer, or the officer
      who enforces the arrest.
            2.  The    petitioner   shall  appear     before    the
      investigating officer, as and when required.
            3.    While on bail, the petitioner shall not involve
      in any similar offence.
            4.    The petitioner shall not, in any way, interfere
      with the investigation process".

            9.    Section 438 of the Code only says that, in the

event of arrest, a direction has to be given to the

investigating officer or arresting officer to release the

accused on certain conditions and Section 438 also says

that,    court   may     impose      conditions, which          includes

preventing      the    accused      going    abroad      without     the

permission of the court, so as to enable his presence for the

purpose of co-operation with the investigating officer to

complete the investigation in a smooth manner, but it is not

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                              8

always mandatory. Further in this case, the court below

has    directed   the  petitioner  to    appear   before   the

investigating officer as and when required. Though in the

counter statement filed by them in another writ petition as

W.P.(C).No.9139/2014, the investigation officer has stated

that, they could not arrest the petitioner, as he was not

available. They have no case that, they have issued any

notice under Section 41A or 160 of the Code, for the

purpose of getting the presence of the 2nd respondent,

either for the purpose of interrogation or in connection with

the investigation. So under such circumstances, it cannot be

said that the 2nd respondent was not at fault, in not co-

operating with the investigation as contended by the

counsel for the petitioner. However, since the investigation

of this case has already been completed, final report has

been filed and case has been taken on file as C.C.1093/2014

on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Kolencherry, this court feels that, it is not necessary at this

stage to interfere with the order of anticipatory bail granted

Crl.M.C. 1764/2014
                               9

by the Sessions Judge. But if the summons is issued to the

2nd respondent and the 2nd respondent did not appear before

the trial court, then the magistrate is at liberty to take all

steps to get his presence procured in accordance with law

and when he applies for bail, that court also can consider all

those aspects to impose necessary conditions, if any

required for the purpose of disposing the bail application.

The disposal of the petition will not affect the right of both

the 2nd respondent and the petitioner in pursuing the

remedy of quashing final report or filing of further private

complaint, if the outcome of the investigation is not satisfied

by the petitioner in accordance with law.

            With the above direction and observation, the

criminal miscellaneous case is disposed of.

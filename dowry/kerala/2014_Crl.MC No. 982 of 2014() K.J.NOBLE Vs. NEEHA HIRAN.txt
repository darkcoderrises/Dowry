           Dated this the 3rd day of February, 2014


                                   O R D E R



          This Criminal Miscellaneous case is filed by the

accused in C.C.No.5095/2013 on the file of the Judicial 1st

Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakkuda, to quash the

proceedings, after recording the composition entered into

between the petitioners and the defacto-complainant,

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

(hereinafter called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that the

petitioners are accused in C.C.5095/2013 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakkuda,

alleging offence under Section 498(A), 406, 312 and 313

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.                                     It was

originated on the basis of a complaint given by the 2nd

respondent as Annexure-1 by the first respondent before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakkuda,

which was forwarded to the police for investigation by

Crl.M.C. No.982 of 2014
                               2

the learned magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code.

On receipt of the same, the concerned police registered a

case as Crime No.905/2013 under Section 498(A), 406,

312 and 313 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code

against the petitioners and after investigation the 2nd

respondent filed final report before that court for the

above said offences and the learned magistrate has taken

cognizance of the case as C.C.5095/2013. Now the matter

has been settled between the parties, due to the

intervention of the well-wishers and a compounding

application has been filed before this court as Criminal

M.A.No.1317/2014. The first respondent also has filed an

affidavit stating that the matter has been settled between

the parties. No purpose will be served by proceeding the

case, so they prayed for quashing the proceedings

invoking the power under Section 482 of the Code.

Hence the petition.

            3.     The first respondent appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled

between the parities, and she has no objection in

Crl.M.C. No.982 of 2014
                               3

quashing the proceedings as the matter has been settled

between the parties.

            4.     Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also

who opposed the application.

            5.     It is an admitted fact that the first

petitioner married the first respondent and they lived

together for sometime as husband and wife and

thereafter due to some mis-understanding between them,

they started residing separately and several litigations

have been filed at the instance of the first respondent

before the family court and also initiation of prosecution,

which resulted in C.C.5095/2013 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Irinjalakkuda. Due

to the intervention of family members and well-wishers,

the matters have been settled between the parities on the

terms mentioned in Criminal M.A.No.1317/2014. Most of

the offences alleged are non-compoundable in nature.

But it is an admitted fact that, it is really a family dispute,

which     resulted     in the   litigations   including    this

proceedings. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in the

Crl.M.C. No.982 of 2014
                                  4

decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], that compounding of offences

under Section 320 and quashing of criminal proceedings

under Section 482 are different and distinct. High Court

must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to

the interest of justice to continue with such proceedings

in view of the settlement and compromise to each.

Further in the same decision, it has been observed as

follows:

            "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
      for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
      arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,
      partnership or such like transactions or the offences
      arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
      family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may
      quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
      compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
      full and complete settlement and compromise with the
      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of
      justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or
      continuation    of  the    criminal  proceedings   would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
      and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
      whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
      that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to
      the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court

Crl.M.C. No.982 of 2014
                                   5

      shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
      proceeding."

            6.     This is a family dispute. It is true that the

offence under Section 312 and 313 of Indian Penal Code

also incorporated, which is of little grave nature. But

considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and there is no possibility of the

defacto-complainant,        supporting       the   case     of   the

prosecution, even if the case is sent for trial, I feel that no

purpose will be served by allowing the continuation of the

proceedings in court. Further, since the parties to the lis

have already decided to live separately and being a family

dispute settled due to the intervention of family members

and    well-wishers,      this   court     has   to   honour     the

compromise and allow them to live harmoniously on the

basis of the settlement. So I feel that it is a fit case where

the power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings. So the application is

allowed and the proceedings in C.C.No.1595/2013 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Irinjalakkuda (Crime No.905/2013 of Kodakara Police

directed to communicate this order to the concerned

court, immediately.

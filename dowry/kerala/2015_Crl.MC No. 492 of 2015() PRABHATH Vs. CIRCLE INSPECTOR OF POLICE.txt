               ===================
                CRL.M.C. No.492 of 2015
               ====================
           Dated this the 18th day of February, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.481 of 2014 of the

Alappuzha North Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 First Information

Report in Crime No.481 of 2014 of the Alappuzha North

Police Station and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.97 of 2014 pending before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate's Court, Alappuzha, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.492 of 2015
                             -: 2 :-



the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 4th

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The     defacto complainant,   who    is  the     4th

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.492 of 2015
                                   -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.                The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

First Information Report in Crime No.481 of 2014 of the

Alappuzha North Police Station and all further proceedings

based on it, in C.C.No.97 of 2014 pending before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Alappuzha, are hereby quashed.

                   ================
                   Crl.M.C. No. 7030 of 2014
             =======================
             Dated this the 4th day of March, 2015

                          O R D E R




      Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.929/14 of the

Kondotty Police Station, Malappuram registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 406, 324 and 498A read with Section

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A FIR in Crime

No.929/14 of the Kondotty Police Station, Malappuram and all

further proceedings against the petitioner in the said crime

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Malappuram, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he has

tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is the wife

of the petitioner, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

Crl.M.C. No. 7030 of 2014
                                 2

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned

counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in dispute

between the petitioner and the defacto complainant have been

amicably settled and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings

against the petitioner may be quashed.

      6.     The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioner have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaint against the

petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.               She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit has

been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been settled

Crl.M.C. No. 7030 of 2014
                                   3

between the parties and as the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and expedient in

the interest of justice to quash the proceedings referred to

above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A FIR in

Crime No.929/14 of the Kondotty Police Station, Malappuram

and all further proceedings against the petitioner in the said

crime pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,

Malappuram, are hereby quashed.

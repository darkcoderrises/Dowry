Balakrishnan Nair, J.

      The petitioner has approached this Court apprehending

threat to his life from the part of the 2nd respondent, who is his

son-in-law. Demanding dowry, the 2nd respondent came to his

house on 15.2.2008 and tried to beat and manhandle him and

his wife. They were abused using filthy language. Though the

petitioner moved the Sub Inspector of Police, pointing out the

above illegal action, by filing Ext.P1 representation on

16.2.2008, no action was taken.           Therefore, he filed Ext.P2

representation before the           Circle Inspector of Police on

25.2.2008. The same was also of no avail. Hence, this writ

petition, seeking a direction to the police to grant protection to

his life.



      2.   The learned Government Pleader, upon instructions,

submitted that the 2nd respondent was summoned to the police

station and strictly warned, not to create any problem to the

W.P.(C) No.8362/2008              2


petitioner. The police also told the petitioner that in case there

is any problem from the part of the 2nd respondent, he can move

the police. In that event, the police will take necessary action to

protect him.



      In view of the above submission of the learned Government

Pleader, this writ petition is closed.

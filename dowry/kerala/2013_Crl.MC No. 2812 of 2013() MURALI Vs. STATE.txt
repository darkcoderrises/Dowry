                  Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
              -------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 09th day of July, 2013

                              ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the petitioner, who is the accused in C.P.No.11 of 2013 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, North Parur

which is a case instituted upon the police report in Crime

No.1106 of 2011 of North Parur Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 294(b) & 506(1) of I.P.C.

and Section 3(1)(x) of Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 with a prayer to quash all

proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.P.No.11 of

2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

North Parur, as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.    The prosecution allegation is that on 11/07/2011 at

about 5.30 p.m., the accused had caught hold of the second

respondent by his shirt, who is the de facto complainant, a

member     of   categorized      Scheduled       Caste   Community

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                             :-2-:


wrongfully restraining him with the intention to harass by

calling his caste name, uttering abusive words, slapped on the

left cheek and thereby causing pain to the 2nd respondent and

thus criminally intimidated him with serious consequences,

defamed and thereby the petitioner/accused has committed

the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 506

(1) of IPC read with Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Prevention of

Atrocities Act, 1989. On the basis of the above allegation,

Crime No.1106 of 2011 was registered in the North Parur

Police   Station    and  when     the  police  completed   the

investigation, they filed a report based upon which C.P.No.11

of 2013 was instituted in the court of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, North Parur. Now the case of the petitioner

as well as the second respondent/de facto complainant is that,

even during the stage of investigation itself the de facto

complainant informed the police that he has no complaint

against the petitioner as per Annexure-A2. According to the

de facto complainant, he was informed by the Deputy

Superintendent of Police, Aluva that his complaint was false.

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                           :-3-:


Now the grievance of the petitioner is that, after the above

development, the police now preferred a report against the

petitioner. According to the petitioner as well as the second

respondent/de facto complainant, the matter is settled out of

court.     Annexure-A5   is  the   affidavit of    the second

respondent/de facto complainant. Since the entire incident

originated in connection with the labour dispute and the

matter is settled, nobody is interested to proceed with the

criminal case.

        3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well

as the 2nd respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

        4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that, during the pendency of the above case, the dispute is

settled amicably between the parties which is the subject

matter of the above case. Therefore, the continuation of the

proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                              :-4-:


        5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioner and he has no grievance against him.

        6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of

the respective counsel.    I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition including

Annexure-A5 affidavit. In the given facts and circumstances of

the case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

        7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323, 294(b) &

506(1) of I.P.C. and Section 3(1)(x) of Scheduled Castes &

Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                                    :-5-:


involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court

after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission

made by the counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me

that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against

the petitioner/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by

them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)] in which the Supreme Court

has held as follows:-

              "57.   The position that emerges from the above

        discussion can be summarised thus:        the power of the

        High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or

        complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct

        and different from the power given to a criminal court for

        compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.

        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

        guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the

        ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

        any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal

        proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where

        the offender and victim have settled their dispute would

        depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and

        no category can be prescribed..

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                                       :-6-:


It is further held as follows:-

         "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and

         pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing

         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

         arising from commercial, financial,mercandile, civil,

         partnership or such like transactions or the offences

         arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the

         family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

         personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

         entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may

         quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the

         compromise between the offender and victim, the

         possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

         continuation of criminal case would put accused to great

         oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be

         caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

         full and complete settlement and compromise with the

         victim........"


         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the parties

to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since the

Crl.M.C.No.2812 of 2013
                             :-7-:


matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with

the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result

would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following

the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

        In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A1 FIR and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioner in C.P.No.11 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, North Parur.

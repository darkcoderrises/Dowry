                      K.RAMAKRISHNAN, J.
                   =================
                  CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014
               =====================
               Dated this the 9th day of June, 2014

                              ORDER
                              --------

      This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos.1 to 4 in CC.No.1969 of 2010 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kottarakkara to

quash the proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section

482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (herein after called the

Code).

      2.     It is alleged in the petition that petitioners and

respondents 2 to 4 were students of Travancore Engineering

College, Kollam and on account of some difference opinion

between them, there was some incident happened and the first

respondent herein filed a private complaint before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kottarakkara against the

petitioners alleging commission of offences under Section 341,

323 and 324 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code which

was forwarded to the police for investigation by the learned

Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure

Code. On receipt of the above complaint, a case was registered

as Crime No.607 of 2009 of Pooyappaly police station and after

investigation Annexure-A1 final report was filed which was taken

on file as CC.No.1969 of 2010 and it is now pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kottarakkara. In the

CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014              2

meantime, the matter has been settled between the parties due to

the intervention of family members and well wishers of both parties.

Respondents 1 to 3 who are the defacto complainant and injured in

the case do not want to prosecute the petitioners any longer on

account of the settlement. No purpose will be served by continuing

the case as well in view of the settlement. Since some of the

offences are non compoundable in nature, they could not file the

application before the Court below for record compounding.             So,

they have no other remedy except to approach this Court seeking

the following relief:-

      to quash the entire proceedings initiated against the petitioner,

      in CC.No.1969 of 2010 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

      No-II, Kottarakkara, in the interest of justice.

      3.     Respondents 1 to 3 appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

they do not want to prosecute the petitioners any longer in view of

the settlement and their relationship has been restored on account

of the settlement and they have now filed Annexure-A5 to A7

affidavits stating these facts.

      4.     The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by proceeding

with the case and no conviction will be possible as well. So he

prayed for allowing the application.

CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014            3

       5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case against

the petitioners but opposed the application.

       6.   It is an admitted fact that the petitioners and the

respondents 1 to 3 were students in the Travancore Engineering

College, Kollam at the time when the incident happened. It is also

an admitted fact that the incident happened in connection with the

election conducted in the College. It is also an admitted fact that the

case was registered on the basis of a private complaint which was

forwarded to the police and after investigation Annexure-A1 final

report was filed and it is now pending as CC.No.1969 of 2010 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kottarakkara.

Now the matter has been settled between the parties. Since there

was some defect in the earlier Annexure II to IV affidavits that was

corrected and fresh Annexure -A5 to A7 affidavits were filed, in

which the defacto complainant and other injured persons have

stated that the matter has been settled between the parties and

they do not have any further grievance against the petitioners and

on account of the settlement, their old relationship has been

restored. On account of the settlement there is no possibility of

conviction also as neither the defacto complainant nor the witnesses

will support the case of the prosecution. Further the incident

happened during their college days when, they were motivated by

CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014               4

some political parties and under the influence of the political

ideologies which they were not really understood at that time and

now they have realized their fault and they want to rectify

themselves and lead a happy life. Further, it cannot be said to be a

matter of public interest as well as a private dispute between the

parties has been entered in registration of the crime and filing of the

final report which has now been settled due to the intervention of

well wishers of both parties and they have decided to forget and

forgive and to have a good relationship in future.

      7.    In the decision in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab

reported in 2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC). The Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held as follows:

           "The position that emerges from the above discussion can

     be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing

     in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its

     inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power

     given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under

     S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no

     statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the

     guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of

     justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In

     what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or

     complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and

     victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and

     circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.

     However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must

     have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.

     Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences

CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014               5

    like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed

    even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have

    settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature

    and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise

    between the victim and offender in relation to the offences

    under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the

    offences committed by public servants while working in that

    capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal

    proceedings involving such offences.       But the criminal cases

    having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand

    on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly

    the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,

    civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences

    arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family

    disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in

    nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

    this category of case, High Court may quash criminal

    proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between

    the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

    and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused

    to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would

    be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full

    and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In

    other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be

    unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

    the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal

    proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law

    despite settlement and compromise between the victim and

    wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

    appropriate that criminal case is put to end and if the answer

    to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall

    be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

CRL.M.C.NO.2828 OF 2014             6

      8.    In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties as it happened during their college days without

knowing the consequences and now they have realized their

mistakes and want to rectify themselves and settlement has

restored their old relationship and conviction in such case is remote,

this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power under Section

482 of Criminal Procedure Code has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings in order to promote the settlement and restoration of

relationship between the parties.

      So the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

CC.No.1969 of 2010 (Crime No.607 of 2009 of Pooyappaly police

station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-

II, Kottarakkara as against the petitioners is quashed.

      With the above directions and observations this application is

disposed of.

      The Office is directed to communicate this order to the concerned

Court immediately for further necessary action in this regard.

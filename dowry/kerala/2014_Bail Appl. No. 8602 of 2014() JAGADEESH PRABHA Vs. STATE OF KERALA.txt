                    ====================
                     B.A. No.8602 of 2014
                   =====================
           Dated this the 18th day of December, 2014

                           O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1806 of 2014

of the Anchal Police Station, registered for the offences

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st petitioner and treated her with cruelty by

demanding     more    dowry     and   gold  ornaments,   after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned Senior Public Prosecutor.

     5.    The investigation of this case is practically over.

B.A. No.8602 of 2014                2

No criminal antecedents have been reported against the

petitioners. This is not a case, wherein the custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is required for the continued

investigation of this case. Being a matrimonial offence and

considering the chance of re-union and the possibility of

settlement in the matter, I am of the view that this is a fit case

wherein anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to enlarge

the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on each of

them executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand

only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to the

following terms and conditions:-

           (i)    The petitioners shall report before the

     investigating officer in between 09.00 a.m. and

     11.00    a.m.   on     all Mondays      and    Thursdays

     commencing from 22.12.2014 for a period of three

     months or till the filing of the final report in this case,

B.A. No.8602 of 2014              3

     whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.



      It is made clear that the violation of any of the conditions

stipulated above will result in the cancellation of bail.

                 ===================
                 CRL.M.C. No.1060 of 2015
               ====================
            Dated this the 5th day of March, 2015

                          O R D E R


     Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1209 of 2014 of

the Ottapalam Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A First Information

Report in Crime No.1209 of 2014 of the Ottapalam Police

Station and all further proceedings based on it, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 6th petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

CRL.M.C.No.1060 of 2015
                             -: 2 :-



      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

CRL.M.C.No.1060 of 2015
                               -: 3 :-



complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A

First Information Report in Crime No.1209 of 2014 of the

Ottapalam Police Station and all further proceedings based

on it, are hereby quashed.

                      R.P.(F.C.)No.1 OF 2006
                     --------------------------------
         Dated this the 19th day of November, 2012

                              O R D E R
                             ~~~~~~~


      Revision    petitioner     is   the    counter  petitioner in

M.C.No.216/2005 on the file of the Family Court, Manjeri, a

petition filed by the respondent herein under Section 125 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure seeking an order directing the

revision petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.3,000/- as maintenance to

the respondent.



      2.    It is alleged that the revision petitioner married the

respondent on 7.6.2002 in accordance with the customary rites

and they lived together as husband and wife for 25 days.

Thereafter, the revision petitioner went abroad.         There was

persistent demand for more dowry and that the revision

petitioner was deserted and failed to provide maintenance.



      3.    The revision petitioner in his counter statement

contended that revision petitioner divorced the respondent by

pronouncing thalaq on 21.9.2004 and it is incorrect to say that

R.P.F.C.No.1/2006               2


the revision petitioner was working abroad and that he is

without any job or income and is not liable or able to pay

maintenance to the respondent.



      4.     With the above pleadings, the parties were sent for

enquiry.     The respondent was examined as PW1.          Revision

petitioner and another were examined as RWs 1 and 2. Exts.P1

and D1 were marked. On appraisal of the materials on record,

Family court arrived at a finding that there is no proof of talaq

and that there is failure on the side of the revision petitioner to

provide maintenance to the respondent. The Family court found

that though the revision petitioner was having no regular

avocation, he was found engaged in driving a jeep. On that basis,

the Family court arrived at a conclusion that the revision

petitioner would be able to earn at least Rs.75 per day. On that

assumption, the revision petitioner was directed by the

impugned order to pay maintenance to the respondent at the

rate of Rs.800/- per month. Assailing the legality, correctness

and propriety of the above order, this Revision Petition is

preferred.

R.P.F.C.No.1/2006                3


      5.     I have heard Adv. Sri.R.Renjith, the learned counsel

appearing for the revision petitioner, who took me through the

the order impugned as well as the relevant evidence on record.

None represented the respondent.



      6.     Respondent is the legally wedded wife of the revision

petitioner.     It is admitted.   Though it is pleaded that he

respondent was divorced by pronouncing thalaq, there is no

proof. On the alleged date of pronouncing thalaq, the revision

petitioner was employed abroad. There is nothing on record to

come to a conclusion that the revision petitioner complied with

the procedures mandated by the law before pronouncing thalaq

or that the pronouncement of the thalaq was in the presence of

any witness or that it was communicated to the respondent.

Ext.D1 was produced as if it is a copy of the communication sent

to the respondent. RW2 was examined in support of the so

called pronouncement of thalaq. But RW1 would depose that he

has no direct knowledge.       His case is that a communication

was received in the mosque from the revision petitioner

regarding the thalaq and the copy of the communication was

R.P.F.C.No.1/2006               4


entrusted to a shop owner near the house of the respondent.

There is no case that the same was communicated to the

respondent.      In the above circumstance, court below was

justified in concluding that there is no         thalaq and the

respondent is still the wife of the revision petitioner. There is

also no case that the revision petitioner had paid any

maintenance during the iddath period or any fair and reasonable

provision for the respondent in case there was a divorce. There

is nothing on record to conclude that the respondent has any

means for her maintenance. Therefore, she is entitled to an

order for separate maintenance.



      7.     Regarding the quantum, I find that the amount

awarded is not at all exorbitant. Amount now awarded is less

than Rs.27/- per day. It would hardly meet the requirement of a

grown up lady. Even if the court below had gone wrong, it is

only towards leniency. The revision petitioner is an able bodied

person. He can find out a remunerating job to maintain the

respondent reasonably. The quantum awarded does not require

any interference.

R.P.F.C.No.1/2006                  5




      8.     In the result, this Revision Petition is dismissed. The

respondent is at liberty to apply for enhancement. No costs.

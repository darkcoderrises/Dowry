                      Crl.M.C.No. 2209 of 2013
                   ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 16th day of July, 2013

                                O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No.157 of 2011

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Mavelikkara    which is

a case instituted upon the police report in Crime No.48 of 2011 of

Kurathikad Police Station for the offence punishable under Section

498A read with Section 34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure

A FIR and charge and all subsequent proceedings in C.C.No.157 of

2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Mavelikkara as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.     The allegation in the above case is that the first

respondent/the de facto complainant is married by the first petitioner/

first accused on 27.2.2010 and at the time of marriage, according to

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                   :-2-:

the de facto complainant, she was given 25 sovereigns of gold

ornaments and `3 lakhs by her parents and after the marriage, she

resided along with the first accused/husband in his house.       According

to the de facto complainant, during her stay in the matrimonial home,

she was subjected to cruelty and harassment demanding more dowry

after having misappropriated gold ornaments and money given to her

by her parents and thereby the accused committed the offence

punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 of I.P.C. Now

the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

first respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

         5. The de facto complainant appeared in person in this Court

and on interaction with her, she submitted that the matter is settled out

of court and she does not want to proceed against the accused.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel.    Annexure C is the affidavit sworn to by the de

facto complainant and Annexure B is the copy of the settlement

arrived between the parties in the Family Court, Alappuzha which is

duly signed by the parties to the dispute and countersigned by the

concerned Advocates. I have verified the documents and materials

produced along with the above petition.         In the given facts and

circumstances of the case and especially in the light of the settlement

arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Section 498 A read with Section 34 of I.P.C. which are more or

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                           :-4-:

less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.                          It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the

first respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has no

further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the

settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note that

the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision reported in Jitendra

Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and another

[2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                 "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on

         considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints

         under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but

         also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such

         matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial

         home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both

         the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of

         the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under

         Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on

         the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                             :-5-:

         Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash

         the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.

                  8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the

         filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and

         Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and

         intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties

         concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a

         compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said

         compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on

         record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants

         herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement

         arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against

         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It

         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected

         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its

         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the

         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections

         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."

                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage

         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same

         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-

         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is

         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any

         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section

         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing

         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.

                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in

         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place

         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                            :-6-:

         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them

         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their

         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement

         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice

         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in

         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power

         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection

         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that

         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of

         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to

         be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A

read with Section 34 of I.P.C. The criminal proceedings for the said

offence originated from the matrimonial issues, which are now settled.

Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the criminal case as well.

                         According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in view of

the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in the above

decision will be squarely applicable in the present case. According to

me, as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the

duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead of compelling

Crl.M.C.No.2209 of 2013

                                 :-7-:

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the

trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the

conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste

of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this

Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure A

FIR and charge and all subsequent proceedings in C.C.No.157 of 2011

pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Mavelikkara.

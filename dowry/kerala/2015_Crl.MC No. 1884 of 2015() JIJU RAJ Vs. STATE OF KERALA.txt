                Dated this the 8th day of April, 2015

                                O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.248/2012 of

Maranelloor Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioner has come up with this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 FIR and

Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.248/2012 of

Maranelloor Police Station as against the petitioner and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1299/2012 pending

before   the     Judicial      First     Class       Magistrate's      Court,

Kattakkada, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Crl.M.C.1884/2015
                              : 2 :



Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 3rd

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto  complainant,     who    is the     3rd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

Crl.M.C.1884/2015
                                : 3 :



that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      8.     Through the settlement, the petitioner and the 3rd

respondent are living together as husband and wife and are

leading a peaceful married life. When all the matrimonial

disputes have been settled between the parties and as the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioner, it is only just and expedient in the interest of

justice to quash the proceedings referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

FIR and Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.248/2012 of

Maranelloor Police Station as against the petitioner and all

further proceedings based on it in C.C.1299/2012 pending

before    the    Judicial  First   Class    Magistrate's Court,

Kattakkada are hereby quashed.

                           V.K.MOHANAN, J
                  ===========================
                       Crl.M.C No.4324 of 2014
                 ============================
                 Dated this the 4th day of August, 2014

                                 ORDER


            The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners, who

are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.929/2014 of Pooyappally

Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 452, 341, 323

and 324 r/w Section 34 of the I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further

proceedings against the petitioner/ accused in Annexure A1 F.I.R in Crime

No. 929/2014 of Pooyappally Police Station now pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - II, Kottarakara as the matter is

settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 20.07.2014 at 8:30

p.m due to a dispute between the 5th respondent/ de facto complainant's son

Saji and the 3rd petitioner/3rd accused regarding money transaction, the

petitioners trespassed into their house and assaulted him, and when the

respondents 3 & 4 tried to protect him the 1st accused assaulted the de facto

Crl.M.C No.4324/2014                2



complainant with an unknown weapon and thereby she sustained a minor

injury on her forehead. It is also alleged that the 1st petitioner assaulted

the 4th respondent with a wooden piece. It is further alleged that the 2nd

accused twisted the hand of the de facto complainant's grand son and he

suffered pain and thus, the accused have committed the aforesaid offences

and now, the case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of

court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the

counsel for respondents 3 to 5. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse

of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the respondents 3 to 5, who on the basis

of specific instruction received  from the respondents, submitted that the

above respondents does not intend to proceed any further against the

Crl.M.C No.4324/2014                   3



petitioners and they have no grievance against them.

          6.    I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the

dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the

above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only under

Sections 452, 341, 323 and 324 r/w Section 34 of the I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved.         It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter. From

the submission made by the counsel for the respondents 3 to 5, it appears to

me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in which

case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

Crl.M.C No.4324/2014                         4



                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion
           can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing
           a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
           inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given
           to a criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of
           the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
           limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
           engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
           to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power
           to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
           exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute
           would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no
           category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
           transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to
           dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically
           private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
           entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash
           criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
           between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is
           remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put
           accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
           would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite
           full    and   complete   settlement  and    compromise    with   the
           victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

Crl.M.C No.4324/2014                     5



settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C.

can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -A1 F.I.R and

all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime No. 929/2014

ofPooyappally Police Station now pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court - II, Kottarakara.

         This is an application for bail under Section 439 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is the accused in

Crime No.618 of 2009 of Nooranadu Police Station.

      2.    The offences alleged against the petitioner are under

Sections 498A, 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3.    The prosecution case is that on 15.12.2009, the

accused pushed her daughter-in-law and grandson into a well.

The grand son died while the daughter-in-law sustained fracture.

It is alleged that the accused used to harass her daughter-in-law

demanding dowry.        On the date of the incident, there was a

quarrel between the petitioner and her daughter-in-law.             The

daughter-in-law came near the well and she was taking water for

washing her face. The grandson of the petitioner was being

taken by the daughter-in-law of the petitioner and at that time, it

is alleged that the petitioner pushed her daughter-in-law into the

well.

                      Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014
                   ..................................................
               Dated this the 11th day of April, 2014.

                                O R D E R


      This  Criminal      Miscellaneous              Case        is  filed by the

petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.2103 of 2010

(Crime No.391/2010 of Sakthikulangara police station) pending

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam for

quashing the proceedings in view of the settlement under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Code').

      2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.2103/2010 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam. The case was

originated on the basis of a statement given by the                        second

respondent as defacto complainant in Crime No.391/2010 of

Sakthikulangara Police station alleging offences under Sections

341, 324, 506 (1) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

After investigation, Annexure-B final report was filed and it

was taken on file as C.C.No.2103/2010 and pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam. In the meantime,

Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014                   2

the matter has been settled between the parties. The petitioners

and the defacto complainant were friends. The incident

happened due to some misunderstanding between them and

the entire dispute has been resolved in the mediation held due

to intervention of well wishers of both the parties. On account

of the settlement, the defacto complainant does not want to

prosecute the case against               the petitioners    and there is no

possibility of any conviction also on account of the same. Since

some of the offences are non compoundable in nature, they

could not file application for compounding before the court

below. No purpose will be served by proceeding with the case.

So they have no other remedy except to approach this Court

seeking the following relief:

            For these reasons, that may be allowed to be urged

            at the time of hearing, it is most respectfully prayed

            that this Hon'ble Court may be quash Annexure-B

            Final report/charge sheet in Crime No.391/2010 of

            Sakthikulangara Police Station as it is an abuse of

            process of court and all subsequent proceedings

            pursuant to C.C.2103/2010 on the file of the Judicial

            First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam and pass such

            other order, as is deemed fit, secure the ends of

Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014              3

            justice in this case.

        3. The counsel for the second respondent appeared through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled between

the parties and on account of the settlement, the second

respondent does not want to prosecute the petitioners. He had

filed an affidavit stating these facts.

        4. The counsel for the petitioners also submitted that in

view of the settlement no purpose will be served in proceeding

with the case. So, he prayed for allowing the application.

        5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

pending against the petitioners and there is no criminal

antecedents but opposed the application.

        6. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent as defacto complainant

Annexure-A First Information Report was registered as Crime

No.391/2010 of Sakthikulangara police station against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 341, 324 and 506

(i) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. After

investigation Annexure-B final report was filed and it was taken

on file as C.C.No.2103/2010 and it is before the Judicial First

Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014                  4

Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam.

        7. Now the matter has been settled between the parties.

The petitioners as well as the second respondent are friends

and due to intervention of well wishers of both the parties,

the matter has been settled               and the relationship has been

restored.          On account of the settlement, original relationship

between them has been restored and the defacto complainant

does not want to prosecute the case. Further, on account of

the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction also, if the

case is allowed to proceed with.

        8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has held that:

             "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for

             the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences

             arising from commercial, financial mercantile, civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the offences

             arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the

             family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their

             entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014                   5

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because

             of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and

             continuation of criminal case would put accused to

             great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice

             would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal

             case     despite  full and   complete    settlement  and

             compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

             Court must consider whether it would be unfair or

             contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal

             proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of

             law despite settlement and compromise between the

             victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends

             of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to

             an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

             jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."




        9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

also and considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and no public interest is involved and as

it is not a case of offence affecting the society at large and in

view of the settlement, the original relationship has been

Crl.M.C.No.2029 of 2014                 6

restored between the parties and no purpose will be served by

proceeding with the case as conviction will be remote and         it

will be wastage of judicial time, this Court feels that it is a fit

case where power under Section 482 of the Code has to be

invoked to quash the proceedings in order to promote            the

settlement and restoration of relationship between the parties

and the pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the

same.

        10. So, the petition is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C.No.2103/2010 (Crime No.391/2010 of Sakthikulangara

police station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Kollam as against the petitioners is quashed.

        Office is directed to communicate this order          to the

concerned court immediately.

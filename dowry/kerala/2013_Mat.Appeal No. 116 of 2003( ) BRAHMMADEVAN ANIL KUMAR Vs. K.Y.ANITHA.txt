                                  &

          Dated this the 23rd day of September, 2013

Antony Dominic, J.

       This appeal and cross objection arises from the judgment of

the Family Court, Kollam in OS No.44/97. The suit was filed by the

respondent for recovery of `1,10,000/-, for return of A schedule

jewellery or the value thereof estimated at `1,77,640/- and for

return of B schedule movables or the value thereof estimated at

`79,620/-.

       2.   The marriage between the appellant and respondent

was solemnized on 17/5/93 and the parties separated on 2/7/94.

It is thereafter that the suit was filed with the prayers mentioned

above.

       3.   Before the Family Court, on behalf of the respondent/

plaintiff, herself and three other witnesses were examined as PWs

1 to 4 and on behalf of the appellant, who was the defendant,

himself and three other witnesses were examined as DWs 1 to 4.

Exts.A1 to A10(b), Exts.B1 to B3 and Exts.X1 to X3 were also

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                                : 2 :



marked. On conclusion of the trial, the Family Court allowed the

respondent/plaintiff to realise `1,10,000/- and `1,77,640/- towards

the value of the jewellery. The plaintiff's claim for B schedule

movables or its value were declined. Interest was also not

awarded. It is aggrieved by the above judgment of the Family

Court, the appellant/defendant had filed this appeal.

      4.     Respondent/plaintiff has also filed cross objection

No.72/04 aggrieved by the judgment of the Family Court to the

extent recovery of `79,620/- being the value of B schedule

movables and interest were declined.

      5.     We heard the learned counsel for the parties and have

also considered the materials available on record.

      6.     Issue numbers 2 and 3 were framed by the Family

Court in regard to the claim of the respondent that she was

entitled to be returned a total sum of `1,10,000/-. PWs 1 and 2,

respondent and her father, had spoken about this claim. Their

evidence was to the effect that immediately after the marriage,

the appellant had pressed for dowry to the tune of `50,000/- and

that thereafter PW1 reached her parental home with the appellant

on 20/5/93 and that on that day `30,000/- was given to the

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                               :   3 :



appellant. It is also in evidence that subsequently on further

harassment, `20,000/- was paid on 27/5/93, `10,000/- each was

paid on 17/6/93, 25/6/93 and 28/7/93 and that `30,000/- was paid

on 18/10/93. Evidence also showed that `25,000/- was withdrawn

by PW2, the father from the Co-operative Bank and that `30,000/-

was withdrawn from SBT, Karunagappally and `20,000/- was

withdrawn from Federal Bank, Karunagapally.          It is also their

evidence that `40,000/- was available with PW2. According to

them, payment was made from out of this amount.

      7.     While PWs 1 and 2 gave evidence to the aforesaid

effect, the appellant did not mount the box or tender evidence.

Instead he was contended by examining his power of attorney

holder, his father. That apart, it is also found by the Family Court

that this claim was urged by the respondent by issuing Ext.A1

notice. Though the notice was served on the appellant, he had not

chosen to contradict the claim.       The Family Court also made

reference to Ext.A10 series of passbooks which showed that PW2,

the father of the respondent had withdrawn amounts from the

Banks as claimed by him. In the light of the above evidence and

particularly on account of the non availability of the appellant for

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                                 : 4 :



cross examination before the Family Court, we cannot find fault

with the Court in having accepted the case of the respondent

entitling her to recover an amount of `1,10,000/- from the

appellant.

      8.     Issue numbers 4 and 5 were framed regarding the

claim of the respondent for recovery of 413 grams of gold

ornaments or its value. It was the case of the respondent that at

the time of her marriage, she was wearing 413 grams of jewellery.

According to her, she had entrusted the same to the appellant.

She also contended that the appellant had pledged 279 grams of

gold ornaments on two occasions and that the balance jewellery

is also still available with him. PWs 1 and 2 had spoken in support

of the claim. In addition to this, they also examined PW3, the

Secretary of SNDP branch, Adinadu South, through him, Ext.A3,

the marriage register maintained at the branch was produced.

Page 28 of this document showed that at the time of marriage,

PW1 was given around 45 sovereigns of gold. This document was

signed by PW1, the father of the appellant. In so far as this claim

of the respondent is concerned, the case of the appellant was that

she was having around 30 sovereigns of gold and that he is not

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                               :   5 :



aware of either the quantity or the details. He also contended that

the entire gold ornaments were with the respondent herself. In so

far as Ext.A3 marriage register produced by PW3 is concerned, his

case was that it was a fabricated document. However, evidence

before the Family Court would show that Ext.A1 notice remained

unanswered.

      9.     As far as the quantity of gold which was owned by the

respondent is concerned, that was supported by Ext.A3 marriage

register. In so far as the case of the appellant that Ext.A3

marriage register was a fabricated document is concerned,

admittedly, he had not made any such complaint to any of the

authorities.    It was also in evidence that 279 grams of gold

ornaments belonging to the respondent wife was pledged by the

appellant on two occasions. Though he admitted the fact that he

had pledged ornaments and this was proved by Exts.A4 to A8, his

case was that he had pledged the ornaments for the benefit of

PW2 as he was not a member of the Co-operative Society where it

was pledged. But evidence available before the Family Court

would show that PW2 was a member of the Co-operative Bank

which belied that contention of the appellant. Further, in this

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                               : 6 :



context, the Family Court has taken note of the fact that despite

having pleaded that the ornaments were allegedly pledged on the

instruction of PW2 and that the amount received was paid to him,

the person who set up that plea, the appellant herein, did not

mount the box or testify the same before the Family Court. It was

therefore that the Family Court refused to accept the case of the

appellant that the ornaments were pledged on the instruction of

PW2. Evidently therefore, the quantity of gold ornaments owned

by the respondent was proved by Ext.A3.    Its entrustment again

stood proved by the conduct of the appellant himself in having

pledged a portion thereof on two occasions. That apart, the

appellant having not mounted the box or tendered evidence by

himself, did not prove what he pleaded. It was in such

circumstances that the Family court upheld the entitlement of the

respondent for recovery of 413 grams of gold ornaments or

`1,77,640/- being its value.

      10. Thus the contentions raised in MA No.116/03 are

rejected and the appeal stands dismissed.

      11. What remains is cross objection No.72/04 filed by the

wife. Her first grievance is regarding the decree of the Family

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                                :  7 :



Court declining her claim for recovery of `79,620/- being the value

of B schedule movables. This claim of the wife has been

considered by the Family court in additional issue No.7. The

judgment itself shows that the main reason which persuaded the

Family Court to decline this claim was the absence of any

documentary evidence supporting either the purchase of the

items mentioned in B schedule or its entrustment to the husband.

Even in the cross objection, the wife has no case that any such

evidence was adduced before the Family Court. As a result, this

finding of the Family Court does not call for any interference.

      12. The second grievance is that although her claim for

recovery of `1,10,000/- and the value of 413 grams of gold were

upheld by the Family Court, the Family Court did not award

interest and cost. As far as the interest is concerned, we feel that

the wife is fully justified in her claim that when a decree for

payment of money is passed, the Family Court should have

awarded interest. We therefore award interest at the rate of 9%

on the decree amount passed by the Family Court from the date

of petition till the date of realisation. In so far as the cost which

was declined is concerned, in our view, awarding of cost is fully

Mat. Appeal No. 116 OF 2003
&
Cross Objection No.72 OF 2004
                                 :   8 :



within the discretion of the Family Court and if that discretion has

been exercised in a particular manner, unless any perversity is

made out, this Court will not be justified in interfering with the

same. We do not find any such vitiating factor justifying

interference.

      In the result, MA No.116/03 will stand dismissed and Cross

Objection No.72/04 will stand disposed of awarding interest on

the amount decreed by the Family Court at the rate of 9% from

the date of petition till the date of realisation.

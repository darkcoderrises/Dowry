             ------------------------------------------------
            Dated this the 8th day of October, 2015.

                              O R D E R

        Application for pre-arrest bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.     Petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.1104 of

2015 of Kondotty Police Station registered for offences

punishable under Section 498A r/w Section 34 I.P.C and Section

3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention

of Atrocities) Act (for short 'SC/ST (P.A) Act').

     3.    Prosecution case, in short, is that the defacto

complainant, who is the daughter-in-law of the petitioner was

harassed by the accused persons demanding more dowry. That

apart, the petitioner allegedly called her caste name and thereby

constituting an offence under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST (P.A)

Act. Learned counsel for the petitioner relying on Annexure A2

complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the Deputy

Superintendent of Police took me through various portions of it

B.A No.5871 of 2015                  2




to show that the allegation of offence under Section 3(1)(x) of

SC/ST (P.A) Act is not maintainable for the simple reason that

the defacto complainant has no case that the caste name was

called out in public with a view to insult or annoy her.

       4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

       5.      Considering the facts and circumstance of the case, I

am of the view that the petitioner is entitled to plead for pre-

arrest bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Therefore, following directions are made :

          1.     Petitioner   shall   surrender     before    the

                investigating officer within a period of one

                week from today and submit herself for

                interrogation. In that event, the petitioner

                shall be released on bail on executing a bond

                for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand

                only) with two solvent sureties each for the

                like sum to the satisfaction of the Investigating

                Officer.

B.A No.5871 of 2015                   3




         2.    The sureties shall produce documents to

               establish their identity and solvency.

         3. Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating

               Officer as and when directed.

        4.     Petitioner shall not influence or intimidate

              witnesses.

          If any of the above conditions is violated by the petitioner,

the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction is free to cancel the bail.

               Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in
                 Crl.R.P No. 580 of 2010

           Dated this the 14th day of July, 2015



                          ORDER


     The   revision    petitioners   are    the   accused in

C.C No. 892/2004 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Vadakara as well as the appellant in

Criminal Appeal No. 596/2007 on the files of Additional

District & Sessions Court, Vadakara. They were prosecuted

for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 427,

447 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and

convicted thereunder.       All accused are sentenced to

undergo simple imprisonment for one month each under

Section 143 IPC, simple imprisonment for three months

each under Section 147 IPC, simple imprisonment for four

months each and to pay a fine of 2,000/- each under

Section 427 IPC and simple imprisonment for one month

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         2

under Section 447 read with Section 149 IPC. Out of the

fine amount recovered, half of the amount shall be given to

PW1 under Section 357(1)(b) Cr.P.C. In default, to undergo

simple imprisonment for two months each.              This revision

petition is filed challenging the concurrent findings of

conviction and sentence.

      2.     In the above Crl.MA, it is stated that the dispute

between the petitioners and the 1st respondent has been

amicably settled out of court and the 1st respondent is not

having any further complaint in the matter. The dispute was

purely personal in nature. So, the 1st respondent does not

intend to proceed against the petitioners. In support of the

petition signed by both parties and counter signed by the

respective counsel, the 1st respondent has filed an affidavit

stating the said fact.

      3.     The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

has prayed for compounding the offences in view of the

decision of the Apex Court in Gian Singh V. State of

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         3

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

      4.     The learned counsel for the 1st respondent also

submits that the averments in the petition as well as in the

affidavit are true to the best of his knowledge and belief and

now the 1st respondent has no subsisting grievance at all.

      5.     I have meticulously considered the decision laid

down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108

(SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the Apex

Court, on a reference, considered the question whether the

High Court has power to quash criminal proceedings

involving non-compoundable offences on the basis of the

compromise reached between the offender and the victim

and answered as given below:

             "57.      The position that emerges from the

             above discussion can be summarised thus: the

             power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

             proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of

             its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different

             from the power given to a criminal court for

             compounding the offences under S.320 of the

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         4

             Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

             no statutory limitation but it has to be

             exercised      in   accord     with  the  guideline

             engrafted in such power viz;(1) to secure the

             ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the

             process of any Court. In what cases power to

             quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or

             F.I.R. may be exercised where the offender and

             victim have settled their dispute would depend

             on the facts and circumstances of each case

             and no category can be prescribed. However,

             before exercise of such power, the High Court

             must have due regard to the nature and gravity

             of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of

             mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,

             dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even

             though the victim or victim's family and the

             offender      have    settled    the dispute.  Such

             offences are not private in nature and have

             serious impact on society.           Similarly, any

             compromise between the victim and offender

             in relation to the offences under special

             statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or

             the offences committed by public servants

             while working in that capacity etc; cannot

             provide for any basis for quashing criminal

             proceedings involving such offences.        But the

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         5

             criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

             footing     for    the    purposes    of   quashing,

             particularly      the     offences    arising   from

             commercial,         financial,    mercantile,   civil,

             partnership or such like transactions or the

             offences arising out of matrimony relating to

             dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the

             wrong is basically private or personal in nature

             and the parties have resolved their entire

             dispute. In this category of cases, High Court

             may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

             because of the compromise between the

             offender      and     victim,    the  possibility of

             conviction       is   remote       and  bleak    and

             continuation of criminal case would put

             accused to great oppression and prejudice and

             extreme injustice would be caused to him by

             not quashing the criminal case despite full and

             complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim. In other words, the High Court must

             consider whether it would be unfair or contrary

             to the interest of justice to continue with the

             criminal proceeding or continuation of the

             criminal proceeding would tantamount to

             abuse of process of law despite settlement and

             compromise between the victim and wrongdoer

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         6

             and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

             appropriate that criminal case is put to an end

             and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

             affirmative, the High Court shall be well within

             its    jurisdiction    to     quash   the criminal

             proceeding."

        6.   In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is, whether

the non-compoundable offence involved in this case can be

compounded, in the exercise of the inherent power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prima facie,

I find that the offences alleged against the petitioners will

not come under the category of non-compoundable

offences, which are specifically excluded from composition,

in the exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the

Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by the 1st respondent, it

is seen that the dispute between the accused and the 1st

respondent had been amicably settled and, at present, the

1st respondent has no subsisting grievance at all. The 1st

respondent         does not want to proceed with prosecution

Crl.M.A.No.6662 of 2014 in Crl.R.P.No. 580 of 2010
                                         7

against the accused. In view of the compromise between the

petitioner and the 1st respondent, I find that the possibility

of conviction is remote, bleak and continuation of the

criminal case would, put the parties to great oppression,

prejudice and also tantamount to abuse of the process of

the court.        The present criminal prosecution against the

accused must be put to an end to secure the interest of

justice.

      7.     Therefore, in the light of the above decision, in

exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C,

permission is granted to compound all the offences and

composition is recorded. The composition of the offences

will have the acquittal of the accused under sub Section (8)

of Section 320 of the Cr.P.C.

             This Crl.M.A is allowed.

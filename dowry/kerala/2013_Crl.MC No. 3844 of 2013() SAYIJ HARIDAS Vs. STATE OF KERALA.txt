                           BHAVADASAN, J.

                   Crl.M.C. No. 3844 of 2013

                                ORDER


          This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to have all further

proceedings in C.C.842 of 2009 pending before the JFCM-V,

Kozhikode quashed.

          2. Petitioners stand accused of having committed

offences punishable under Sections 120B, 417 and 420 of

Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

          3. It is unnecessary to go into the facts of the case

for the simple reason that the petitioners have chosen to

implead the defacto complainant as second respondent in this

proceedings who represents that the matter has been settled

and the defacto complainant has no further grievance in the

matter. It is also pointed out that the victim has got married

and is leading a peaceful life.

Crl.M.C.3844/2013.               2

             4.   In the light of the submission made by the

learned counsel for the second respondent, who has entered

appearance through counsel, it is felt that continuance of the

proceedings will be only an exercise in futility.

             In the result, this petition is allowed, all further

proceedings in C.C. 842 of 2009 on the file of the JFCM-VI,

Kozhikode including the final report shall stand quashed and

the petitioners shall stand discharged.




                                              P. BHAVADASAN,
                                                   JUDGE

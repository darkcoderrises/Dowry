           Bail Application No.5748 of 2010
         ------------------------------------------------
     Dated this the 16th day of September, 2010

                            ORDER


     The petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 4 in Crime

No.837/2010 of Ezhukone Police Station for an offence

punishable under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,

seek anticipatory bail.

     2.   The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the

application.

     3.    Anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of

this nature. But at the same time, I am inclined to permit

the petitioners to surrender before the Investigating

Officer for the purpose of interrogation and then to have

their application for bail considered by the Magistrate

having jurisdiction.     Accordingly, the petitioners shall

surrender before the investigating officer on 27/9/2010

or on 28/9/2010 for the purpose of interrogation and

recovery of incriminating material, if any. The petitioners

shall thereafter be produced before the Magistrate who

Bail Appln.No.5748/2010
                             : 2 :


on being satisfied that the petitioners have been

interrogated by the police shall consider and dispose of

their application for regular bail preferably on the same

date on which it is filed.

      This petition is disposed of as above.

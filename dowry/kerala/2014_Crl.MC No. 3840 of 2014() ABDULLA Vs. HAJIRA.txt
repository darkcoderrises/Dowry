                         V.K.MOHANAN, J
               ===========================
                      Crl.M.C No.3840 of 2014
               ============================
                Dated this the 31st day of July, 2014

                                ORDER


      The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioner,

who is accused in L.P .No.60/2012 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Nadapuram, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No.279/2010 of Valayam Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections.498A, 406, 354 and 511 of 376 r/w

34 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure I final report and all

further proceedings in L.P No.60/2012 pending before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Nadapuram in Crime No.279/2010 of Valayam

Police Station as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.  The allegation in the above case is that on 23.03.2008, the

first accused Abdulla married de facto complainant as per religious

Crl.M.C No.3840/2014                2



rites and they were living as husband and wife. While so A1 to A4 at

their residence XV/360 of Vanimel Panchayath, mentally and

physically ill treated the de facto complainant stating that the gold

ornaments given to the de facto complainant at the time of marriage

was so less and by demanding more gold and money and also by

stating that the first accused would have received the better alliance.

The second accused at many occasions caught hold the body of the de

facto complainant and ill treated her and on 20.01.2009 night while the

de facto complainant and second accused alone were therein the house

the second accused caught hold of the de facto complainant and

attempted to commit sexual inter course. 46 = sovereigns of gold

ornaments were given to the de facto complainant at the time of

marriage by the family members except 6 sovereigns chain and 2

bangles each of 1 sovereign and 1 stud having 1 sovereign all other

gold ornaments were obtained by accused No.2, 3 and 4 in the guise of

keeping that and when the de facto complainant had demanded back

that, that has not been returned and they have committed breach of trust

Crl.M.C No.3840/2014                   3



and thereby the accused has committed that aforesaid offences, and

now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

1st respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during

the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between

the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

          6.   I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced

along with the above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the

case and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties

to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in

Crl.M.C No.3840/2014                         4



allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the

case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are only

under Sections.498A, 406, 354 and 511 of 376 r/w 34 of I.P.C. which

are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is

pertinent to note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the matter.

From the submission made by the counsel for the 1st respondent, it appears

to me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this

juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court

reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)], in

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.      The position that emerges from the above
          discussion can be summarised thus:         the power of the High
          Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
          exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
          the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
          offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
          plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
          in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
          of any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
          proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
          offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on

Crl.M.C No.3840/2014                          5



           the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
           prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
           purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such
           like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
           relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is
           basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
           resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
           Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of
           the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility
           of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
           case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
           extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite        full and complete settlement and
           compromise with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present

case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

Crl.M.C No.3840/2014                 6



waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure -I final

report and all further proceedings pending against the petitioners in L.P

No.60/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nadapuram in

Crime No. 279/2010 of Valayam Police Station.

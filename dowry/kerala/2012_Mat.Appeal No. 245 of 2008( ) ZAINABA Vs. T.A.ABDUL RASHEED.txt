                          J U D G M E N T


Joseph Francis, J.

           Mat.    Appeal     896     of   2011     is   filed by the

respondent/husband in O.P.No.251 of 2010 on the file of the

Family Court, Kasaragod. The respondent is the petitioner/wife

in that Original Petition, which was filed by her under Section 7

(1)(a) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 and Section 2(ii), (viii)(a)

and (d) and (ix) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act,

1939 (for short, 'the Act'). Mat. Appeal No.245 of 2008 is filed

by the respondent/wife in O.P.No.85 of 2007 on the file of the

Family    Court,    Kasaragod.          The     respondent     is the

petitioner/husband in that Original Petition, which was filed by

him for restitution of conjugal rights. Since the parties in both

the appeals are the same and the questions involved are

interconnected, the above appeals are disposed of by this

common judgment.

           2. The averments of the petitioner/wife in O.P.251 of

2010 are briefly as follows : The marriage between the

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20112




petitioner and the respondent was solemnized on 18.5.2003 as

per the customs prevailing in the community. Nikah ceremony

was performed on 18.5.2003 and the 'Veettukudal' function was

conducted on 14.3.2004. No children are born in the wedlock.

Prior to the marriage proposal, the respondent had contracted

another marriage, which was divorced. No demand for dowry

was made from the side of the respondent at the time of

marriage proposal.           The petitioner's father is a psychiatric

patient. At the time of marriage, the petitioner had completed

her First Year B.Com. degree course and was preparing for the

Second Year. The petitioner accepted the marriage proposal on

condition that she should be allowed to complete her higher

studies.     After the Nikah ceremony, the respondent and his

family members insisted the petitioner to discontinue her

studies. When the family members of the petitioner conveyed

the information regarding discontinuance of her studies, the

respondent insisted for payment of Rs.5,00,000/- and 200

sovereigns of gold ornaments as dowry. He also demanded a

car, but the petitioner's parents were not in a position to

purchase a car. With the help of the relatives, the parents of

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20113




the petitioner gave 183 sovereigns of gold ornaments. After a

few days of the marriage, the respondent and his family

members started to ill-treat the petitioner demanding dowry of

Rs.5,00,000/- and a car.             Many of the gold ornaments were

pledged by the respondent in his name. On 24.12.2004 the

grandfather of the petitioner was hospitalized. Even though all

the family members visited him in the hospital, the respondent

did not take the petitioner to see her sinking grandfather. After

two days, the grandfather died. The respondent threatened her

while going to the hospital that if she disclosed to others the

reason of her swelling on the face, she would be killed. On

27.11.2005 when the petitioner and the respondent were to

attend the       house-warming ceremony of one Mr.Navas and

Arifa, the respondent pointed a revolver on the head of the

petitioner. On 12.2.2007, the respondent took the petitioner to

her house and left there.                On 15.2.2007 at 2 p.m., the

respondent came along with his family members and entered

into the petitioner's room and asked for money. On 14.3.2007,

the father of the respondent came to the house of the petitioner

and asked them to forget all the past incidents.                The

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20114




Manjeshwar Police has registered Crime No.137/2007 against

the respondent and his family members.              The police filed

charge sheet against the respondent and it is now pending

before the C.J.M.Court, Kasaragod for the offence under Section

498A I.P.C.       The Original Petition     filed by the respondent

seeking restitution of conjugal rights (O.P.No.85 of 2007) was

decreed on 13.2.2008. The petitioner filed Mat. Appeal No.245

of 2008 against the said judgment. The respondent treated the

petitioner with cruelty, both mental and physical.             The

respondent neglected her and failed to provide maintenance to

her for the last more than two years continuously. There is an

irretrievable break down in the marital relationship.          The

respondent has misappropriated and disposed of her gold

ornaments given to her at the time of marriage. On the above

allegations, the petitioner prayed for a decree for dissolution of

marriage.

             3. The respondent/husband filed counter contending

as follows : The petition is premature and not maintainable in

law.    The petitioner had filed Mat. Appeal No.245 of 2008

against the decree for restitution of conjugal rights passed in

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20115




favour of the respondent. The decree passed by the Court is

still in force and only the implementation is suspended. Hence

this petition for divorce is not maintainable. It is true that the

'Nikah ceremony' was solemnized on 18.5.2003 and the

'Veettikoodal' ceremony was conducted on 14.3.2004.           The

'Veettikoodal' ceremony was delayed because the father of the

respondent could not come from Singapore prior to March,

2004. The petitioner in her complaint filed before the C.J.M.

Court, Kasaragod stated that she was maintaining a diary

writing the events of the days after the Nikah and she left the

same in the house of the respondent. The Manjeshwar Police

has seized the diary and produced before the C.J.M. Court,

Kasaragod. The events written by her in the diary reveals the

true picture. The petitioner had only 1 = sovereigns of gold

ornaments at the time of fixation of marriage. The respondent

never pledged gold ornaments belonging to the petitioner. The

averment that the respondent did not take the petitioner to

visit her grandfather is false. The petitioner's grandfather died

on 18.12.2004 at Unity Hospital, Mangalore. It is true that the

house warming ceremony of Mr.Navas was on 27.11.2005 at

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20116




Mogral. The averment that the respondent used to point the

revolver to the petitioner and threatened her is false.           The

petitioner is only a stooge in the hands of Navas, who is the

husband of elder sister of the petitioner. The petitioner is not

entitled to relief under the provisions alleged in the petition.

The petition is liable to be dismissed.

             4.      In O.P.No.251/2010, the petitioner/wife was

examined as PW1, the respondent/husband was examined as

RW1 and Exts.B1 to B3 were marked. The Family Court, on

considering the evidence on record, allowed divorce under

Section 2(ii) and (ix) of the Act and the prayer for divorce under

Section 2(viii)(a) and (d) was disallowed. Against the judgment

and decree allowing divorce under Section 2(ii) and (ix) of the

Act, the respondent/husband in that Original Petition            filed

Mat.Appeal No.896 of 2011.

             5. The husband filed O.P.No.85 of 2007 before the

Family Court, Kasaragod for restitution of conjugal rights as the

respondent/wife allegedly left his company on 12.2.2007

without any reasonable cause.             The respondent/wife filed a

detailed counter contending that the petitioner/husband and his

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 7




family     members          treated      her with cruelty and   the

petitioner/husband assaulted her and she was driven out of the

house. The gold ornaments of the respondent were forcibly

removed and misused by the petitioner.              In that Original

Petition , PW1, RW1 and RW2 were examined and Exts.B1 and

B2 were marked.              The Family Court, on considering the

evidence on record, allowed that Original Petition on finding

that the respondent was not at all justified in denying her

company to the petitioner and the respondent was directed to

return to the consortium of the petitioner within a period of two

months from 13.2.2008. Against that judgment and decree, the

respondent/wife filed Mat. Appeal No.245 of 2008.

             6. The learned counsel for the appellant/husband in

Mat.Appeal No.896 of 2011 raised the following contentions, at

the time of argument : The Family Court ought not to have

found that the petitioner therein deserved dissolution of

marriage under Section 2(ii) of the Act, especially when the wife

without any reason refused to stay with the husband in spite of

an order for restitution of conjugal rights. While allowing the

petition under Section 2(ix) of the Act, the Family Court did not

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20118




consider the position of the respondent/husband who holds a

decree for restitution of conjugal rights in his favour.      The

Family Court ought to have found that the petitioner/wife

herself has deserted her husband who has never neglected his

wife. The finding of the court below that the respondent therein

has failed to maintain the petitioner is highly unreasonable.

The decision relied on by the Family Court to allow the petition

for dissolution of marriage between the parties is not applicable

to the facts of this case.

             7.     The learned counsel for the appellant further

submitted that since the divorce decree is liable to be set aside,

the respondent/wife is bound to obey the decree for restitution

of conjugal rights. The learned counsel for the respondent/wife

supported the judgment and decree in O.P.No.251 of 2010 and

submitted that since the divorce decree is passed dissolving the

marriage, decree for restitution of conjugal rights passed in

O.P.No.85 of 2007 has become infructuous.

             8.     The main question to be answered in these

appeals is whether the Family Court is justified in passing the

decree for divorce under Section 2(ii) and (ix) of the Act and if it

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 20119




is justified, what would be the fate of the decree for restitution

of conjugal rights passed in O.P.No.85 of 2007.

             9. Under Section 2(ii) of the Act, the wife is entitled

to obtain a decree for dissolution of marriage, if the husband

has neglected her or has failed to provide maintenance to her

for a period of two years. There is nothing in the wording of

Section 2(ii) of the Act to suggest that the failure to maintain

the wife must be wilful.

             10. In O.P.No.251 of 2010, it is specifically stated by

the petitioner/wife that the respondent has neglected her and

failed to provide maintenance to her for the last more than two

years continuously and under these circumstances, the

petitioner is entitled to get a decree for dissolution of marriage

under Section 2(ii) of the Act.             In answer to this, the

respondent/husband in his counter stated that he has not at all

neglected her and failed to provide maintenance to her and

that the wife, who is living separately without any cause is not

entitled to get separate maintenance under the Mahomedan

Law or any other law. It is further stated that the petitioner has

not even obeyed or complied with the order of the Family Court

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 10




in O.P.No.85 of 2007, directing restitution of conjugal rights. In

that Original Petition , the petitioner/wife was examined as PW1

before the Family Court on 24.8.2011. PW1 deposed in chief

examination         that       since      17.3.2007   till  date,       the

respondent/husband has not paid maintenance to her.                    This

version of PW1 is not challenged by the respondent/husband in

cross examination.           The respondent/husband was examined

before the Family Court in that case on 29.9.2011 as RW1. In

chief examination, he has no case that he had paid

maintenance to the petitioner/wife. In cross-examination, RW1

admitted that they were living separately from 12.2.2007

onwards and that he had not given maintenance to the wife

thereafter. RW1 has no case that he did not give maintenance

to her as she did not comply with the decree for restitution of

conjugal rights in O.P.No.85 of 2007.

             11. In the decision reported in Muhammed Ashraf

v. Nadeera (ILR 2000(3) Kerala 445), it was held thus :

            "In the present case legislature has not made the ground for

            divorce under clause (ii) conditional that neglect or failure to

            provide for maintenance of the wife is without a reasonable

            cause. On the other hand we find in clause (iv) which provides

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 11




            another ground for divorce such a specific condition is added.

            It provides that the wife would be entitled to seek divorce on

            the ground that the husband has failed to perform his marital

            obligations for a period of three years 'without reasonable

            cause'. When the very same legislature under the very same

            section has added the condition 'without reasonable cause' in

            clause (iv), but omitted the same in clause (ii), it is not for this

            court to add that condition under clause (ii) also.

                                  x x x x x x x x x x x x x

            As the clause itself enacts that a right to a dissolution will be

            the consequence of an omission to maintain, every omission to

            maintain must be spoken of as a failure to maintain in this

            enactment. The fact that there are no further qualifying words

            is sufficient to show that nothing more than an omission to

            maintain could possibly be intended."

              12.     In the decision reported in Veeran Sayvu

Ravuthar v. Beevathumma (2002(2) KLT 741), it was held in

paragraph 19 as follows :

                            "19.    Thus, the consistent view taken by this

             Court is that "the construction of Clause (ii) of S. 2 is in

             consonance with the Islamic law on the subject..... There is

             therefore no justification in introducing the words "without

             reasonable cause" into Clause (ii).          The Legislature in its

             wisdom by providing those words in clause (iv) has not

             thought it necessary to provide this restricting in Clause (ii).

             "Accordingly this Court held that a wife under such

             circumstances, even if she had contributed for not to maintain

             her or even if she was not entitled for maintenance, could

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 12




             have applied for dissolution of marriage under S. 2(ii) on the

             ground that the husband had neglected or failed to provide for

             her maintenance for a period of two years.           When the

             consistent view followed by this Court in these three

             decisions, accepting the view taken by Tayabji, C.J., in

             Noorbibi's case, is so clear, there is no reason at all for

             reconsideration, taking into account the phraseology used in

             S. 2(ii) as compared to S. 2(iv). The excuse if any put forth by

             the husband in maintaining the wife is not at all a relevant

             consideration while considering the ground for dissolution of

             marriage by the wife under S. 2(ii) of the Act. So we are in

             respectful agreement with the view taken by this Court in the

             earlier decisions in Yousuf Rawthan, Aboobacker Haji and

             Moosa's cases."



             13. In the present case, it is not disputed that the

respondent/husband failed to maintain the petitioner/wife for

more than two years. Therefore, the Family Court was justified

in granting a decree for divorce under Section 2(ii) of the Act.

             14.      In the Original Petition, it is alleged by the

petitioner/wife that there is irretrievable break down of the

marital relationship and therefore, the petitioner is entitled to

get divorce under Section 2(ix) of the Act. In the counter, it is

stated by the respondent/husband that there is no irretrievable

break down of the marital relationship. RW1 admits that from

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 13




12.2.2007 onwards, PW1 is residing separately and that she is

not interested in residing with him and that PW1 filed a

complaint before the Police, alleging offence under Section

498A of the I.P.C.

             15.       Section 2(ix) of the Act makes statutory

provision for the wife for dissolution of marriage on the ground

which is recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriage

under the Muslim Law. This Court, in the decision reported in

Mohammed v. Sainaba Umma (1987(1) KLT 712) held that

Section 2(ix) of the Act is really in the form of a residuary

ground where the courts have an area of discretion. In that

case, the wife lived separately for a number of years and she

prayed for dissolution of marriage on the ground of irretrievable

break down of marriage.                  This Court held that in such

circumstances, Islam concedes the right to the wife to seek

dissolution of marriage on the ground of Khula.

             16.      In Amna Khatoon v. Kashim Ansari (AIR

2001 Jharkhand 28), the Jharkhand High Court dissolved a

marriage under Section 2(ix) of the Act on the ground of

irretrievable break down of marriage. In the present case, it

Mat. Appeal Nos.245 of 2008 & 896 of 2011 14




has come out in evidence that the marriage between the

petitioner and the respondent was irretrievably broken down.

Therefore, the Family Court was perfectly justified in granting a

decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 2(ix) of the

Act. Therefore, we are of the view that Mat. Appeal No.896 of

2011 is liable to be dismissed as it is without any merits.

             17. It is well settled that in appropriate cases, the

appellate court can take subsequent events into consideration

in order to do complete justice between the parties. Since the

marriage between the petitioner and the respondent in

O.P.No.85 of 2007 on the file of the Family Court, Kasaragod is

dissolved as per the judgment and decree in O.P.No.251 of

2010, the decree for restitution of conjugal rights granted in

O.P.No.85 of 2007 has become in-executable.             Therefore,

Mat.Appeal No.245 of 2008 has to be allowed and the judgment

and decree in O.P.No.85 of 2007 on the file of the Family Court,

Kasaragod has to be set aside.

            ................................................................
                    CRL. M.C. No.6904 of 2014
            ...............................................................
            Dated this the 15th day of December, 2014

                                   O R D E R


      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.331/11 of the

Perumpadappu Police Station, Malappuram registered for the

offence punishable under Sections 406, and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-B final report in

Crime No.331/11 of the Perumpadappu Police Station,

Malappuram and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.144/12 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Ponnani, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty within

the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry,

after misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.   The defacto complainant, who is the 1st respondent

herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the matters in

dispute between her and the petitioners have been amicably

settled and, therefore, she has no complaints against the

petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings in the matter

referred to above can be quashed.            She has entered

appearance through her counsel. The learned counsel for the

defacto complainant also endorses the fact that the affidavit

has been sworn in by the defacto complainant on her own

volition.

      7.   When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

     In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are allowed and Annexure-

B final report in Crime No.331/11 of the Perumpadappu Police

Station, Malappuram and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C.No.144/12 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Ponnani, are hereby quashed.

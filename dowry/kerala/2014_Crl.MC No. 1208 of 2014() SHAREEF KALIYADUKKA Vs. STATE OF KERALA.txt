                         Crl. M.C. No.1208 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 19th day of February, 2014


                                     O R D E R



          This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the

petitioner to quash the proceedings in L.P.C.No.6/2013 on

the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Hosdurg, on the basis of the composition entered into

between the petitioner and the defacto-complainant under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

called the 'Code').

          2.      It is alleged in the petition that, the

petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.519/2010 of

Bekal Police Station. The case was registered on the basis

of the statement given by the 2nd respondent as defacto-

complainant, against the petitioner, alleging offence under

Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation,

final report was filed and it was taken on the file as

C.C.No.1091/2010 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg. Since the petitioner was

Crl. M.C. No.1208 of 2014
                                   2

absconding, after completing the procedure the case was

transferred to the register of long pending cases and it is

now pending before that court as L.P.C. No.6/2013. In the

meantime, the petitioner settled the matter with the

defacto-complainant. Now there is no dispute between the

petitioner and the defacto-complainant. The defacto-

complainant does not want to proceed with the prosecution.

Since the offence alleged is non-compoundable in nature,

the same cannot be compounded before the court below.

So the petitioner has no other option, but to approach this

court under Section 482 of the 'Code'. Hence the petition is

filed by the petitioner, seeking the following relief:

            "In view of the above grounds and the grounds that
      may be urged at the time of hearing this Hon'ble Court
      may be pleased to quash all further proceedings pending
      against the petitioner in LPC No.6/2013 on the file of
      Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg."

            3.    The     2nd  respondent       appeared   through

counsel and submitted that the matter has been settled and

the defacto-complainant filed an affidavit to that effect. He

does not want to proceed against the petitioner.

Crl. M.C. No.1208 of 2014
                                 3

            4.    Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions

submitted that, there was a case against the petitioner in

the year 2008, in which he was acquitted after trial. There

is no other crime against the petitioner pending now.

            5.    It is an admitted fact that, in this case, crime

No.519/2010 was registered on the basis of the statement

given by the 2nd respondent against the petitioner, alleging

offence under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code and

later after filing Annexure-A1 final report, it was taken on

file as C.C.No.1091/2010 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrte Court-II, Hosdurg. It is also an admitted

fact that since the petitioner did not appear before the court

below, the case was transferred to the register of long

pending cases and it is pending as L.P.C. No.6/2013 before

that court. Now the matter has been settled between the

parties. The defacto-complainant filed an affidavit stating

that, he did not sustain any serious injuries and it was not a

premeditated incident and he has no grievance against the

Crl. M.C. No.1208 of 2014
                                     4

petitioner now.

             6.    It is true that the petitioner had involved in a

crime in the year 2008 and that was ended in acquittal.

That cannot be said that, he is a habitual offender and a

person creating nuisance in the society. Now the matter

has been settled between the parties and harmony has been

restored      between      the     defacto-complainant          and    the

petitioner. In the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has held that:

             "The position that emerges from the above discussion
      can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
      quashing a criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court.    In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised
      where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case an no
      category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such
      power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
      depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot
      be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family
      and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are
      not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
      Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in

Crl. M.C. No.1208 of 2014
                                       5

      relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention
      of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants
      while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
      basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such
      offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
      pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the wrong
      is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
      resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
      Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim, the
      possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
      of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
      quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
      settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
      the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal
      proceedings or continuation of the criminal proceedings would
      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and
      compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether
      to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question
      (s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


It cannot be said that on the basis of the allegations that

there is any public interest involved in the case. It was a

private dispute that resulted in the commission of the crime.

            Considering the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the settlement arrived at

between the petitioner and the defacto-complainant and

there is no possibility of conviction being entered into, if the

                                  6

trial is allowed to be proceeded with and it will be only a

wastage of judicial time, to allow the case to continue on

file, I feel that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the `Code' has to be invoked to quash the

proceedings. So the application is allowed and further

proceedings in L.P.C.No.6/2013 (C.C.No.1091/2010 in crime

No.519/2010 of Bekal Police Station) of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg, against the petitioner is

quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court for further action.

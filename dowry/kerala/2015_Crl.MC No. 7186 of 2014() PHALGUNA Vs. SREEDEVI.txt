                  CRL. M.C. No.7186 of 2014
           ...............................................................
             Dated this the 6th day of January, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.254/11 of the

Vazhakkad Police Station, Malappuram registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A Final Report in

Crime   No.254/11          of     the      Vazhakkad            Police     Station,

Malappuram and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.717/14 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Manjeri, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

the wife of the 1st accused, and treated her with cruelty

CRL.M.C.No.7186 of 2014
                               -: 2 :-



within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more    dowry,      after  misappropriating her   entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.    The      defacto  complainant, who    is   the    1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners, and, hence, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.7186 of 2014
                              -: 3 :-



entered appearance through her counsel.          The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A

Final Report in Crime No.254/11 of the Vazhakkad Police

Station, Malappuram and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C.No.717/14 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-II, Manjeri, are hereby quashed.

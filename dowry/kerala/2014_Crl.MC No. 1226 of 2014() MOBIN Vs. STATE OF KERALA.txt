                        Crl.M.C.No. 1226 of 2014
                          ----------------------
               Dated this the 21st day of February, 2014.

                                O R D E R
                                 ------------

      This is an application filed by the petitioners, who are accused

Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.407/2013 of Upputhara Police Station in

Idukki District, on the basis of the settlement arrived at between

the parties under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code.

      2.       It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are

accused Nos.1and 2 in Crime No.407/13 of Upputhara                Police

Station, which was registered on the basis of the statement given

by the second respondent alleging offences under Sections 447,

324, 294(b) r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code. The dispute between the

petitioners and the second respondent were settled out of Court

and the second respondent has no intention to continue with the

prosecution. They are neighbours and harmony between them are

restored on account of the settlement arrived due to the

intervention of the mediators and well wishers.            There is no

possibility of conviction being entered even if ultimately, the final

report is being filed, on account of the         settlement.  Since the

Investigating Officer did not accept the settlement and close the

crime file, they have no option but to approach this Court to seek

the following reliefs.

         " It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble court may
         be     pleased to quash Annexure-I First Information Report
         and all further proceedings pursuant to the same, to secure

 Crl.M.C.No. 1226 of 2014
                                 2

         the ends     of justice."

      3.     The 2nd respondent appeared through the counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and

he has no objection in quashing all proceedings.           The second

respondent also filed an affidavit stating these facts.            On

instructions as directed by this Court, the learned Public Prosecutor

submitted that except this case there is no other case against the

petitioners and it was a private dispute between the neighbours,

which resulted in the registration of the crime.

      4.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given by the second respondent, Annexure A crime was registered

as Crime No. 407/2013 of Upputhara Police Station against the

petitioner alleging offences u/s 443, 324, 294(b), r/w 34 IPC. The

investigation is in the preliminary stage. After the registration of

crime, due to the intervention of the mediators, the matter has

been settled between the defacto complainant and the petitioners.

Since the police is not closing the file, they approached this Court to

quash proceedings.

      5.     Normally, this Court, will not interfere and quash the

proceedings at the crime stage, unless it is satisfied that even on

the basis of the allegations made in the First Information Statement

no criminal offences is made out. But in this case, the matter has

been settled between the parties. They are neighbours as well. In

the decision in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab 2012(4) KLT

Crl.M.C.No. 1226 of 2014
                                3

108 (SC) the Honourable Supreme Court held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above discussion
    can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in
    quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
    exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
    the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
    offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
    plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
    in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
    secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
    of any Court.      In what cases power to quash the criminal
    proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
    offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on
    the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
    be prescribed.     However, before exercise of such power, the
    High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of
    the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
    offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
    quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the
    offender have settled the dispute.         Such offences are not
    private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly,
    any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to
    the offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption
    Act or the offences committed by public servants while working
    in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing
    criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
    cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
    stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
    particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial,
    mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
    offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the
    family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal
    in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In
    this category of case, High Court may quash criminal
    proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between
    the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
    and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused
    to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would
    be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
    and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
    other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be
    unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
    criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
    would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement
    and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and
    whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that
    criminal case is put to end and if the answer to the above
    question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within
    its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

      6.    Considering the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties and they are neighbours and the harmony has

been restored between them and now they are living in cordial

relationship and also in view of the settlement arrived between the

parties, there is no possibility of filling a final report for the offences

alleged against the petitioners as the defacto complainant is not

going to co-operate with the investigating agency, I feel that, this is

a fit case, where the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure has to be invoked to quash the proceedings to save

judicial time as well as the time of Investigating agency in this

matter . So the application is allowed, and further proceedings in

Crime No. 407/2013 of Upputhara Police Station against the

petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this order

to the concerned court, namely, Judicial First Class Magistrate

Peerumedu to inform the concerned police station for the further

necessary action in this regard.

                               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

          Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.   Petitioner        is    the      1st    accused         in  Crime

No.1021/2014 of Manjeri Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 IPC.

     3.   The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed his wife, who is the de facto

complainant, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning

of Section 498A IPC by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money.

     4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

     5.   The crime has been registered on the basis of a

private complaint filed by the de facto complainant before

the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Manjeri, which was

BA.8091/2014
                                 : 2 :



referred to the police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. It seems

that the investigation of this case is practically over. The

custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not required for the

continued investigation of this case. Matters being so, I am

of the view that this is a fit case wherein anticipatory bail

can be granted to the petitioner, especially when the

offences involved are matrimonial offences.

     6.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioner shall report before the

      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

      on all Wednesdays and Saturdays, commencing

      from 26.11.2014 for a period of three months or till

BA.8091/2014
                                  : 3 :



     the filing of the final report in this case, whichever is

     earlier.


            (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.


            (iii) The    petitioner    shall   make   himself

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the investigating officer.


            (iv)  The petitioner shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

             Dated this the 11th day of April 2013

                           ORDER




     The Revision petitioner is the 1st respondent in

Miscellaneous case (DVC No.85/2009) on the files of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court -II, Mananthavady as well as

appellant in Criminal Appeal No.200/2010 on the files of

Sessions Court, Wayanad at Kalpetta. The said petition

was filed by the 1st respondent herein under Sections 9(b)

& 37(2)(c) of the Protection of Women from Domestic

Violence Act of 2005.      The 1st respondent claimed an

amount of Rs.3,000/- per month from the Revision

petitioner. It   was     further alleged that the Revision

petitioner is not looking after her after taking away her

money and ornaments. After trial, the learned Magistrate

passed the following orders:

CRL.R.P.NO. 737 of 2013          : 2 :

      "1. The respondents are restrained from committing
      any domestic violence or engaging or abetting the
      commission of it.
      2. R1 shall pay Rs.3,000/- per month to the applicant
      as monthly maintenance.
      3. Respondents shall pay Rs.50,000/- to the applicant
      for mental and physical harassment sustained to her.
      4.    The respondents shall return the 8 sovereigns of
      gold ornaments or value of equal to it to the applicant
      along with Rs.1,00,000/- received by them as dowry.
      5.     The respondents shall not commit damage or
      causing any attempt to destroy her property."


      2. The Revision petitioner along with 2nd and 3rd

respondents filed Criminal appeal No.200/2010 challenging

the order passed by the learned Magistrate. According to

the Revision petitioner , the appeal was filed with a delay of

238     days.       Therefore, the   Revision  Petitioner   filed

Crl.M.P.No.179/2010 to condone the delay. The learned

Sessions Judge condoned the delay on condition that the

Revision petitioner shall pay Rs.5,000/- as cost to the

respondent on or before 15/12/2010.               The counsel

appearing for the Revision Petitioner         submits that the

counsel appeared for the Revision Petitioner at the trial

court did not inform the Revision petitioner regarding the

CRL.R.P.NO. 737 of 2013          : 3 :


progress of the case as well as the direction to pay cost on

or before 15/12/2010. Therefore, he could not pay the cost

on or before 15/12/2010. Due to the non-compliance of the

condition,          Crl.M.P.No.1799/2010  was     dismissed.

Consequently, the appeal was also dismissed by the order

under challenge.

      3. Learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner submits

that the non-compliance of the condition to pay cost within

the specified time was not wilful.      The learned counsel

appearing for the Revision Petitioner before the trial court

has not informed the said direction to pay cost on or before

15/12/2010. Therefore, there was no negligence or latches

on the part of the Revision Petitioner to comply with the

condition. The party cannot be allowed to suffer due to the

carelessness or negligence of the counsel.

      4. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the

first respondent submits that the Revision petitioner was

negligent in defending the case from the very beginning.

The learned counsel pointed out that this Revision petition

CRL.R.P.NO. 737 of 2013        : 4 :


is also filed with a delay of 738 days and the delay petition

was allowed on payment of costs. That apart the Revision

petitioner had been negligent in maintaining the Revision

petitioner from the very beginning of the marriage.

Admittedly, no amount has been paid after the order passed

by the trial court.

      5.     Going by order passed by the trial court, it could

be seen that a substantial amount is due from the Revision

Petitioner to the first respondent towards compensation and

maintenance allowance. Admittedly the Revision petitioner

has not complied with the conditional order passed on the

petition to condone the delay. Therefore, I cannot find fault

with the learned Sessions Judge in dismissing the appeal.

      6. It is true that adjudication of dispute on merits is

always better and more desirable than dismissal of a lis. On

technicalities when substantial justice and technical

considerations are pitted against each other, cause of

substantial justice deserves to be preferred. Therefore,

taking a lenient view, I am of the opinion that one more

CRL.R.P.NO. 737 of 2013         : 5 :


opportunity can be given to the Revision Petitioner to

contest the dispute on merits on the following conditions:

      7. This Revision petition will stand allowed on the

following conditions, failing which, needless to say this

order will stand automatically vacated.




      i) The Revision Petitioner shall pay Rs.5,000/- (rupees

five thousand only) as cost which was ordered to be paid in

Crl.M.P.No.1799/2010 for condoning the delay, within one

month from the date of receipt of this order.

      ii) The Revision Petitioner shall deposit Rs.1,00,000/-

(rupees one lakh) in the trial court within a period of two

months from today towards arrears of maintenance to be

paid to the first respondent by the impugned order passed

by the trial court.

      iii)If the Revision Petitioner complies with the above

directions, the order under challenge passed in Crl.Appeal

No.200/201 will stand set aside and then the learned

Sessions Judge shall take the appeal on files, proceed in

CRL.R.P.NO. 737 of 2013        : 6 :


accordance with law and pass appropriate orders afresh on

merits.

      iv)If the Revision Petitioner deposits the      amount

ordered above, the same shall be given to the first

respondent towards maintenance of arrears.

      v) If any warrant is pending against the Revision

Petitioner, the same shall be kept in abeyance till

11/6/2013.

      vi) The execution of the order passed by the trial court

shall be kept in abeyance till disposal of the appeal provided

that the Revision Petitioner continues to pay monthly

maintenance allowance as ordered by the trial court.

      vii) The learned Sessions Judge is directed to dispose

of the appeal within a period of six months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this order.

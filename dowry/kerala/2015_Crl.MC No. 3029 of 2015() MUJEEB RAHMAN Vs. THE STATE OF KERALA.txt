                Crl.M.C. No.3029 of 2015
            --------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of May 2015

                           O R D E R

          Petition filed under Sec.482 Cr.P.C.

          2. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the 2nd

respondent. The 2nd petitioner is his mother and other

petitioners are his close relatives. The petitioners are

accused in C.C. No.2594 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial

1st Class Magistrate Court, Chittur. The prosecution

allegation is that they subjected the 2nd respondent to

cruelty demanding more dowry and thus committed the

offence under Secs.498A read with Sec.34 of Indian Penal

Code. It is submitted that the dispute between the parties

has been settled. The request is to quash the proceedings

in the criminal case.

          3.    Heard     the     learned     counsel    for the

petitioners, the 2nd respondent and the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The 2nd respondent has filed an affidavit to

the effect that the dispute has been settled and she has

no objection to the proceedings in the criminal case being

Crl.M.C. No.3029 of 2015  2

quashed. I am satisfied that the allegation is true. No

public interest is involved in this case. This is a fit case to

invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Sec.482

Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings in the criminal case.

           In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The

proceedings in C.C. No.2594 of 2013 on the file of the

Judicial 1st Class Magistrate Court, Chittur are quashed.

                     B.A.No.4071 OF 2013 ()
                     --------------------------------
              Dated this the 10th day of July, 2013

                              O R D E R
                             ~~~~~~~

      Petitioners are two among the accused in Crime No. 332 of

2013 of Chelakkara Police Station registered for offences punishable

under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 and 8 of

Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. They have

filed the above application seeking pre-arrest bail under Section 438

of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code').

      2.    Above crime was registered on a complaint filed before

the Magistrate by the wife of first accused alleging that the accused

persons, five in number, her husband and his close relatives, ill-

treated and harassed her demanding dowry, and, 4th and 5th accused,

both of them, sexually abused her two minor female children. She

also alleged of sexual harassment against her by the 4th and 5th

accused, who are the present petitioners. Crime registered on her

complaint is now under investigation.

      3.    Petitioners after unsuccessfully moving an application

with other accused for anticipatory bail before the Sessions Judge

have come before this Court for the discretionary relief. Learned

counsel for petitioners relying on some Annexures produced with the

B.A.No.4071/2013                    2


petition contended that petitioners have been falsely implicated in the

crime on baseless allegations. It was only after the first accused, her

husband, commenced proceeding before the family court against the

de facto complainant, wife, she came up with the false complaint

imputing grave allegations against petitioners, is the submission of

counsel.     Learned Public Prosecutor opposing the application

submitted that the materials gathered by investigating agency, prima

facie, disclose complicity of petitioners in having sexually abused the

minor children of de facto complainant. When that be so, this is not a

fit case where petitioners can be extended the discretionary relief

canvassed of, is the submission of learned Public Prosecutor.

      4.    Case Diary has been produced for my perusal.          After

looking into the Case Diary and taking note of the materials gathered

by investigating agency, which contain statements recorded from the

minor children, one of them aged 15 years, supporting the allegations

raised by her mother, de facto complainant, over the sexual abuse

made against them, I find this is not a fit case where petitioners can

be granted anticipatory bail. I make it clear that I am not making any

observation over the merit of the allegations imputed nor on the

veracity of statements purported to have been recorded from the

minor children, but, only, stating that in the given facts of the case

petitioners are not entitled to pre-arrest bail.    Petitioners have to

B.A.No.4071/2013                   3


appear before the investigating officer and co-operate with the

investigation of the crime.

     5.     At this stage, learned counsel for petitioners requested for

providing an opportunity to petitioners to surrender before the

investigating officer, fixing date and time to do so by order of this

Court. Considering the request of counsel, the following directions are

issued while declining pre-arrest bail.

     In case petitioners surrender before investigating officer at

10.a.m. on 15.7.2013, after their interrogation, in the event of their

arrest in the crime, they shall be produced before the Sessions Judge

of competent jurisdiction without delay.         On such production,

application for bail, if any, moved by petitioners with advance notice

to Assistant Public Prosecutor, shall be considered by the Sessions

Judge, expeditiously, and disposed on its merits in accordance with

law.

     Petition is disposed of as above.

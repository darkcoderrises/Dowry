                   CRL. M.C. No.7343 of 2014
            ...............................................................
             Dated this the 9th day of February, 2015

      Petitioners are A1 to A3 in Crime No.739/13 of the

Iravipuram Police Station, registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 323, 324 and 498A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

      2.    Petitioners have come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-I F.I.R. and

Annexure-2 Final Report in Crime No.739/13 of the

Iravipuram Police Station and all further proceedings

pursuant thereto in C.C.1050/2013 on the file of the Judicial

First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kollam, quashed.

      3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

CRL.M.C.No.7343 of 2014
                              -: 2 :-



the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled through a mediation settlement

agreement and presently the defacto complainant has no

complaints against the petitioners and, therefore, the

proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed. The

defacto complainant has entered appearance through her

counsel.

      6.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

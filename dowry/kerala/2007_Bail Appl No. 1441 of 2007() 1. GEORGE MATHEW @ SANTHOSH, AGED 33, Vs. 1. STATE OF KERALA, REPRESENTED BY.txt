                           B.A. No. 1441 OF 2007 A

                   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````

                  Dated this the 13th day of March, 2007


                                     O R D E R




              Petitioner, who is the accused in Crime No.10/07 of Chittar


Police   Station  for  offences  punishable  under  sections  452, 506(ii) and


294(b) IPC, seeks anticipatory bail.


       2.     Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application.


       3.     The case of the prosecution is that the accused married the


second daughter of the de facto complainant on 19.8.2006, at the time


of marriage Rs.5 lakhs and 64 sovereigns of gold ornaments were given


and  the  wife  of  the  petitioner   is   employed in  Saudi  Arabia   as  a  nurse


and the petitioner, who had come down to his native place, trespassed


into the house of his widowed mother-in-law by 12 noon on 24.1.2007


and   demanded   more   dowry   by   putting   her   under   fear   of   death   by


showing a knife and abusing her in filthy language.


       4.     Eventhough anticipatory bail cannot be granted in a case of


this nature, I am inclined to permit the petitioner to surrender before the


Investigating Officer for interrogation and then to have his application for


regular bail considered by the Magistrate concerned.   Accordingly, the


petitioner is directed to surrender before the Investigating Officer on any


day between 20.3.2007 and 23.3.2007 for the purpose of interrogation.

                                            : 2 :




The petitioner shall, thereafter, be produced on the same day before the


concerned   Magistrate,   who   shall   consider   and   dispose   of   the


application,   if   any,   filed   by   the   petitioner   for   regular   bail   on   merits,


preferably on the same date on which it is filed.





        This application is disposed of as above.





                                                           (V. RAMKUMAR, JUDGE)

               ====================
                CRL.M.C. No.1096 of 2015
              =====================
            Dated this the 24th day of March, 2015

                         O R D E R


     Petitioner is accused in Crime No.639 of 2013 of the

Perambra Police Station, Kozhikode District, registered for

the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     2. Petitioner has come up with this Crl.M.C. under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 First Information

Report and Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.639 of

2013 of the Perambra Police Station, Kozhikode District,

and all further proceedings based on it in C.C.No.1169 of

2014 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's

Court-I, Perambra, quashed.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

CRL.M.C.No.1096 of 2015       -: 2 :-


has tortured and harassed the defacto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Section 498A IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      4.    Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.    According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioner and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioner may be

quashed.

      6.    The defacto complainant, who is the 2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioner have been

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner, and, hence, all further proceedings in

the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

CRL.M.C.No.1096 of 2015        -: 3 :-


entered appearance through her counsel.           The learned

counsel for the defacto complainant also endorses the fact

that the affidavit has been sworn in by the defacto

complainant on her own volition.

      7.    When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

First Information Report and Annexure-A2 Final Report in

Crime No.639 of 2013 of the Perambra Police Station,

Kozhikode District, and all further proceedings based on it in

C.C.No.1169 of 2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Perambra are hereby quashed.

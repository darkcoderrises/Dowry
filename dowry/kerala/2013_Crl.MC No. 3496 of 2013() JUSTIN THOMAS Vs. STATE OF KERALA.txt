        --------------------------------------------------
               Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013
        --------------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 20th day of August, 2013


                          O R D E R

     The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in

C.C.No.1534/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Ettumanoor, which is a case instituted upon the

police report in Crime No. 1044/2011 of Ettumanoor

Police Station for the offence punishable under Section

420 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure-A2 charge

sheet and all further proceedings in CC No.1534/2012 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Ettumanoor,

as the matter is settled out of court.

     2.   The allegation in the above case is that the

petitioner/accused with dishonest intention to make

unlawful gain, the 2nd respondent, who is the de facto

complainant, made to believe that the accused would

Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013

                               ..2..

arrange a visa/work permit in England and received an

amount of  2,00,000/-, which was deposited by the 2nd

respondent         in    the account  maintained   by   the

petitioner/accused. Similarly, the accused received a sum

of  3,00,000/- and  2,00,000/- from respondents 3 and 4

respectively, by adopting the same modus operandi. But,

the petitioner has not arranged visa as offered and never

returned the money. Thus, according to the prosecution,

the petitioner has committed the offences punishable

under Section 420 of I.P.C.         The present case of the

petitioner is that the amount so received from the 2nd

respondent/de facto complainant and respondents 3 and 4

were repaid and thus, the entire dispute is settled

between them amicably. Accordingly, respondents 2 to 4

had sworn into Annexures A-3 to A-5 affidavits.

       3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as respondents 2 to 4. I have also heard the learned

Public Prosecutor.

       4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013

                              ..3..

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which

is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is

abuse of process of law and proceedings.

       5. The learned counsel for respondents 2 to 4, who

on the basis of specific instruction received from the

respondents submitted that the above respondents, who

are the de facto complainants, do not intend to proceed

any further against the petitioner and they have no

grievance against him.

       6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents

and materials produced along with the above petition. In

the given facts and circumstances of the case and

especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor

has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

       7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013

                                    ..4..

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Section 420 of

I.P.C., which is more or less personal in nature and no

public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offence is involved, the real parties to the

dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter.        From the submission made by the

counsel for respondents 2 to 4, it appears to me that the

de facto complainants have no further grievance against

the petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note

the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108(SC)].

In which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

              "57.    The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High
      Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
      exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different
      from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the
      offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
      in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
      of any Court.     In what cases power to quash the criminal
      proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
      offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on

Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013

                                      ..5..

      the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can
      be prescribed.."


It is further held as follows:-

       "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
       dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
       purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
       commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
       transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating
       to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is
       basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
       resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High
       Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of
       the compromise between the offender and victim, the
       possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
       criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
       prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
       quashing the criminal case despite           full and complete
       settlement and compromise with the victim........"


       According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances            involved     in   the    present     case    and

particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is

applicable in the present case. Thus, I am of the view

that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues

amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event

of proceeding with the trial, there would not have any

Crl. M.C. No. 3496 of 2013

                               ..6..

fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings.          Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed

granting the relief as sought for.

       In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure-A2 charge sheet and all further proceedings

pending against the petitioner in C.C.No. 1534 of 2012 of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor.

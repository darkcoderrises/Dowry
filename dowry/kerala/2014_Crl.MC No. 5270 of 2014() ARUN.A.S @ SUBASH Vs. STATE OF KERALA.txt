                             V.K.MOHANAN, J
                   ===========================
                         Crl.M.C No.5270 of 2014
                   ============================
                Dated this the 19th day of September,2014

                                   ORDER


           The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the petitioners, who

are accused in C.P.No.102/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Neyyattinkara, which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No.920/2010 of Neyyattinkara Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 366(A) and 376 r/w Section 34 of I.P.C. with a

prayer to quash all proceedings in C.P No.102/2011 pending on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Neyyattinkara as against the

petitioners as the matter is settled out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that 1st accused promised

the 2nd respondent to marry and thereby accused 2 and 3 helped the 1st

accused to remove the 2nd respondent from the lawful custody of her parents

and 1st accused committed sexual intercourse with the 2nd respondent and

thereby the accused have committed the aforesaid offences and now, the

Crl.M.C No.5270 of 2014
                                       2

case of the petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the 2nd

respondent. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the

parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case.

Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received    from the respondent, submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioners and she has no grievance against them.

          6.   The learned counsel for the petitioners and the 2nd respondent

submitted that pursuant to the settlement arrived between the first accused and

2nd respondent, they have married as per the customary rites on 31.12.2013 and

now they are residing together and a child is born in the said wedlock.

Annexure-III is the Marriage Certificate dated 31.12.2013 issued by the

Perumkadavila Grama Panchayat. Thus, it can be seen that on the basis of the

Crl.M.C No.5270 of 2014
                                        3

settlement arrived, 1st petitioner as well as the contesting respondent have

married each other and now they are living together as husband and wife and

leading a peaceful family life and a child has already born in the wedlock. If that

be so, it is only just and proper to allow the prayer in this Crl.M.C otherwise the

continuation of the criminal proceedings will adversely affect their smooth

family life and the pending criminal proceedings certainly would amount to

abuse of process of law. Therefore, it is just and proper to allow this Crl.M.C.

           7. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in

the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the learned

Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

           8. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case, it

can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are under Sections

366(A) and 376 r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, which are more or less

personal in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to note that

though such offences are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

Crl.M.C No.5270 of 2014
                                             4

counsel for the 2nd respondent, it appears to me that the de facto complainant has

no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in the light of the settlement

arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                     "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can
           be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a
           criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent
           jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a
           criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the Code.
           Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it
           has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
           power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of
           the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal
           proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the
           facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be
           prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
           dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes
           of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,
           financial,mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or
           the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
           family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in
           nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
           category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in
           its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim,
           the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
           criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice
           and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
           criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise
           with the victim........"

Crl.M.C No.5270 of 2014
                                        5

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the present case,

the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case. Thus, I

am of the view that as the parties to the dispute settled the issues amicably, it is

the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that since

the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial, there

would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused,

rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of process of

the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited

supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all further proceedings

pending against the petitioners in C.P.No. 102/2011 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Neyyattinkara in Crime No.920/2010 of Neyyattinkara Police

Station.

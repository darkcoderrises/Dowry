              ===========================
                      B.A No. 5842 of 2014
              ============================
              Dated this the 7th day of August, 2014

                             ORDER


     Petitioner, who is the accused in Crime No. 1098/2014 of

Panangad Police Station, apprehending arrest in the above crime

preffered the above application for anticipatory bail under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. The prosecution allegation is that the marriage between

the petitioner and de facto complainant was solomnized on

10.11.2013 and while the de facto complainant was residing in her

matrimonial home she was subjected to harassment both mentally

and physically demanding more dowry and, thus, the petitioner has

committed the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 323

of the Indian Penal Code.

B.A No.5842/2014                    2



       3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

learned Public Prosecutor.

       4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

petitioner is working as a sailor in Indian Navy whereas the de

facto complainant is working as a nurse and, according to her, she

wants to go abroad to take job for which the petitioner was not

amenable and, thus, the present case is foisted against the

petitioner at the instance of the de facto complainant.

       5. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that there is no

specific allegation against the petitioner and the allegations are

general in nature.

       6. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, I am of the view that this petition can be allowed subject

to conditions.

       In the result, this petition is allowed and, accordingly, there

will be a direction that in the event of the arrest of the petitioner in

B.A No.5842/2014                   3



Crime No.1098/2014 of Panangad Police Station, he shall be

released on bail on his executing a bond for `35,000/- (Rupees

Thirty Five Thousand only) with two solvent sureties, each for like

amount, to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer in the above

crime and on the following further conditions:

                second Saturday.

                investigation.

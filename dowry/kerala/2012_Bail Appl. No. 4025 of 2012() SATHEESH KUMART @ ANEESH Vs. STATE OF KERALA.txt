                    B.A. No. 4025 OF 2012

          Dated this the 26th day of June, 2012

                              O R D E R


     The petitioner is the first accused in Crime No.122/2012

of    Cheemeni Police Station, Kasaragod District.              The

offences alleged against him are under sections 498A and

306 r/w 34 of IPC. The petitioner has been in custody from

30.05.2012.

     2.   The wife of the petitioner herein committed

suicide on 09.04.2012. The prosecution contends that the

commission of offence under section 304B has also been

disclosed during investigation. The learned counsel for the

petitioner submits that the allegation that the petitioner and

his parents had compelled or demanded the deceased to get

the immovable property, standing in the name of his father

assigned in the name of petitioner, is absolutely untrue. It is

also stated that there is no material to show that the wife of

B.A.No.4025/2012               -2-


the petitioner committed suicide due to any harassment or

any other sort of cruelty, physical or mental.

     3.   The learned Public Prosecutor submits that there is

sufficient material to show that the petitioner's wife

committed suicide by hanging because of the frequent

harassment of her husband (petitioner) for more dowry. It is

also stated that there was sexual harassment by the father

of the petitioner. There is a property measuring 4.5 acres

and also another item standing in the name of the mother of

the deceased. The petitioner demanded those properties to

be transferred in the name of petitioner. That also is stated

to be one of the reasons. It is stated that the father of the

petitioner herein had outraged the modesty of the deceased

on many occasions.

     3.   Considering the period of detention already

undergone by the accused and in view of the submission

made on behalf of the accused that he will abide by any

condition that may be imposed on him, the accused is

B.A.No.4025/2012               -3-


granted bail with effect from 02.07.2012 subject to the

following conditions:

         (i)   The accused shall execute a bond for

         Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only)

         with two solvent sureties each for the like

         sum to the satisfaction of the concerned

         Court. If in case the Magistrate has any

         doubt     about    the    genuineness    or

         correctness of the tax receipts produced

         by the sureties, the learned Magistrate can

         insist for production of the attested photo

         copies of the original title deeds of the

         sureties.

         (ii)  The accused shall      make    himself

         available    for   interrogation   by   the

         Investigating Officer and that he should

         appear before the Investigating Officer on

         all Mondays and Fridays between 9.30 AM

         to 11.30 AM until further orders.

         (iii) The accused shall produce his original

         passport before the learned Magistrate. If

         he is not having any valid passport, he

         should file an affidavit regarding the same

         before the Magistrate.

B.A.No.4025/2012              -4-


         (iv) The accused will also file an affidavit

         that he will abide by all the conditions as

         mentioned above and that he will not

         commit any offence similar to the offence

         involved in this case and that he shall not

         directly    or   indirectly    make     any

         inducement, threat or promise to any

         person acquainted with the facts of the

         case so as to dissuade him from disclosing

         such facts to the court or to any police

         officer or tamper with the evidence.

         (v)  The accused shall not leave the State

         of Kerala without the prior permission of

         the learned Magistrate.

         (vi) The learned     Magistrate    will also

         ensure the identity of the sureties by

         insisting production of electoral photo

         identity cards/Driving licence etc.

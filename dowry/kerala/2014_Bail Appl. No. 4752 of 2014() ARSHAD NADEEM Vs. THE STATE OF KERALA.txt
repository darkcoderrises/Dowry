                  .................................................
                        B.A.No.4752 of 2014
                  ..................................................
              Dated this the 27th day of June, 2014.

                               O R D E R


      This is an application for anticipatory bail filed by the

first accused in Crime No.168/2014 of Adhur Police Station

under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

      2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell was that the

first accused married the defacto complainant on 27.7.2004 and

thereafter they were living together as husband and wife.

While so, she was ill treated by all the accused by demanding

dowry and also beaten her with deadly weapon and thereby all

of them have committed the offences punishable under Sections

498 A, 294(b) and 324 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that                    the

petitioner has been falsely implicated in the case. In fact the

marriage has taken place in the year                    2004 and there was no

complaint till 2014 for the defacto complainant regarding any ill

treatment and further no document has been produced to show

that she had sustained any injuries as well. There are three

children born to them in the wedlock and two of them were

B.A.No.4752 of 2014               2

with the        petitioner.  The Sessions   court has     granted

anticipatory bail to the other accused persons and the reason

stated by the learned Sessions Judge for denying anticipatory

bail to the petitioner is unsustainable in law. So according to

the counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner is also entitled to

get anticipatory bail.

       4. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor

on the ground that investigation is not over.

       5. Heard both sides and perused the records.

       6. It is seen from the records that the above crime was

registered on the       basis of a private complaint filed by the

defacto complainant before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-I, Kasaragod against the petitioner and other accused

persons      alleging   commission of the offence under Sections

498A, 324 and 294(b) of the Indian Penal Code which was

forwarded to the police for investigation by the Magistrate

under Section 156(3) of the Code. It is also seen from the

documents produced that the petitioner along with the other

accused persons moved the Sessions Court for anticipatory bail

and as per Annexure-A1 order, the learned Sessions Judge

granted anticipatory bail to the other accused persons and

rejected the application for anticipatory bail in respect of the

B.A.No.4752 of 2014                3

petitioner.      Unfortunately, nothing has been mentioned in the

order for rejecting the anticipatory bail to the petitioner while

granting anticipatory bail to the other accused persons. Even

in the order of the Sessions Judge, it was mentioned that though

the offence under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code was

alleged, no wound certificate has been produced as well. It is

also mentioned in the order that no custodial interrogation is

required as well. So, under the circumstances and also

considering the fact that it is a matrimonial dispute and putting

the     husband behind the bar will affect the possibility of

settlement in future, this Court feels that pre arrest bail can be

granted      to the petitioner also with stringent conditions. So

the application is allowed with the following conditions.

       i. If the petitioner is arrested in connection with Crime

No.168/2014 of Adhur Police station, then the petitioner shall

be released on bail on executing a bond for Rs.25,000/- with

two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of

the arresting officer/investigating officer as the case may be.

       ii. The petitioner shall appear before the investigating

officer for the purpose of interrogation for two consecutive days

between 9 a.m and 12 noon immediately after his arrest and

release and thereafter as and when required for this purpose till

B.A.No.4752 of 2014                  4

the final report is filed.

       iii. The petitioner shall appear before the investigating

officer on the last Saturday of every month between 9 a.m

and 10 a.m till the final report is filed for a period of three

months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier.

       iv. The petitioner shall not intimidate or influence the

witnesses.

       v. The petitioner shall surrender his passport before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod within one

week from today and if he is not having any passport, file an

affidavit to that effect within time.

       vi. The petitioner shall not leave India without getting

prior permission from the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-

I, Kasaragod till the disposal of the case.

       v. If the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod and moves for regular bail,

the learned Magistrate is directed to release the petitioner on

bail on the same conditions as stated above.

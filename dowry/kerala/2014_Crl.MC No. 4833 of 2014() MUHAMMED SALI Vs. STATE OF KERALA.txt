                 Crl.M.C.No.4833 of 2014
                  -------------------------------
        Dated this the 25th day of August, 2014.


                          O R D E R

     The petitioners are accused nos.3 and 4 in Crime

No.118/05 of Perinthalmanna Police Station and they

preferred this petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. with a

prayer to quash all further proceedings pending against

them in L.P.No.44/14 in C.C.No.382/09 in the above crime,

on the file of the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-II,

Perinthalmanna, since the other accused in the very same

crime, who faced the prosecution, had been acquitted as

per Annexure-II judgment.

     2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor.

     3. The prosecution allegation is that the first accused

married PW1 on 8.3.1998 as per the rites and ceremonies

prevailing in the Muslim community and resided together

Crl.M.C.No.4833 of 2014
                               2

as husband and wife along with A2 to 5 who are the

mother, brothers and sister respectively of A1. According

to the prosecution, at the time of marriage, gold ornaments

of 20 sovereign and a sum of Rs.35,000/- were given to

PW1 by her family members and A1 and 4 appropriated

those ornaments and amount for their own personal use

and thereupon A1 to A5 in furtherance of their common

intention subjected PW1 with cruelty with a demand of

more dowry and ornaments and also saying that the first

accused would get another wife with more dowry and

ornaments. Thus according to the prosecution, the accused

altogether 5 in numbers have committed the offences

punishable under section 498 A r/w 34 of IPC.

      4. In the light of the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioners, I have carefully gone through

Annexure-II judgment.      Thus towards the last portion of

paragraph 8, the learned Magistrate has found that, "Her

main allegation is with regard to ill treatment by the first

accused. So, the version of PW1 is not at all sufficient to

Crl.M.C.No.4833 of 2014
                               3

prove the prosecution case that A5 ill treated PW1 along

with other accused."       Similarly in paragraph 9 of the

judgment, it is found that, "The version of PW2 also reveal

ill treatment by the first accused alone. Whether there was

any ill treatment on the part of A5 is not at all deposed by

PW2." It is also observed in paragraph 10 that, "So, the

evidence of PW3 is also discloses ill treatment by A1 alone.

there is no version by PW3 also that he had seen A5

assaulting or ill treating PW1." Similarly, in paragraph 11

the learned Magistrate has observed that, "So, the hearsay

version of PW4 is also not at all sufficient to prove the

prosecution case that A5 herein along with other accused

ill treated PW1." Thus going by the above observation and

finding of the learned Magistrate, it can be seen that all

what stated by the above named prosecution witnesses are

only against A1 and no whisper against accused nos.3 and

4, or against accused no.5. Thus it can be seen that the

substratum of prosecution case is shattered through the

evidence of loyal witness of the prosecution. If that be so,

Crl.M.C.No.4833 of 2014
                                4

even if the petitioners are driven out to face the

prosecution, there would not be any meaningful turn out;

rather the same is likely to result in sheer wastage of

judicial time, which will amounts to abuse of process of

court.      So, interest of justice requires to quash the

proceedings pending against the petitioners.

      In the result, this M.C. is allowed quashing all

proceedings         pending   against   the  petitioners in

L.P.No.44/14 in C.C.No.382/09 on the file of the court of

Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Perinthalmanna.

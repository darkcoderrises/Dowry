           This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioners         are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.3133/2013 of Perumbavoor Police Station registered for

the offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian

Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.3133/2013 of

Perumbavoor Police Station as against the petitioners and

all further proceedings based on it pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Perumbavoor,

quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant and

Crl.M.C.6639/2014
                              : 2 :



treated her with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A

IPC, by demanding more dowry.

      5.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the

learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1st

respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

      6.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      7.     The  defacto   complainant,   who    is  the     1st

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners  and,   therefore,   all   further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

Crl.M.C.6639/2014
                                : 3 :



counsel. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant

also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in

by the defacto complainant on her own volition.

      8.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A2

final report in Crime No.3133/2013 of Perumbavoor Police

Station as against the petitioners and all further proceedings

based on it pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Perumbavoor are hereby quashed.

     This petition is for anticipatory bail.

     2. The alleged offence is under Section 498A of the

Indian Penal Code. According to de facto complainant, he was

harassed by petitioner, who is her husband, demanding dowry.

     3. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that there

was some difference of opinion between the parties and de

facto complainant left the matrimonial home on 22.2.2008.

Marriage was solemnized on 29.8.2007 and within a period of

six months, the parties are separated. De facto complainant

sent a notice stating that the marriage was not consummated.

But, only general allegations are made stating that there was

harassment demanding dowry etc. The allegations are false.

     4. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the

allegation regarding non-consummation of marriage was

there in the statement made by de facto complainant. He has

no objection in granting anticipatory bail to petitioner on

conditions.

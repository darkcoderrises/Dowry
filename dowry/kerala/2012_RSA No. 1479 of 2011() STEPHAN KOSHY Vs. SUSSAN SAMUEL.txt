                            --------------------------------------
                    Dated this the 5th day of March, 2012.

                                      JUDGMENT

      The son and the father, defendants in O.S.No.211 of 1998 of the court of

learned Sub Judge, Mavelikkara are the appellants before me. 1st appellant

married the respondent on 03.11.1994. The betrothel ceremony was held on

24.10.1994. Marital relation between 1st appellant and the respondent went into

trouble. 1st appellant demanded divorce from the respondent. Respondent shot

back, by demanding return of `3,09,000/- with interest. According to her, at the

time of betrothal a sum of `3,00,000/- was entrusted to the appellants as her

share in her family property which appellants are liable to return with interest.



      2.      Appellants denied that there was entrustment of         `3,00,000/-.

According to them, there was no agreement to give share to the         respondent

since respondent's father           had offered job for the 1st appellant.    They

admitted that `50,000/- was given to them towards marriage expenses. That

according to them, is not liable to be returned.



      3.      Trial court dismissed the suit. The reasons for dismissing the suit

are that respondent attempted to file the case as an indigent person but, later it

was revealed that she has sufficient means to pay court fee and hence the

RSA No.1479/2011


                                          2

request   to sue as an indigent person was not allowed.          That conduct      of

respondent would tell upon credibility of her evidence.       Trial court also found

discrepancy in the pleadings and evidence of respondent and non-suited her.



       4.     Respondent took up the matter in appeal. Learned Additional

District Judge, Fast Track (Adhoc), Mavelikkara decided A.S.No.130 of 2005 in

favour of the respondent.       The first appellate   court after considering the

evidence concluded that there is no reason to disbelieve evidence let in by the

respondent and her witnesses.       First appellate court relied on the decision in

Muhammed Davood and another v. Hafsath and another (AIR 2010 Kerala

21) to conclude that in a suit for recovery of money and ornaments handed over

to the bride at the time of marriage, court need not insist on documentary

evidence to prove such transaction and that oral evidence of the bride and her

father getting support broadly from relevant circumstances can be accepted.

Respondent was given a decree as prayed for. Judgment and decree of the first

appellate court are under challenge in this Second Appeal raising by way of

substantial questions of law whether the first appellate court was correct in

accepting the proposition that it could pass a decree without evidence and

factual pleadings when the claim is for return of        partimony, whether      first

appellate court is   correct in   drawing a legal presumption       of existence of

patrimony right when there was lack of evidence to establish the case and

whether the first appellate court is justified in negativing the finding of the trial

court arrived at on a consideration of the evidence on record and that too, in the

absence of reliable evidence?

RSA No.1479/2011


                                             3

       5.     Learned counsel for appellants has contended that plea raised by

the respondent is not in tune with the evidence adduced and that it settled

position of law that no amount of evidence which does not have the backing of

pleadings can be looked into. It is also contended that first appellate court was

not correct    in reversing the finding of trial court which rested on a proper

appreciation of evidence taking into account the discrepancy pointed out by the

appellants. Reliance is place on the decisions in Kashi Nath (Dead) through

LRs. v. Jaganath ((2003) 8 SCC 740) and Ishwar Dutt v. Land Acquisition

Collector and another ((2005) 7 SCC 190). It is further contended that having

regard to the material discrepancy proved in the case and inconsistency with

the pleadings and evidence trial court was not justified in relying on the decision

in Muhammed Davood and another v. Hafsath and another (supra).



       6.     It is not as if the first appellate court is not entitled to appreciate the

evidence and comes on its own conclusion. If on appreciation of evidence first

appellate court finds that the decision of the trial court is wrong, nothing prevents

the first appellate court from deciding the case on the materials on record. Being

the last fact finding court, it is within the power of the first appellate court to

appreciate the facts, evidence and other circumstances.



       7.     According to the respondent, `3,00,000 was paid as her share in

her family property at the time of betrothel on 24.10.1994. Appellants, on the

other hand say that only a sum of `50,000/- was paid and that too, as expenses

for the marriage. Appellants have a further case that no share was fixed for the

RSA No.1479/2011


                                        4

respondent in her family property since respondent's father had offered a job for

the 1st appellant. That, there was payment of `50,000/-by the relatives of the

respondent to the appellants ofcourse according to the appellants, for expenses

for the marriage is admitted by the appellants and it is not very much in dispute

that the said    payment was at the time of betrothel on 24.10.1994.           In

otherwords there was a payment on 24.10.1994, the date of betrothel. Then the

question is whether the said payment was of             `3,00,000/- as share of

respondent in her family property or, as appellants would say, `50,000/- towards

marriage expenses.



       8.    That there is a     practice or custom,      prevailant among    the

community of appellants and respondents of the share of the bride being given

at the time of betrothel also is not very much in dispute as revealed from the

evidence of DW1 (2nd appellant). DW1 would admit that there is a custom of

payment of patrimony for the marriage. He would also say that in connection

with marriage of his daughter, he had given `1,00,000/- (though according to

him, for expenses for the marriage).      A further statement of DW1 which is

relevant in appreciating the evidence is that 1st appellant was suitable enough to

get `25,00,000/- as dowry considering his status and education. Therefore,

what exactly was in the mind of appellants when 1st appellant entered into

marriage proposal with the respondent is very clear;        they were under the

impression that     1st appellant is suitable enough to get a minimum of

`25,00,000/-.

RSA No.1479/2011


                                         5

       9.    According    to   the   respondent,    appellants    had  demanded

`5,00,000/- as share of respondent, that amount was scaled down and it was

fixed at `3,00,000/-. Having regard to the impression DW1, the 2nd appellant had

about the capacity of his son to get patrimony for his bride, claim made by the

respondent that the share of property was fixed as `3,00,000/- is not something

which is basically unbelievable.



       10.   Now the question is whether evidence of respondent regarding

payment of `3,00,000/- could be accepted?          In the plaint, she says that for

paying `3,00,000/-, her father had borrowed `1,00,000/- from his father-in-law,

`1,00,000/- from his brother-in-law and       `1,00,000/- from his brother    thus

making up the sum of `3,00,000/-. PW2, the father of respondent has stated

that he collected `1,00,000/- each from the sister of the mother of respondent

and wife of his brother. They were examined as PWs 3 and 4. They asserted

that they had paid the amount to PW2. In proof, they also produced Exts.A1 to

A8, documents showing that       amounts were withdrawn from the respective

accounts of PWs 3 and 4.



       11.   Yet another discrepancy or contradiction as the learned counsel

puts it, is that while in the plaint it is stated that payment was made at the

house of the elder brother of PW2, in the evidence PW2             has stated that

payment was made        in the presence of Paster Kaithakkal at the        Church

auditorium where the feast was arranged in connection with betrothel.            A

further contradiction learned counsel has pointed out is that as per plaint

RSA No.1479/2011


                                        6

averments, money was handed over by one S.E.Thomas, an elder member of

respondent's family to Mathew, the senior member in the team of appellants

but in evidence PW2 stated that money was handed over by Johny, the elder

member of his family to the said Mathew.



       12.    The discrepancies which learned counsel has pointed out, in my

view are only regarding the manner in which the sum of `3,00,000/- was raised

by the respondent's father or as to who, at which place handed over the amount

to the appellants.  Not that the discrepancies could be discarded as irrelevant

but the question is whether the discrepancy is such that no court could place

reliance on evidence of PWs 1 to 5 and say that no such payment was made. In

that matter, I must bear in mind that payment of `50,000/- is admitted by the

appellants though according to them it was towards expenses for the marriage.

I stated that therefore, the dispute has dwindled down to whether payment

made was of `50,000/-as claimed by the appellants or `3,00,000/- as claimed

by the respondent. In that view of the matter the discrepancy which learned

counsel has pointed out in my view is not sufficient to discard the evidence of

PWs 1 to 5 particularly in the light of Exts.A1 to A8 which the first appellate

court has referred to and discussed.



       13.    Possibility of some discrepancy in the evidence is     also quite

probable. The transaction was on 24.10.1994, suit was filed in the year, 1998

and evidence was recorded still later.    As revealed by the evidence of DW1,

the 2nd appellant I stated that the practice of paying patrimony or share of the

RSA No.1479/2011


                                         7

bride at the time of betrothel is not something which was foreign to the parties.

If the 2nd appellant was of the view that his son, the 1st appellant could get

`25,00,000/- as dowry, it is quite unlikely that on the alleged offer of PW2 to

arrange a job for the 1st appellant, they would have been satisfied with a mere,

`50,000/- towards marriage expense when the 2nd appellant claims to have given

`1,00,000/- in that way for the marriage of his daughter. I must also bear in mind

that the trial court rejected the evidence of respondent as PW1 for the reason

that her version is not creditworthy since she had requested permission to sue as

indigent person but, later it was revealed that she has sufficient means to pay

the court fee. I referred to the discrepancy which the trial court has taken into

account which in the view of first appellate court is not sufficient to reject the

case of respondent. First appellate court being the last fact finding court has

referred to the evidence and come to the conclusion that minor discrepancies do

not in any way affect the version of respondent regarding payment of

`3,00,000/-.



       14.     Had been there documentary evidence for payment of the amount

it would have been better. But having regard to the relationship between the

parties on 24.10.1994, ie. respondent being proposed in marriage to the 1st

appellant and the betrothel being performed, it is not normal for somebody to

obtain document for payment of `3,00,000/- as share of the respondent. In

such situation one has to depend on oral evidence.

                                          8

       15.   Having regard to these aspects I do not find any infirmity in the

decision of the first appellate court which has the touch of reality. Nor am I

inclined to think that any substantial question of law is involved in the matter

requiring admission of the Second Appeal.



       Second Appeal is dismissed.



       All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.

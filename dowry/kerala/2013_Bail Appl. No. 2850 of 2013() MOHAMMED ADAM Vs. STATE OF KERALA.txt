               Dated this the 14th day of June, 2013

                                O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.87/2013

of Eravipuram Police Station registered for the offences

punishable under Sections 498A, 403, 405, 406 and 323

read with Section 34 IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that, they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The

crime has been registered on the basis of a private

complaint filed by the de facto complainant before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kollam, which was

BA.No.2850/2013
                                : 2 :



referred to the police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. It seems

that earlier the de facto complainant had approached the

Family Court, Kollam with a claim under Section 125 Cr.P.C.

and subsequently, the matter was settled. It is subsequent

to that the present complaint was filed. The contents of the

CD reveal that the investigation of this case is practically

over and the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is not

required for the continued investigation of this case. Matters

being so, I am of the view that this is a fit case wherein

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners.

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on

each of them executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty

five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

BA.No.2850/2013
                                : 3 :



            (i)   The petitioners shall report before the
     investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11
     a.m. on all Fridays and Mondays, commencing
     from 21-06-2013 for a period of three months or
     till the filing of the final report in this case,
     whichever is earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with
     the evidence or influence witnesses.

            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves
     available for interrogation as and when required
     by the investigating officer.

            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any
     offence while on bail.


     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

                Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2013
            ----------------------------------------
          Dated this the 28th day of June, 2013

                            ORDER

        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of

the   petitioners,   who    are   accused     Nos.1    &    7    in

C.C.No.784/2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Malappuram      which is a case instituted upon the police report

in Crime No.356/2005 of Kottakkal Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., with a prayer to quash all

further proceedings in C.C.No.784/2010 in Crime No.356/2005

of Kottakkal Police Station on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Malappuram as the matter is settled out of

court.

        2.      The allegation in the above case is that on

29/9/2005 at about 9.45 p.m all accused formed into an

unlawful assembly at Indinoor and committed rioting armed

with deadly weapon and restrained Salam, Shereeef and Ayoob

and beat them with stick and thereby accused committed the

above offences and now, the case of the petitioners is that the

matter is settled out of court.

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2013
                                2

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the respondents. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.          Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

process of law and proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the respondents who on

the basis of specific instruction received from the respondent

submitted that the above respondent, who is the de facto

complainant does not intend to proceed any further against the

petitioners and they has no grievance against them.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions

of the respective counsel. I have verified the documents and

materials produced along with the above petition. In the given

facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the light

of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute,

the learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing

the above petition.

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2013
                                     3

          7.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences involved

in the above case are only Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323,

324 r/w Section 149 of I.P.C., which are more or less personal

in nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real parties to

the dispute approached this Court after having amicably

settled the matter. From the submission made by the counsel

for the respondents, it appears to me that the injured has no

further grievance against the petitioners accused in the light of

the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it is relevant

to note the decision of the Honourable Apex Court reported in

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108(SC)]. In

which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57.   The position that emerges from the

          above discussion can be summarised thus:         the

          power of the High Court in quashing a criminal

          proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its

          inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

          the power given to a criminal court for compounding

          the offences under S.320 of the Code.       Inherent

          power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

          limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with

          the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2013
                                      4

          secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of

          the process of any Court. In what cases power to

          quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.

          may be exercised where the offender and victim

          have settled their dispute would depend on the facts

          and circumstances of each case and no category can

          be prescribed..



It is further held as follows:-


          ".........   But   the   criminal     cases    having

          overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour

          stand on different footing for the purposes of

          quashing, particularly the offences arising from

          commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership

          or such like transactions or the offences arising out

          of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family

          disputes where the wrong is basically private or

          personal in nature and the parties have resolved

          their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High

          Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,

          because of the compromise between the offender

          and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote

          and bleak and continuation of criminal case would

          put accused to great oppression and prejudice and

          extreme injustice would be caused to him by not

          quashing the criminal case despite           full and

          complete settlement and compromise with the

          victim........"

          According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly in

Crl.M.C. No. 1238 of 2013
                                    5

view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum

laid in the above decision is applicable in the present case.

Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the dispute

settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to

promote and encourage such settlement, instead of compelling

the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the

net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me,

following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be

allowed granting the relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

further     proceedings     pending   against  the   petitioners in

C.C.No.784/2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Malappuram         and all further proceedings thereto.

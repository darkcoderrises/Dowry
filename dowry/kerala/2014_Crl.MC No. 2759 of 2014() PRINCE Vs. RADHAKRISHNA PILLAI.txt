    ==============================
                  Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014
    ==============================
         Dated this, the 28th day of May, 2014.




                          O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are

accused Nos.1 and 2 in L.P.No.514/2007 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kollam to quash

the proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482

of Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    It is alleged in the petition that petitioners are

accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.378/03 of Kundara Police

Station alleging offences under Sections 452, 323, 506(ii) read

with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Section 27 of Arms

Act and after investigation, final report was filed against 4

accused persons including petitioners and it was originally

taken on file as C.C.No.1316/03 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, No-II, Kollam. Accused Nos.3 and 4

appeared and after trial, they were acquitted by the learned

magistrate as per judgment dated 30.06.2007 and case

against the present petitioners was split up and refiled as

C.C.No.1011/2007. Since the petitioners did not appear even

Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014      :  2 :

thereafter, the case was transferred to register of long pending

cases and it is now pending as L.P.No.514/2007 before that

court and non-bailable warrants have been issued against the

petitioners.    Now, the matter has been settled between the

injured in this case as well. In view of the settlement and also

in view of the fact that accused Nos.3 and 4 were already

acquitted, no purpose will be served in keeping the case and

no conviction will be possible in such cases. Since some of the

offences are non-compoundable in nature, they cannot file any

application before that court. So, they have no other remedy

except to approach this court seeking the following relief:

            "To quash Annexure 1 final report and all

      further proceedings in L.P.No.514 of 2007 on the file

      of the Judicial Magistrate First Class-II, Kollam by

      allowing this Criminal Miscellaneous Case."



      3.     Respondents 1 and 2 who are the de facto

complainant and injured in the case appeared through Counsel

and submitted that the matter has been settled between the

parties, even the case against the accused Nos.3 and 4 were

also ended in acquittal as settled between the parties and they

have filed affidavits before this court stating these facts.

      4.     The Counsel for the petitioners also submitted that

Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014     : 3 :

in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served by

allowing the case to proceed with.

      5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this court submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners but they were absconding after the

incident and not co-operated with the trial of the case.

      6.     Heard both sides.

      7.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by the first respondent as de facto

complainant, a case was registered as Crime No.378/2003 of

Kundara Police Station against 4 accused persons including the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 452, 323, 506(ii)

read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Section 27 of

Arms Act. It is also an admitted fact that after investigation,

Annexure 1 Final report was filed and it was originally taken on

file as C.C.No.1316/2003 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, No-II, Kollam and since the present

petitioners did not appear, when the case was posted for

evidence, the learned magistrate proceeded against accused

Nos.3 and 4 alone and they were acquitted as per judgment

dated 30.06.2007 which is evident from Annexure II

proceedings paper of the court below.      It is seen from the

Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014      :  4 :

proceedings paper, only respondents 1 and 2 were examined

and since they did not support the case of the prosecution,

examination of other witnesses was dispensed with and they

were acquitted and thereafter, the case against the present

petitioners was split up and refiled as C.C.No.1011/2007 and

since they did not appear, the same was transferred to register

of long pending cases and now pending as L.P.No.514/2007

before that court. Now, the matter has been settled between

the present petitioners, the de facto complainant and injured

who were shown as respondents 1 and 2 in this petition. They

have filed affidavits stating these facts as well. So, considering

the circumstances that the matter has been settled between

the parties and accused Nos.3 and 4 were already acquitted on

the basis of the settlement between the parties after trial and

some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature and

allowing the case to proceed with will not serve any purpose

and conviction in such cases is remote, this court feels that it

is a matter where the power under Section 482 of Code of

Criminal Procedure can be invoked.

      8.     Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh V.

State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as

follows:

Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014        :  5 :

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would   depend     on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.    Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to

Crl.M.C.No.2759 of 2014         :  6 :

      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


      9.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also in view of the settlement, no purpose will be

served by allowing the case to continue as conviction in such

cases will be remote and on account of the settlement, original

relationship between the parties have been restored, this court

feels that the power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure can be invoked to quash the proceedings.

      So, the application is allowed and further proceedings in

L.P.No.514/2007 (Crime No.378/03 of Kundara Police Station)

now pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, No-II,

Kollam as against the petitioners is quashed.

      Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for necessary further action.

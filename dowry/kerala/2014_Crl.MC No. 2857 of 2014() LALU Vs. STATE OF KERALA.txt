             Dated this the 17th day of June, 2014


                                  O R D E R


           Crl.M.C. No. 2857/2014 is filed by 2nd accused in

Crime No.1256/2010 of Kunnikkodu police station, who is

shown as sole accused in S.C. 51/2014 on                              the file of

Assistant        Sessions           Court,           Kottarakkara,            and

Crl.M.C.2858/2014 is filed by the first accused in the same

crime and shown as sole accused in S.C.No.899/2011

pending before the same court, both for quashing the

proceedings on the basis of settlement under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter called 'the

Code').

           2.     The common case of the petitioners in both

the cases was that, there was an incident happened on

22.11.2010 between themselves and the 2nd respondent, in

which 2nd respondent sustained some injuries and on the

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                2

basis of the statement given by the 2nd respondent as

defacto-complainant crime No.1256/2010 of Kunnikkode

police station was registered against the petitioners

alleging offences under Section 341, 294(b), 324, 326 and

308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. After

investigation, final report was filed and it was originally

taken on file as C.P.66/2011 and since the petitioner in Crl.

M.C.2857/2014 did not appear, the case against the first

accused, who is the petitioner in Crl.M.C.2858/2014 alone

was committed to the court of Sessions and it was taken on

file as S.C.899/2011 and made over to Assistant Sessions

Court, Kottarakkara, for disposal and it is pending before

that court. Thereafter the petitioner in Crl.M.C. 2857/2014

also appeared before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-III, Punalur, and case against him was also committed

to the court of sessions and it was taken on file as

S.C.51/2014 and that case was also made over to Assistant

Sessions Court, Kottarakkara, for disposal and both these

cases are now pending before the above said court. Now

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                  3

the matter has been settled between the petitioners in both

the     cases      and    2nd   respondent/defacto-complainant.

According to the petitioners, the incident happened due to

some private dispute which resulted in the registration of

the crime.         Now that has been settled due to the

intervention of mediators and friends. Defacto-complainant

does not want prosecute the petitioners. In view of the

settlement no purpose will be served by proceeding with the

case as well.          Since the offences alleged are non-

compoundable in nature, they could not file an application

before the court below for compounding. The petitioners

have no other remedy, except to approach this court,

seeking the following reliefs:

      Crl.M.C.2857/2014

            "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may
      be   pleased    to   quash  all  further    proceedings    in
      S.C.No.51/2014 pending on the file of the Assistant
      Sessions Court, Kottarakkara, as it is an abuse of process of
      court".

      Crl.M.C.2857/2014

            "It is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may
      be   pleased    to   quash  all  further    proceedings    in
      S.C.No.899/2011 pending on the file of the Assistant

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                 4

      Sessions Court, Kottarakkara, as it is an abuse of process of
      court"

            3.    2nd respondent in both the cases, who is the

defacto-complainant had appeared through counsel and

submitted that, the matter has been settled between the

parties and the issue happened due to some mis-

understanding between himself and the first accused and

now that difference of opinion has been resolved due to the

intervention of mediators and now the relationship has been

restored and he does not want to proceed with the

prosecution. He had also stated that, he had filed separate

affidavits in both these applications stating these facts.

            4.    The counsel for the petitioners in both the

cases submitted that, in view of the settlement, there is no

possibility of any conviction and they are neighbors and on

account of the settlement, relationship has been restored.

So he prayed for allowing the application.

            5.    Learned     Public       Prosecutor,      on     the

instructions as directed by this court, submitted that,

except this case, there is no other case against the

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                  5

petitioners, but grievous hurt has been caused to the

defacto-complainant and is not a matter to be quashed by

invoking Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

            6.    It is an admitted fact that, in the incident

happened on 22.11.2010, between the petitioners in both

the cases and the 2nd respondent, 2nd respondent sustained

severe injuries including fracture to his lower jaw. It is also

an admitted fact that, on the basis of the statement given by

the 2nd respondent, crime No.1256/2010 of Kunnikkode

police station was registered against the petitioners

alleging offences under Section 341, 294(b), 324, 326 and

308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It is

also an admitted fact that, the petitioners were arrested

during crime stage, remanded to custody and after some

time,    they    were      released on  bail. Further,   after

investigation final report was filed before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur, and it was originally

taken on file as C.P.66/2011. Since the 2nd accused did not

appear at that time, the learned magistrate committed the

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                6

case against the first accused alone, who is the petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.2858/2011 to the Court of Sessions and it was

taken on file as S.C.899/2011 and it was made over to the

Assistant Sessions Court, Kottarakkara, for disposal. It is

also an admitted fact that, later 2nd accused who is the

petitioner in Crl.M.C.2857/2014 also appeared and the case

against him was also committed to the court of Sessions,

where it was taken on file as S.C.51/2014 and then made

over to Assistant Sessions Court, Kottarakkara, and both

these cases are pending now before Assistant Sessions

Court, Kottarakkara.        Now the matter has been settled

between the defacto-complainant and the accused persons.

It is seen from the affidavit filed by the defacto-complainant

that, the incident itself happened due to some mis-

understanding between himself and the first accused, who

is the petitioner in Crl.M.C.2858/2014 and now the mis-

understanding has been resolved due to the intervention of

mediators and well-wishers and the relationship has been

restored and he has no grievance against the petitioners

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                7

now. It is true that he sustained a fracture on his jaw,

which is a grievous injury. It is also true that dangerous

weapon like iron rod was also used for the commission of

the crime. But since the matter has been settled between

the parties and it is not a public dispute / public interest

involving case and on account of some difference of opinion

in the conduct of the brick keln the incident happened,

which resulted in the filing of the case etc., which has now

been settled and the harmony has been restored between

the parties. There is no possibility of conviction even if the

case is allowed to continue, neither the defacto-complainant

nor his witnesses will support the case of the prosecution

and conviction in such cases will be remote and allowing

the case to proceed will only amount to wastage of judicial

time alone.

            7.    Further in the decision reported in     Gian

Singh V. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)] the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:

            "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                    8

      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or
      F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
      jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
      given to a criminal court for compounding the offences
      under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
      plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
      exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
      such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
      prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
      cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
      complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
      offender and victim have settled their dispute would
      depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
      and no category can be prescribed. However, before
      exercise of such power, the High Court must have due
      regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous
      and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
      like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
      quashed even though the victim or victim's family and
      the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences
      are not private in nature and have serious impact on
      society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim
      and offender in relation to the offences under special
      statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
      offences committed by public servants while working
      in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for
      quashing    criminal    proceedings    involving    such
      offences.       But    the   criminal    cases    having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
      stand on different footing for the purposes of
      quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or
      such like transactions or the offences arising out of
      matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
      disputes where the wrong is basically private or
      personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
      entire dispute. In this category of case, High Court
      may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because
      of the compromise between the offender and victim,
      the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to
      great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
      would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal
      case despite full and complete settlement and
      compromise with the victim. In other words, the High

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                     9

      Court must consider whether it would be unfair or
      contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the
      criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal
      proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of
      law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends
      of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to
      end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
      affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
      jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

            8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that, it is a private

dispute between the parties, which resulted in the

registration of crime and parties have now settled the

dispute due to the intervention of well-wishers of both

parties and no purpose will be served by allowing the case

to be continue, this court feels that, it is a fit case where the

power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

has to be invoked to quash the proceedings in order to

promote harmony that has been restored between the

neighbours and friends on account of the settlement and

the pendency of this case should not be a hurdle for the

same.

            So the application is allowed and further

Crl. M.C.2857 & 2858 of 2014
                                   10

proceedings in S.C. 51/2014 and S.C.899/2011 (both arose

out of the same crime No.1256/2010 of Kunnikkode police

station) now pending before the Assistant Sessions Court,

Kottarakkara, as against the petitioners are quashed.

            Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court, immediately.

            With the above observation, these criminal

miscellaneous cases are disposed of.

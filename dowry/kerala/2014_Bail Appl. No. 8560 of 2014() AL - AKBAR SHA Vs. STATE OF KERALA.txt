                  ------------------------------------
          B.A. Nos. 8560 of 2014 & 8680 of 2014
           ---------------------------------------------------
           Dated this the 20th day of December 2014


                             O R D E R


           B.A No. 8560 of 2014 was filed by the first accused

and B.A No. 8680 of 2014 was filed by accused Nos.2 to 4 in

Crime No. 1128 of 2014 of Ayiroor Police Station for

Anticipatory Bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code' for short).

     2.    The case of the prosecution in nut shell was that

the first accused married the de facto complainant on

2.12.2013 and thereafter, they were living together as

husband and wife and while so she has been subjected to

cruelty demanding dowry and thereby all of them have

committed the offence punishable under Section 498(A) r/w

34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Heard both sides and perused the records.

     4.    The case was registered on the basis of the

complaint given to the Director General of Police by the de

facto complainant, which was forwarded to the concerned

Police Station through the proper channel and the crime was

registered. The marriage subsisted only for few months and

though the marriage was solemnized in the year 2013, the

B.A. Nos. 8560 of 2014 & 8680 of 2014
                                   2

complaint was filed only in the fag end of this year. I am not

going to the question as to whether the allegations are

sufficient to attract the offence punishable under Section 498

(A) of the Indian Penal Code or not against the petitioners.

However, considering the fact that it is a matrimonial dispute

and considering the nature of allegations, the custodial

interrogations of the petitioners is not required and putting

them behind bar in such cases will affect the possibility of

settlement in future also.        So considering the exceptional

circumstances, this Court feels that anticipatory bail can be

granted to the petitioners in the above case with some

conditions.     So the petitions are allowed with following

conditions:

           1. Petitioners if arrested in connection with

           Crime No. 1128 of 2014 of Ayiroor Police

           Station, they are directed to be released on

           bail on executing a bond for Rs.25,000/-

           (Rupees Twenty five thousand only) with two

           solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

           satisfaction       of      the      arresting

           officer/investigating officer/Station House

           Officer of the concerned Police Station as

           the case may be.

           2.    Petitioners shall appear before the

           Investigating Officer for the purpose of

B.A. Nos. 8560 of 2014 & 8680 of 2014
                                   3

           interrogation for three consecutive days

           between     9.00    a.m   and    12.00   noon.

           Immediately after such arrest and release

           and thereafter, as and when required by him

           in writing to do so, till the final report is

           filed.

           3.    Petitioners shall not leave the State of

           Kerala without getting prior permission from

           the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Varkala, till the disposal of the case and they

           shall surrender their passports either before

           the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Varkala or before the Investigating Officer

           at the time of their arrest and move for

           regular bail.

           4.    If the petitioners surrender before the

           Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

           Varkala, and move for regular bail in above

           two crimes, then the learned Magistrate is

           directed to release the petitioners on bail in

           the above crimes on the same conditions as

           state above.

            With the above conditions, the anticipatory bail

applications are allowed.



                                    K. RAMAKRISHNAN,
                                            Judge

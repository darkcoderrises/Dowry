           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner        is    the      3rd    accused         in  Crime

No.1450/2014 of Nemmara Police Station, Palakkad district,

registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A

and 304B IPC.

     3.    Deceased Saritha was given in marriage to A1

on 13.12.2007. At the time of marriage, she was provided

with 35 sovereigns of gold ornaments and A1 was paid an

amount of `75,000/- as dowry. He had misappropriated the

entire  gold     ornaments          and      money        and      repeatedly

demanded properties from the house of the deceased. She

was severely tortured and harassed by the petitioner, who is

the mother of A1. She was made to work severely at the

BA.572/2015
                               : 2 :



field.  On 16.10.2014 also, she was working at the field

along with A1. After works, when she came back, she was

severely scolded and abused by the petitioner.       As she

could not withstand the harassment, she consumed rat

poison and went to the field, where A1 was working. By the

time, she collapsed and she was taken to the hospital,

where she died on 23.10.2014.

      4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.   The contents of the CD, prima facie, reveal the

complicity of the petitioner. The contents of the CD contains

the statement furnished by the deceased at the hospital,

which clearly speaks volumes against the petitioner. At the

same time, the learned counsel for the petitioner has invited

the attention of this Court to the medical records of the

petitioner which shows that she has been suffering from

renal failure, and under constant medical treatment. She

has been advised to undergo kidney transplantation. I have

BA.572/2015
                                 : 3 :



called for a report from the investigating officer. The

investigating officer has also reported that the petitioner is a

chronic patient suffering from renal failure. On that aspect

alone, I am of the view that anticipatory bail can be granted

to the petitioner.

      6.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for `50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only)

with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and subject to

the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)   The petitioner shall report before the
      investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
      on all Wednesdays and Saturdays commencing from
      04.03.2015 for a period of three months or till the
      filing of the final report in this case, whichever is
      earlier.

            (ii)  The petitioner shall not tamper with the
      evidence or influence witnesses.

BA.572/2015
                                : 4 :



           (iii) The    petitioner   shall   make  herself
     available for interrogation as and when required by
     the investigating officer.

           (iv)  The petitioner shall not involve in any
     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

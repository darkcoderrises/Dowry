                  Crl.M.C. NO. 3493 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 13th day of December, 2012

                              ORDER


           Petitioner is the accused in a pending case on the file

of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, North Paravur.   He is

being prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 498A

of Indian Penal Code, on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of

Police, Binanipuram Police Station. Crime in the above case was

registered on a complaint given by his wife, second respondent,

imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment by the husband,

demanding dowry. Now the spouses have resolved all their

matrimonial disputes and are living together, is the submission

of learned counsel for petitioner, which is endorsed by the

counsel appearing for first respondent.      In the light of the

settlement effected by the parties proceedings initiated against

the petitioner may be terminated exercising the inherent powers

of this court, is the submission jointly made by both counsel. In

Gian Singh V. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] the Apex

Crl.M.C. NO. 3493 of 2012          2


Court has held that in criminal cases where the offences, even if

they are non bailable, arisen from matrimonial disputes or such

from disputes which have a civil flavour, settlement effected by

the parties can be recognized by this court to exercise its

inherent powers to terminate such proceedings. Further more, if

the proceedings are continued that will result only in rupturing

the renewed matrimonial relationship between the parties. I also

take note submission made by the learned Public Prosecutor

after getting instructions from the Investigating Officer that the

spouses are now living together resolving all disputes. In such

circumstances       criminal     proceedings      against      the

petitioner/accused in the aforesaid case are liable to be

terminated.

            Criminal proceedings against the petitioner/accused

in C.C. No.535 of 2011 on the file of Judicial First Class

Magistrate-I, North Paravur, are quashed exercising the inherent

powers of this court, under Section 482 of the Code.

            Crl.M.C. is disposed of.


                               S.S.SATHEESACHANDRAN
                                       JUDGE.

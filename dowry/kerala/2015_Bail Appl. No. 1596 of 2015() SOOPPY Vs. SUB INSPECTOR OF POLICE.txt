                      B.A. No.1596 OF 2015
           ...............................................................
             Dated this the 26th day of March, 2015

                                  O R D E R


     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner         is     the       2nd      accused          in Crime

No.114/2015 of the Kuttiadi Police Station, Kozhikode

registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A,

506(i) and 354 of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioner and the other

accused is that they have tortured and harassed the defacto

complainant, who is the wife of the first respondent and

treated her with cruelty by demanding more dowry, after

misappropriating her entire gold ornaments and money. It is

B.A.No. 1596 of 2015
                                -: 2 :-



also alleged that the 2nd accused had made certain sexual

overtures towards the defacto complainant and once he had

caught hold of her hand and caressed her hair.

      4.     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

      5.      It seems that the investigation of this case is

practically over. No criminal antecedents have been reported

against the petitioner. Considering the trivial nature of the

allegations against the petitioner, I am of the view that

anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner.

      6.     In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioner, is directed to enlarge

the petitioner on bail in the event of his arrest on his

executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty five

thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like

sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest, and

subject to the following terms and conditions:-

B.A.No. 1596 of 2015
                                -: 3 :-



             (i)    The petitioner shall report before the

       investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

       a.m. on all Thursdays and Mondays commencing

       from 02.04.2015 for a period of three months or

       till the filing of the final report in this case,

       whichever is earlier.

             (ii)   The petitioner shall not tamper with

       the evidence or influence witnesses.

             (iii)  The petitioner shall make himself

       available for interrogation as and when required

       by the investigating officer.

             (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any

       offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

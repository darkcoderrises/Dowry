                    B.A. No.2620 of 2014
                    ------------------------------
            Dated this the 2nd day of June 2014


                            O R D E R


     Petitioner is the 2nd accused in Crime No.144/2014 of

Pulpalli Police Station, Wayanad District.          The offences

alleged against her and other accused are punishable under

Secs.405, 406, 498A and 306 r/w 34 of IPC. Apprehending

arrest, this petition is filed for anticipatory bail.

     2.   First accused is the husband of Shanti, who

committed suicide on 5.3.2014 by jumping down from a flat

at Dubai. The crime was registered based on a complaint

given by the father of the victim. 2nd accused is the mother

of the first accused. The victim was married by the first

accused on 14.5.2007. It is stated that the gold ornaments

worth 35 sovereigns were given to the victim at the time of

marriage. That was taken away by the first accused and

appropriated the same. In the relationship between the first

B.A. No.2620 of 2014

                             -: 2 :-

accused and the victim woman, two children were born.

The eldest being aged 5 years and other child is aged 1=

years. It is alleged that the petitioners subjected the victim

to physical and mental cruelty. The victim was working in

Delhi.   When she became pregnant, she came back and

started residing in the house of her husband. Petitioners

started harassing her. Thereafter when she went to Dubai,

from there both accused subjected her to physical and

mental cruelty. The allegation is that they used to comment

that she was not having that much beauty and that the

dowry brought from her parents was very less. The crime

was registered alleging commission of offences under

Secs.304B, 306, 406 and 498A r/w 34 of IPC.

Since the suicide was within a period of 7 years from the

date of marriage, the presumption under Sec.113A and

113B of Evidence Act would also be available, the learned

Public Prosecutor submits.

     3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

B.A. No.2620 of 2014

                             -: 3 :-

the first accused was employed in a company.          He was

terminated from service just four days prior to the incident.

It was because of that mental agony, she committed suicide

by jumping from the flat, the learned counsel submits.

     4.    This submission is strongly resisted by the learned

Public Prosecutor pointing out the statements given by the

mother of the victim and other witnesses. The statement of

the 5 year old boy was also recorded by the police which

would also support the case of the prosecution. Even if the

statement of that boy is eschewed from consideration, still

the statement given by the other witnesses including the

parents of the victim would show the cruel treatment meted

out to the victim, the prosecution points out.

     5.    The de facto complainant (father of the victim) is

also represented by his counsel. Learned counsel for the de

facto complainant submits that a complaint was filed by the

wife of another son of the petitioner herein making similar

allegations. Of course, that complaint was given subsequent

B.A. No.2620 of 2014

                              -: 4 :-

to this crime. But the learned counsel submits that, that

would also sufficiently indicate that the allegations

mentioned in this crime are true.

     6.    This is only an application for anticipatory bail.

The nature and gravity of the offence, possibility of the

accused to flee from justice and the likelihood of her

terrorizing or influencing the witnesses cannot be lost sight

of. She would tamper with the evidence and witnesses and

would     hamper    with   the     smooth investigation,  the

prosecution contends.

           In these circumstances, I am not inclined to grant

pre-arrest bail to the accused.       Hence, the request for

anticipatory bail is rejected. When the accused is produced

before the Magistrate, the learned Magistrate will dispose

of her application for bail without delay.

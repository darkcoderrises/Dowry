                Dated this the 5th day of July, 2013

                                O R D E R
                                ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

           Petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioners         are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.845/2012 of Koipram Police Station registered for the

offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34

IPC.

     3.    The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

is the wife of the first petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

by demanding more dowry.

     4.    Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. The

crime has been registered on the basis of a private

complaint filed by the de facto complainant before the Chief

Judicial Magistrate's Court, Pathanamthitta, which was

BA.No.1043/2013
                                 : 2 :



referred to the police under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.       Apart

from the usual allegations that are being set forth in a case

under Section 498A IPC, no specific overt acts are alleged

against any of the petitioners.        On going through the

contents of the CD, I do not think that the custodial

interrogation of the petitioners is required for the continued

investigation of this case. Being a matrimonial offence, I am

of the view that this is a fit case wherein anticipatory bail can

be granted to the petitioners.

      5.    In the result, this bail application is allowed and

the investigating officer or such other police officer, who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners, is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest on

each of them executing a bond for `25,000/- (Rupees twenty

five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the

like sum to the satisfaction of the officer conducting arrest,

and subject to the following terms and conditions:-

            (i)  The petitioners shall report before the

BA.No.1043/2013
                               : 3 :



     investigating officer in between 9 a.m. and 11

     a.m. on all Fridays and Mondays, commencing

     from 12-07-2013 for a period of three months or

     till the filing of the final report in this case,

     whichever is earlier.


            (ii)  The petitioners shall not tamper with

     the evidence or influence witnesses.


            (iii) The petitioners shall make themselves

     available for interrogation as and when required

     by the investigating officer.


            (iv) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.



     It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation of

bail.

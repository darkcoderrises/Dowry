                             Crl.M.C. No.3788 of 2009
                            --------------------------------------
                      Dated this the 9th day of April, 2013.

                                         ORDER

               Petitioners are accused in C.C.No.197 of 2008 before the Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Wadakkanchery. 1st petitioner along with two other

accused persons (petitioners 2 and 3 herein) was charge sheeted for offence

punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code

(for short, "IPC"). He married the 2nd respondent on 02.02.2004. 2nd respondent

gave a statement to Police on 09.02.2008 alleging cruelty against the petitioner

and two other accused. Allegations of physical torture, demand for dowry, etc.

were made in the first information statement. Pursuant to that, Crime No.97 of

2008 was registered by the Wadakkanchery Police.                   Annexure-A is the first

information report.     After investigation, Annexure-B, final report was filed.

Learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences and issued process.

Subsequently, Annexure-C, charge was framed in the case. Learned counsel for

the petitioners submitted that there was a divorce petition pending before the

Family Court, Thrissur. Petition before the Family Court is Annexure-F. In that

proceedings, 2nd respondent filed Annexure-G, statement agreeing for divorce.

Consequent to that, Annexure-H, judgment was passed by the Family Court,

Thrissur ordering a decree of divorce.            Learned counsel for the petitioners

produced certified copy of the deposition of PW1 (2nd respondent) in C.C.No.197

of 2008. Petitioners 2 and 3, who are arraigned as accused 2 and 3 in the

criminal case, stood a trial. Case against the 1st petitioner was split up due to

his absence.    2nd respondent deposed before the trial court as PW1 and gave

Crl.MC No.3788/2009                       2

evidence to the effect that there was no cruelty meted out to her by any of the

accused. Considering the evidence adduced by the 2nd respondent and other

witnesses, learned Magistrate acquitted accused 2 and 3 in the case, finding that

offence under Section 498 IPC. was not established.

       2.       On a perusal of the records and hearing the learned counsel for

petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor, I am satisfied that continuance of

this proceedings is an exercise in futility. Parties have condoned the marital

offences and decided to sever the relationship. It is submitted that both of them

have been separately married.         Therefore, in the light of the facts and

circumstances and also in the absence of any evidence to attract offence under

Section 498A IPC against the 1st petitioner, I hereby quash Annexure-A, first

information report, Annexure-B, final report and Annexure-C, charge sheet in

C.C.No.197 of 2008 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Wadakkanchery against the 1st petitioner.

       Petition is allowed.

       All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.




                                                 A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.

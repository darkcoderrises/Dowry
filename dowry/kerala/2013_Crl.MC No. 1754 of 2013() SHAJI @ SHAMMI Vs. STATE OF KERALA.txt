                                    O R D E R


     This is an application filed by the petitioners who are accused

numbers 1 to 4 in C.C. No.1997/08 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal, to quash the proceedings under

Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code.

     2.    The case of the petitioners are as follows:

           The petitioners are the accused 1 to 4 in C.C.
     No.997/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-
     II, Attingal for an offfence punishable under Section 498
     (A) & 34 I.P.C. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the
     defacto complainant/2nd respondent.                             2nd and 3rd
     petitioners are the sisters of the 1st petitioner and the 4th
     petitioner is the husband of the 2nd petitioner. The 2nd
     respondent filed C.M.P. No. 358/2008 before the
     Magistrate Court, Attingal against the petitioners for an
     offence punishable under Section                       498A and 34 I.P.C.
     The learned Magistrate forwarded the CMP to the
     Kilimanoor Station House Officer. The police registered
     the Crime.    The prosecution case is that the marriage
     between the defacto complainant and the 1st accused was
     solemnized on 30.05.2002, and at the time of marriage the
     parents of the defacto complainant gifted her 115
     sovereign of gold ornaments and a Maruti 800 Car.
     Thereafter they received Rs.2,30,000/-.                            After the
     marriage, the defacto complainant resided in the
     matrimonial house for 2 months. The accused persons
     demanded more dowry and mentally harassed the defacto
     complainant. Thereby committed the offence. Now the
     matter is settled between the parties. Hence this criminal
     miscellaneous application to quash Annexure-A charge
     sheet.

     3.    At the time of admission, both counsel for the petitioner

and 2nd respondent appeared. Along with the petition, affidavit of

Crl. M.C. No.1754 of 2013
                                   2

the 2nd respondent (though it is stated in the index of the petition that

it is a noterised affidavit but infact it was not so) stating that the

matter has been settled between the parties, and she has no objection

in quashing the proceedings. Learned counsel for the 2nd respondent

also submitted that they have no objection in allowing the petition.

First respondent appeared through Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The case was registered on the basis of a private

complaint filed by the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant, against

the petitioners alleging offence under Section 498 A read with Section

34 I.P.C before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal,

which was forwarded to the police for investigation by the learned

Magistrate, and on that basis, Crime No.127/2008 was registered, and

after investigation, final report was filed for the above said offence

against the petitioners, and the same was taken on file by the learned

Magistrate as C.C. No.997/2008. It is seen from the affidavit filed by

the defacto complainant /2nd respondent that there were other cases

pending between the parties before the Family Court, and against the

Judgment of the Family Court, appeal has been preferred before this

court as Matrimonial Appeal No.374/2011, and the matter has been

settled in the appeal and the matrimonial appeals have been disposed

of on the basis of the compromise petition filed by the parties. It is

also submitted by both counsel for the parties that on the basis of the

Crl. M.C. No.1754 of 2013
                                    3

compromise, they have decided to separate as well and all the

monitory disputes between the parties have been settled.

       The position regarding the power of this court to quash the

proceedings in a non-compoundable offence has been considered by

the Honourable Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012

(4) KLT 108 (SC), wherein it was held that it is within the powers of

the High Court to quash the criminal proceedings involving non-

compoundable offences, on the basis of the compromise reached by

the offender and the victim. It is also observed in the said decision

that compounding of offence under S.320 Cr.P.C and the quashing of

criminal proceedings under S.482 Cr.P.C are different and distinct.

High Court must consider whether it would be unfair and contrary to

the interest of justice to continue with such proceedings in view of the

settlement and the compromise reached between the parties. Further

in the same decision, it has been observed that in the case of

matrimonial disputes, court must always promote the compromise and

if the matter is settled between the spouses, the criminal case

involving non compoundable offences pending between them has to

be quashed, inorder to enable them to settle their disputes amicably.

       So considering the circumstances, that the matter has been

settled between the parties, and it is a matrimonial dispute, I feel that

there is no purpose in allowing the proceedings to continue, and the

Crl. M.C. No.1754 of 2013
                                   4

power under Section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked and the further

proceedings in C.C. No.997/08 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Attingal can be quashed.       So the petition is

allowed and further proceedings in C.C. No.997/2008 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Attingal is hereby quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the court below at the

earliest.

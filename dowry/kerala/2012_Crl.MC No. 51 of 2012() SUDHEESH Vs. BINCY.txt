                 Crl.M.C. NO.51 of 2012
           ----------------------------------------
             Dated this the 12th day of June, 2012

                            ORDER


           Petitioners are the accused in crime No.224/2011,

of Kodencherry Police Station, Kozhikode.       That crime has

been registered on a complaint filed by the first respondent

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Thamarasserry, and

its reference to the Station House Officer for investigation and

report under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.     First petitioner is the husband and second

petitioner is the mother-in-law of the complainant. Both of

them have committed offences punishable under Section

498-A and 406 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, is

the case of the complainant alleging that she was vexed,

harassed and intimidated demanding dowry and all her

valuable gold ornaments are also unlawfully taken by them.

Crime registered against the petitioner for the aforesaid

offences are now under investigation.       At this stage the

Crl.M.C. NO.51 of 2012            2



present petition has been filed contending that petitioners

have amicably       settled  the  disputes   arising  from    the

matrimonial disputes between the first petitioner and their

complainant and therefore Annexure A1 F.I.R. and all

proceedings arising therefrom be quashed invoking the

inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of the Code.

If there is any settlement of the matrimonial disputes, and the

de facto complainant/first respondent is not interested in

prosecuting    further   the  complaint    giving  rise  to   the

registration of the crime it can be brought to the notice of the

investigating officer by the parties. If there is any merit in the

plea canvassed regarding the settlement it can be taken note

of by the investigating officer. On the submissions made that

settlement has been effected, criminal proceedings arising

from Crime No. 224/2011 are not liable to be quashed.

            Crl.M.C. is dismissed.

                                       JUDGE.

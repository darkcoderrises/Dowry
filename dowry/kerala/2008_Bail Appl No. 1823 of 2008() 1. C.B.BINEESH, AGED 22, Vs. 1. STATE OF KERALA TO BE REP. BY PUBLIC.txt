           ````````````````````````````````````````````````````
           Dated this the 24th day of March, 2008

                             O R D E R


           Application for anticipatory bail. Petitioner, a young

man aged about 22 years, faces allegations as the first

accused in a crime registered for offences punishable under

the Dowry Prohibition Act. He was allegedly in love with a girl

elder to him. There was allegedly an agreement between the

young lovers to get married. His parents evidently dissuaded

him from entering such a matrimony. At the eleventh hour he

allegedly backed out from the agreement. Allegations have

been made and crime has been registered against the

petitioner/son and his father.          The allegation is that the

backing out of the petitioner from the agreement to marry is

consequent to disagreement on the amount payable as

dowry.    The father had approached this Court with an

application for anticipatory bail and by order dated 12.3.08 in

BA.1823/08
                              : 2 :


BA.1307/08 he was granted anticipatory bail subject to

conditions. The petitioner now apprehends imminent arrest.

He prays that directions under section 438 Cr.P.C. may be

issued in his favour also.     The    learned counsel for the

petitioner submits that it was not a case of the marriage not

taking place on account of any dispute regarding dowry.

Better counsel appears to have prevailed and the calf love did

not mature into serious matrimony, it is submitted.

      2.   The learned counsel for the petitioner prays, the

learned Public Prosecutor does not oppose the said prayer

and I am satisfied that the petitioner herein can also be

granted anticipatory bail subject to identical conditions as

were imposed on the father of the petitioner.

      3.   In the result, this petition is allowed. Following

directions are issued under Section 438 Cr.P.C in favour of

the petitioner.

      i)   Petitioner shall surrender before the learned

Magistrate having jurisdiction at 11 a.m on 31.3.2008.   He

BA.1823/08
                                : 3 :


shall be released on regular bail on condition that he executes

a bond for Rs.25,000/-(Rupees twenty five thousand only)

with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the

satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.

      ii)   The petitioner shall make himself available for

interrogation before the investigating officer between 10 a.m

and 5 p.m on 1.4.08 and 2.4.2008. During this period, the

investigating officer shall be at liberty to interrogate the

petitioner in custody and take all necessary steps for the

proper conduct of the investigation in this crime. Thereafter,

he shall appear before the investigating officer on all Mondays

between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. for a period of one month and

subsequently as and when directed by the investigating officer

in writing to do so.

      (iii) If the petitioner does not appear before the learned

Magistrate as directed in clause (i), directions issued above

shall thereafter stand revoked and the police shall be at liberty

to arrest the petitioner and deal with him in accordance with

BA.1823/08
                               : 4 :


law, as if these directions were not issued at all.

     (iv) If he were arrested prior to 31.3.2008, he shall be

released from custody on his executing a bond for

Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) without any

sureties, undertaking to appear before the learned Magistrate

on 31.3.2008.

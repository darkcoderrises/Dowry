                ===========================
                      Crl.M.C No.3927 of 2014
                ============================
               Dated this the 25th day of August, 2014

                               ORDER


      Petitioner who is the sole accused in Crime No. 71/2008 of

Venjaramoodu Police Station preffered this petition under Section 482

of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to quash Annexure A1

final report and all further proceedings pending against him in S.C

No.155/2013 of the Court of Sessions, Thiruvananthapuram.

      2. The allegation against the petitioner is that he had kidnapped

the minor daughter of the de facto complainant aged 17 years from his

lawful guardianship on 15.01.2008 while she was going to the school

and thereafter married her by tying the knot and reside along with her

from 15.01.2008 to 13.02.2008 and thus, the petitioner has committed

the offence punishable under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code.

      3. Now, the learned counsel for the petitioner and the additional

third respondent submitted that after the said incident they have

Crl.M.C No.3927/2014

                                     2



married each other as evidenced by Annexure A2 and in that wedlock

they have got two children as evidenced by Annexure A3 and A4.

Now, the de facto complainant, who is the 2nd respondent in the above

Crl.M.C filed an affidavit dated      07.07.2014 stating that the entire

matter is settled and he has no objection in allowing the above petition.

      4. In the light of the above facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the victim and the petitioner married each

other and two children are born in that wedlock and now they are

leading a peaceful marital life and therefore, according to me, the

continuation of the prosecution against the petitioner will adversely

affect their family life and therefore, it is just and proper to allow this

petition. In this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the

Honourable Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012

(4) KLT108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
         High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
         or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given to a

Crl.M.C No.3927/2014

                                        3



           criminal court for compounding the offences under
           S.320 of the Code.        Inherent power is of wide
           plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
           exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
           such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)
           to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what
           cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
           complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where the
           offender and victim have settled their dispute would
           depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
           and no category can be prescribed..




It is further held as follows:-

          "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
          and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
          footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
          offences           arising       from       commercial,
          financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like
          transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
          relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
          wrong is basically private or personal in nature and
          the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
          category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
          between the offender and victim, the possibility of
          conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
          criminal case would put accused to great oppression
          and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to
          him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
          complete      settlement  and   compromise    with   the
          victim........"

      In the result this Crl.M.C is allowed quashing Annexure A1 final

report and all further proceedings in S.C No.155/2013 on the file of

Sessions Court Thiruvananthapuram arising out of Crime No. 71/2008 of

the Venjaramoodu Police Station.

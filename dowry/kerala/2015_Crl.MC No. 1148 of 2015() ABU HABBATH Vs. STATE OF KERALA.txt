          This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   Petitioners         are       the      accused          in  Crime

No.330/2014 of Koduvally Police Station registered for the

offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of the

Indian Penal Code.

     3.   Petitioners have come up with this petition for

getting Annexure-1 FIR in Crime No.330/2014 of Koduvally

Police Station as against the petitioners and all further

proceedings based on it in C.C.1084/2014 pending before

the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery

quashed.

     4.   The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who

Crl.M.C.1148/2015
                               : 2 :



is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with cruelty

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding

more     dowry,   after  misappropriating   her   entire   gold

ornaments and money.

      5.     According to the petitioners, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto

complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,

therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be

quashed.

      6.     The  defacto    complainant,   who   is  the    2nd

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have

been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against     the  petitioners   and,   therefore,   all  further

proceedings in the matter referred to above can be

quashed.       She has entered appearance through her

counsel.

Crl.M.C.1148/2015
                                : 3 :



      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

referred to above.

      In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-1

FIR in Crime No.9330/2014 of Koduvally Police Station as

against the petitioners and all further proceedings based on

it in C.C.1084/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery are hereby quashed.

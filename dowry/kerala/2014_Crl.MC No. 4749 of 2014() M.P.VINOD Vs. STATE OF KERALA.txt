                         Crl.M.C.No. 4749 of 2014
                      ----------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 21st day of August, 2014

                                   O R D E R

                    The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.19/2013 of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam, for the offences punishable under

Section 498A of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash all further proceedings

against the petitioner/accused in C.C.No.19/2013 before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam, pursuant to Annexure I private

complaint and Annexure-II summons as the matter is settled out of court.

         2. The allegation in the above case is that the petitioner/husband

had illtreated the second respondent/the de facto complainant/wife and

physically and mentally harassed her and thereby, the accused has

committed the aforesaid offence and now, the case of the petitioner is that

the matter is settled out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

Crl.M.C.No.4749 of 2014

                                     :-2-:

counsel for the second respondent. I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during the

pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably between the parties

to the dispute which is the subject matter of the above case. Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of process of law and

proceedings.

          5. The learned counsel for the second respondent, who on the basis of

specific instruction received from the respondent submitted that the above

respondent, who is the de facto complainant does not intend to proceed any

further against the petitioner and she has no grievance against him.

          6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the respective

counsel. I have verified the documents and materials produced along with the

above petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially

in the light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in the case,

it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case is only Section 498A

Crl.M.C.No.4749 of 2014

                                              :-3-:

of I.P.C. which is more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offence is involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having amicably settled the

matter. From the submission made by the counsel for the second respondent, it

appears to me that the de facto complainant has no further grievance against the

petitioner/accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them.                       In this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the Honourable Apex Court, in the decision

reported in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and

another [2013 (1) KLD 817(SC)], has held as follows:-


                   "7. It is not in dispute that matrimonial disputes have been on
          considerable increase in recent times resulting in filing of complaints
          under Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C. not only against the husband but
          also against the relatives of the husband. The question is when such
          matters are resolved either by the wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial
          home or by mutual settlement of other pending disputes for which both
          the sides approached the High Court and jointly prayed for quashing of
          the criminal proceedings or the FIR or complaint by the wife under
          Sections 498A and 406 of I.P.C., whether the prayer can be declined on
          the sole ground that since the offences are non-compoundable under
          Section 320 of the Code, it would be impermissible for the court to quash
          the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint.
                   8. It is not in dispute that in the case on hand subsequent to the
          filing of the criminal complaint under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC and
          Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, with the help and
          intervention of family members, friends and well-wishers, the parties
          concerned have amicably settled their differences and executed a
          compromise/settlement. Pursuant thereto, the appellants filed the said
          compromise before the Trial Court with a request to place the same on
          record and to drop the criminal proceedings against the appellants
          herein. It is also not in dispute that in additional to the mutual settlement
          arrived at by the parties, respondent/-wife has also filed an affidavit

Crl.M.C.No.4749 of 2014

                                            :-4-:

         stating that she did not wish to pursue the criminal proceedings against
         the appellants and fully supported the contents of the settlement deed. It
         is the grievance of the appellants that no only the Trial Court rejected
         such prayer of the parties but also the High Court failed toe exercise its
         jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code only on the ground that the
         criminal proceedings relate to the offences punishable under Sections
         498A and 406 of IPC which are non-compoundable in nature."
                  "12. In our view, it is the duty of the Courts to encourage
         genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the same
         are on considerable increase.           Even if the offences are non-
         compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
         satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably and without any
         pressure, we hold that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section
         320 of the Code would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
         of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal proceedings.
                      13. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in
         recent times. The institution of marriage occupies an important place
         and it has an important role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
         should be made in the interest of the individuals in order to enable them
         to settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties ponder over their
         defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement
         instead of fighting it out in a Court of law, in order to do complete justice
         in the matrimonial matters, the Courts should be less hesitant in
         exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite to state that the power
         under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection
         only when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on record, that
         allowing the proceedings to continue would be an abuse of the process of
         the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceedings ought to
         be quashed."


In the present case, the only offence involved is under Section 498A of I.P.C.

The criminal proceedings for the said offence originated from the matrimonial

issues, which are now settled. Consequently, the parties want a quietus to the

criminal case as well.

         According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved

in the present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

Crl.M.C.No.4749 of 2014

                                      :-5-:

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision will be squarely applicable

in the present case. According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote such settlement, instead

of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note that

since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of proceeding with the trial,

there would not have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and abuse of

process of the court and proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the

decisions cited supra, this Crl.M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing           all further

proceedings against the petitioner/accused in C.C.No.19/2013 before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam, pursuant to Annexure I

private complaint and Annexure-II summons.

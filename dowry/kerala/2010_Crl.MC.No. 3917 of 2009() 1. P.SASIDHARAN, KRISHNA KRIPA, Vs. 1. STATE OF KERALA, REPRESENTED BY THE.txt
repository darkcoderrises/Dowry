                             ORDER

     Petitioners in Crl.M.C No.4074 of 2009 are a father and a

son (Sudharshanan and Pradeep). They are accused Nos.1 and 3

in Crime No.427 of 2009 of Poojapura Police Station for offences

punishable under Sections 420, 506(ii) read with 34 IPC and

Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. 1969.       The marriage

between the 2nd petitioner Pradeep and Preethi the daughter of

the de facto complainant was agreed to be solemnised on

30.10.2009.    But the marriage did not take place and on

23.10.2009 the de facto complainant advertised in the

Mathrubhumi daily that the marriage which was fixed to be held

on 30.10.2009 was postponed.          Thereafter, the de facto

complainant lodged Annexure C complaint before the Poojappura

Police alleging the aforesaid offences and the Police registered

the aforesaid crime. After investigation, the Police filed the final

report   before  the   Additional   Chief   Judicial   Magistrate,

Thiruvananthapuram who took cognizance of the offences and

has registered the case as C.C.No.86/2010.         The prayer in

Crl. M.C. Nos.3917 & 4074 / 2009
                                    2



Crl.M.C.No.4074/2009 is to quash Annexure C           F.I.R.  The

prayer in Crl.M.C.No.3917/2009 filed by one Sasidharan (A2)

who is the uncle of one Pradeep (A3) is to quash Annexure C

F.I.R.

       2. The ground put forward for quashing the F.I.R is that on

21.10.2009 there was an agreement executed between the two

fathers as well as the prospective groom whereby the groom's

side had withdrawn from the marriage and had returned the

photographs, horoscope, a C.D. containing the marriage fixing

ceremony, a sample blouse of Preethi etc.

       3. The petitioners would have it that when the marriage

was agreed to be cancelled as per Annexure A agreement to

which both parties affixed their signatures, there was no

question of any cheating and therefore the subsequent complaint

filed by the girl's father and the crime registered were all

unsustainable.

       4. The learned counsel for the de facto complainant would

dispute the agreement and would say that the signatures were

obtained under duress and that every word stated in the

complaint is true. It is a disputed question of fact.

Crl. M.C. Nos.3917 & 4074 / 2009
                                        3



       5. It is too early for this Court sitting in the jurisdiction

under Section 482 Cr.P.C to come to a conclusion either way

regarding the legality or otherwise of Annexure A agreement.

The learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences.

The remedy of the petitioners is to seek for a discharge if

grounds to do so exist.

       Accordingly, without prejudice to the right of the

petitioners to plead for discharge before the Magistrate these

Crl.M.Cs are          dismissed.       In case the petitioners file an

application for personal exemption before the Magistrate for

considering        their      contention of  discharge,  the  learned

Magistrate shall allow the same. The learned Magistrate shall

not insist upon the personal appearance of the petitioner before

the court below for the disposal of the discharge petition.

Dated this the 28th day of June, 2010.


                                              V. RAMKUMAR, JUDGE

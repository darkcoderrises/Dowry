                    ----------------------------------------
                       Crl.M.C.No. 1654 of 2013
                    ----------------------------------------
                 Dated this the 26th day of June, 2013

                                 O R D E R

                   The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance of the

petitioner, who is the second accused in Crime No.96 of 2009 of

Hosdurg Police Station, which is now pending as S.C.No.310 of 2010

on the file of the Principal Sessions Court, Kasaragod for the offences

punishable under Sections 143,147,148,323,307 read with Section

149 of I.P.C. with a prayer to quash Annexure A2 final report and all

further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.96 of 2009 of Hosdurg

Police Station, which is now pending as S.C.No.310 of 2010 on the

file of the Principal Session's Court, Kasaragod as the matter is settled

out of court.

         2.   The allegation in the above case is that on 3.2.2009 at

about 7 p.m. the accused because of their political enmity towards

Crl.M.C.No.1654 of 2013

                                :-2-:

respondents 2 and 3 herein, who are CPI(M) sympathizers, formed

themselves into an unlawful assembly with deadly weapons such as

sword and assaulted respondents 2 and 3 at Pollakada in Pullur

Village and thereby, the accused has committed the above offences.

Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled out of court

between the petitioner and respondents 2 and 3.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the

respondents 2 and 3. I have also heard the learned Public Prosecutor.

         4.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

during the pendency of the above case, the matter is settled amicably

between the parties to the dispute which is the subject matter of the

above case. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings in the

above case is abuse of process of law and proceedings.

         5. The learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 who on

the basis of specific instruction received       from the respondents

submitted that the above respondents, who are the de facto

Crl.M.C.No.1654 of 2013

                                  :-3-:

complainant and the injured do not intend to proceed any further

against the petitioner and he has no grievance against them.

         6. I have carefully considered the above submissions of the

respective counsel. Annexure A4 is the affidavit sworn by the second

respondent and Annexure A5 by the third respondent. I have verified

the documents and materials produced along with the above petition.

In the given facts and circumstances of the case and especially in the

light of the settlement arrived between the parties to the dispute, the

learned Public Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances involved in

the case, it can be seen that the offences involved in the above case are

only Sections 143,147,148,323,307 read with Section 149 of I.P.C.

which are more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved.     It is pertinent to note that though such offences are

involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this Court after

Crl.M.C.No.1654 of 2013

                                         :-4-:

having amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by the

counsel for respondents 2 and 3, it appears to me that the de facto

complainant and the injured have no further grievance against the

petitioner/ accused in the light of the settlement arrived by them. In

this juncture, it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable

Apex Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4) KLT

108] (SC)] which is squarely applicable in the present case. In Gian

Singh's case, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

                 "57. The position that emerges from the above discussion

         can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a

         criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent

         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a

         criminal court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the

         Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory

         limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline

         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to

         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to

         quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

Crl.M.C.No.1654 of 2013

                                                :-5-:

            exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute

            would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no

            category can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-


             "......... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

             dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the

             purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from

             commercial, financial,mercandile, civil, partnership or such like

             transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry

             etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or

             personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In

             this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

             its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the

             possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

             case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme

             injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case

             despite      full and complete settlement and compromise with the

             victim........"


According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances involved in the

present case and particularly in view of the settlement arrived in the

present case, the dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the

Crl.M.C.No.1654 of 2013

                                    :-6-:

present case. Accord ing to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and encourage such

settlement, instead of compelling the parties to go on with the dispute. It

is pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event

of the trial   proceeded, there would not have any fruitful prosecution

resulting the conviction of the accused, rather the net result would be sheer

waste of judicial time and abuse of process of the court and proceedings.

Thus, according to me, following the decisions cited supra, this Criminal

M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought for.

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing Annexure A2

final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.96 of

2009 of Hosdurg Police Station, which is now pending as S.C.No.310 of

2010 on the file of the Principal Session's Court, Kasaragod.

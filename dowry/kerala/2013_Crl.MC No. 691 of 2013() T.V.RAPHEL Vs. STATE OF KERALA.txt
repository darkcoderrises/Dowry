                        Crl.M.C.No.691 of 2013
                        ----------------------------
                        Dated 21st August, 2013

                                  ORDER

            The petitioner who is working as Circle Inspector of Excise

presently at Koothuparamba is arraigned as the 4th accused in VC20/09

TSR on the files of the Court of Enquiry Commissioner and Special

Judge, Thrissur.     Annexure-I final report No.6/2012 was filed on

1.10.2012    against   the   petitioner  and    his co-accused  alleging

commission of offences punishable under Sections 13(2) read with

Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 read with

Sections 420, 468, 471 and 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code. This

petition has been filed seeking quashment of Annexure-I final report to

the extent it pertains to the petitioner.




            2. The gist of the allegations in Annexure-I against the

petitioner and his co-accused are as hereunder:-

                 "During     the    year   2005,    accused   A4
         Sri.T.V.Raphel while working as the Circle Inspector of
         Excise, Thrissur and accused A5 Sri.Sebastian George
         while working as Assistant Excise Commissioner,
         Thrissur and as such being public servants, with an
         intention to drop out deceased E.Satheeshkumar,
         husband of the de facto complainant Murugarselvi from
         the reconstitution of partnership of Aramana Bar and
         Restaurant, Thrissur through forged declaration dated
         30.09.2004, through corrupt and illegal means, by
         abusing their position as public servants, for pecuniary

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 2


         advantage,     conspired  with   A1    T.K.Sajeevan,    A2
         T.K.Rajeevan and A3 Smt.Rukmani, as a result of the
         said conspiracy, on 20.03.2005 a forged deposition of
         Smt.Murugar Selvi W/o.Late E.Satheeshkumar, 144-145,
         DPF Street, Papanaicker Palayam Coimbatore is prepared
         by the accused to the effect that she is willing to opt out
         from the partnership of Aramana Bar and Restaurant,
         Thrissur, where her husband E.Satheeshkumar had 45%
         of share. On knowing this, de facto complainant Murugar
         Selvi approached A5 and communicated the forgery
         committed by the accused.         A5 willfully avoid her
         contentions and proceeded and used the forged
         deposition as genuine and got the partnership deed of
         Aramana Bar and Restaurant reconstituted in an illegal
         and unlawful manner excluding Smt.Murugar Selvi and
         her minor child Dhina Eswar being the legal heirs of the
         deceased Satheeshkumar. With this reconstitution of the
         partnership firm through illegal manner by which
         complainant sustained loss of her right and her minor
         child's right in the partnership of the said Aramana Bar
         and Restaurant and corresponding undue pecuniary
         advantage to others by the criminal misconduct of the
         accused.

                  The above said acts of the accused constitutes
         criminal conspiracy, abuse of official position in the
         capacity of public servants, criminal misconduct, forgery,
         cheating and using the forged documents as genuine and
         thereby committed the offences punishable U/s 13(2) r/w
         13(1)(d) of PC Act 1988 and Section 420, 468, 471 and
         120(B) IPC."




             3. I have heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

petitioner and also the learned Public Prosecutor.




             4. It is contended by the petitioner that the allegations in

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 3


Annexure-I do not disclose the necessary ingredients to constitute the

offences alleged against him and even if the entire allegations therein are

taken on face value and accepted they would not disclose any cognizable

offence. The allegations and the evidence collected and recorded do not

disclose commission of any offence by the petitioner and in fact, they

make out no case against him, it is contended. The further contentions

are hereunder:-




             The petitioner took charge as Circle Inspector of Excise,

Excise Circle Office, Thrissur on 23.1.2005 as is obvious from Annexure-

II. The declaration dated 30.9.2004 made mention in the final report

was therefore, obviously, obtained prior to his taking charge there.

While admitting the fact that a deposition/statement dated 20.3.2005

(alleged to have been made by the defacto complainant Smt.Murugar

Selvi) was obtained to the effect that herself and her minor child opted

out from the partnership of Aramana Bar and Restaurant it is contended

that the allegation of forgery of the handwriting and signature of

Smt.Murugar Selvi in the said deposition/statement is inconsequential

and absolutely irrelevant in view of the position of the relevant rule as on

20.3.2005. Going by Rule 19 of the Foreign Liquor Rules (for short `the

F.L. Rules' only) obtaining such a statement/deposition was absolutely

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                  4


unnecessary for the reason that as on that date previous sanction of the

Excise Commissioner was not a pre-condition for transfer of licence.

According to the petitioner, on 20.3.2005 Sri.T.K.Sajeevan (A1) and

Smt.Rukmani       (A2),  the     mother    of    the    deceased    partner

E.Satheeshkumar, came to his office along with a lady and they

introduced    that  lady  as    the   wife   of    the  deceased    partner

E.Satheeshkumar. The mother of the deceased Smt.Rukmani produced

her identify card and the imposter produced an identity card issued by

Eye Foundation, Lasik Centre (India) Pvt. Ltd. though it did not contain

her photograph.     In such circumstances there was no room for any

suspicion of impersonation, is the contention. Rule 19(i) of the F.L. Rules

on 20.3.2005, the date on which the statement/deposition in question

allegedly obtained from the defacto complainant, stood as follows:-




             "19(i) under no circumstances shall any licence
       obtained under this notification be sold, transferred or sub-
       rented".




The words "without the previous sanction of the Excise Commissioner"

were omitted by SRO 257/2003 with effect from 25.3.2003. In fact, it is

in the said circumstances that the petitioner raised the contention that

there was absolutely no necessity for obtaining such a deposition/

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 5


statement from the defacto complainant and as such the mere fact that

such a deposition/statement had been taken got no consequence or

relevance as previous sanction of the Excise Commissioner was not a

pre-condition for transfer of licence going by the position of law viz., Rule

19(i) of the F.L. Rules as on 20.3.2005.         The words "without the

previous sanction of the Excise Commissioner" which were omitted by

SRO 257/2003 were re-introduced only with effect from 1.4.2005 as per

SRO 293/2005 and therefore, it is the further contention of the petitioner

that it would not have been in the contemplation of anybody that Rule 19

would be amended and the aforesaid words would be re-introduced in

Rule 19(i) of the Rules.      In such circumstances the learned Senior

Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the allegations in

Annexure-I would not make out any offence against the petitioner and

therefore, continuation of proceedings against the petitioner would be a

wasteful exercise and consequently, liable to be quashed by invoking the

inherent power under Section 482, Cr.P.C. The learned Senior Counsel

relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Harmanpreet

Singh Ahluwalia v. State of Pubjab ((2009) 7 SCC 712), Guru

Bipin Singh v. Chongtham Manihar Singh and Another ((1996) 11

SCC 622) and Punjab National Bank and Others v. Surendra

Prasad Sinha (1993 Supp (1) SCC 499) to buttress the said contention.

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 6




             5. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor contended that

the allegations in Annexure-I final report satisfy the ingredients to

constitute the alleged offences and the sufficiency or otherwise of the

evidence is not a matter for this Court to consider as sifting of the

evidence is not to be done in this proceedings. It is further contended

that the question is not whether as on 20.3.2005 obtaining such a

deposition/statement from the defacto complainant was essential or

relevant and whether the previous sanction of the Excise Commissioner

was a pre-condition for transfer of the licence. According to the learned

Public Prosecutor what matters is the action in obtaining such a

deposition/statement that too, from a lady who impersonated as the wife

of the deceased partner E.Satheeshkumar and then forwarding it to the

Excise Commissioner and therefore, according to him such actions would

be sufficient to connect the petitioner with the commission of the alleged

offences in Annexure-I final report. In short, according to the learned

Public Prosecutor the instant case is not a fit case for invocation of the

inherent power under Section 482, Cr.P.C.




             6. As noticed hereinbefore, the very case of the prosecution

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 7


is that the petitioner had fabricated the deposition of Smt.Murugar Selvi,

the defacto complainant, to the effect that herself and her minor child

opted out from the partnership of Aramana Bar and Restaurant, by

forging her handwriting and signature and based on the same the

partnership deed of Aramana Bar and Restaurant was reconstituted

excluding the legal heirs of the deceased E.Satheeshkumar. The case of

the petitioner is that on 20.3.2005 Sri.T.K.Sajeevan (A1) and

Smt.Rukmani, the mother of the deceased partner E.Satheeshkumar

(A3), came to his office along with a woman and introduced that lady as

the wife of the deceased partner E.Satheeshkumar.           Evidently, the

contention of the petitioner is that at that time the mother of the

deceased viz., Smt.Rukmani (A3) produced her identity card and the

imposter had also produced an identity card issued by Eye-foundation,

Lasik Centre (India) Pvt. Ltd. At the same time, in paragraph 5 of this

petition the petitioner himself stated that the identity card produced by

the imposter did not contain her photograph. When the very allegation

is that the petitioner fabricated the deposition/statement in the aforesaid

manner the case of the petitioner as aforesaid, is a matter of proof and

even if it is proved whether it would save the petitioner from the

culpability is also not a matter for this Court to consider in this

proceedings. As stated earlier, the case of the petitioner is that there

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 8


was     absolutely   no   legal  requirement    for  obtaining   such    a

statement/deposition from the wife of the deceased partner as on the

relevant date viz., on 20.3.2005 because the words "without the

previous sanction of Excise Commissioner" remained omitted by SRO

257/2003 with effect from 25.3.2003 from Rule 19 of the F.L. Rules. I

am afraid, that contention also cannot be taken as a ground for

terminating the proceeding instituted against the petitioner pre-maturily.

Going by the very contention of the petitioner in paragraph 7 of the

petition it is evident that the words "without the previous sanction of

Excise Commissioner" were omitted by SRO 257/2003 from Rule 19 of

the Rules with effect from 25.3.2003 and the statement/deposition in

question was allegedly obtained on 20.3.2005 and those words were

reintroduced as per SRO 293/2005 with effect from 1.4.2005. If that be

the case, it is ununderstable as to why the petitioner had obtained a

deposition/statement    on    20.3.2005    whether   from    the   defacto

complainant or from anybody on getting introduced as the wife of the

deceased partner E.Satheeshkumar if it was not a legal requirement and

statutorily insisted as a condition for the purpose of transfer of licence.

It is in this context that the re-introduction of the words "without the

previous sanction of Excise Commissioner" in Rule 19(i) of the Rules

with effect from 1.4.2005 as per SRO 293/2005 assumes relevance. The

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                 9


contention of the petitioner is that it would not be in contemplation of

anybody that Rule 19(i) of the Rules would be amended by re-

introducing the aforesaid condition. The factual position obtained in this

case would reveal that such a statement/deposition was taken on

20.3.2005 and within a couple of weeks the aforesaid words "without the

previous sanction of Excise Commissioner" were re-introduced in Rule

19(i) of the Rules. It cannot be believed that such an amendment was

made in Rule 19 of the Rules all of a sudden on a fine morning without

any deliberation at all. It is common knowledge that if there was no

proposal and it was not in contemplation sufficiently earlier it would not

have been amended by re-introducing the aforesaid words with effect

from 1.4.2005. Whether it was within the petitioner's knowledge and

whether the statement/deposition was obtained with the knowledge and

for what purpose are not matters to be considered in this proceedings.

At any rate, the said contention of the petitioner cannot form the basis

for abruptly terminating the proceedings initiated against the petitioner.

In the aforesaid circumstances, the question whether there was any

intention on the part of the petitioner for cheating or whether there was

any criminal conspiracy are matters of evidence and at any rate, the

aforesaid contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner cannot be

accepted as a sufficient reason for invoking the inherent jurisdiction to

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013               10


quash Annexure-I F.I.R. carrying such a serious accusation. The very

case of the defacto complainant is that the petitioner had forged the

deposition/statement of the defacto complainant on 20.3.2005 and later,

the partnership deed of Aramana Bar and Restaurant was reconstituted

without the legal heirs of Late E.Satheeshkumar.       In Harmanpreet

Singh Ahluwalia's case (supra) the allegation was one of breach of

trust relating to dowry articles. There was no allegation of commission

of offences punishable under Section 3 or 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act

and the couple concerned were in joint possession of those articles.

Quashability of the FIR was considered and allowed taking into account

such circumstances. In Guru Bipin Singh's case (supra) the complaint

was quashed on the ground that allegations therein do not make out any

case against the appellant and such other circumstances which are

lacking in the instant case. In Punjab National Bank's case (supra)

the action taken by bank authorities in terms of a security bond executed

by guarantor for recovery of outstanding debt was held insufficient to

constitute criminal breach of trust and accordingly, issuance of process

by the Magistrate at the instance of the guarantor was held as one

without application of mind and not justified. On the facts obtained in

this case I am of the considered view that the petitioner cannot seek for

quashment of Annexure-I relying on those decisions of the Hon'ble

Crl.M.C.No.691/2013                11


Supreme Court. I am of the considered view that interfering with the

proceedings instituted against the petitioner and terminating the

proceedings against him would adversely affect the very prosecution

case. I have no hesitation to hold that the petitioner has failed to make

out a case for invocation of the inherent power under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.




             In the above circumstances, this petition is liable to fail and

accordingly, it is dismissed. It is made clear that the observations/

findings made hereinbefore are made solely for the purpose of disposal

of the case on hand.

                     Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014
                   ----------------------------------------
               Dated this the 23rd day of May, 2014

                                O R D E R


     This Crl.M.C. is filed by the accused in S.C.No.336 of 2012 to

quash the proceedings in S.C.No.336 of 2012 on the file of the

Additional Sessions Court (Fast Track-II), Manjeri, on the basis of

settlement under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioners are the

accused in S.C.No.336 of 2012, now pending before the Additional

Sessions Judge (Fast Track-II), Manjeri. The case was originated

on the basis of a statement given by the 1st respondent against

the petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148,

341, 307 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code, as Crime No.72

of 2010 of Karuvarakundu Police Station in Malappuram District.

After investigation, Annexure.2 Final Report was filed and it was

taken on file as C.P.No.29 of 2011 by the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-I, Manjeri. Thereafter, the case was committed

to the Court of Sessions and the learned Sessions Judge, Manjeri

has taken cognizance of the case as S.C.No.336 of 2012. It is now

pending before the Additional Sessions Court (Fast Track-II),

Manjeri as made over by the Sessions Judge for disposal.

Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014         2

      3. There was another case between the same parties and

after investigation, Final Report was filed and it was tried as

S.C.No.301 of 2013 by the Special Judge for trying offences under

the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act and as per judgment dated 25.02.2014 that case

was ended in acquittal on account of the settlement of dispute

between both the parties.      This case also settled due to the

intervention of Mediators. There is no possibility of any conviction

being entered into on account of the settlement.          Since the

offences are non-compoundable in nature they cannot move the

lower court. So they have no other remedy except to approach

this Court seeking the following reliefs.

      4.    The 1st respondent appeared through counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties

due to the intervention of Mediators and the relationship between

them has been restored on account of the settlement. He does

not want to proceed with the prosecution.            He also filed

Annexure.4 affidavit stating these facts.     The counsel for the

petitioners also submitted the in view of the settlement that there

is no possibility of conviction and he prayed for allowing the

application.

Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014          3

      5.    The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, as

directed by this Court, submitted that there is no other case

against the petitioners and there is no criminal background as

well but opposed the application on the ground that Section 307

of the Indian Penal Code is involved.

      6. Heard both sides.

      7. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the statement

given   by    the    defacto  complainant/1st respondent    herein,

Annexure.1, FIR was registered as Crime No.72 of 2010 of

Karuvarakundu Police Station in Malappuram District against the

petitioners alleging offences under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341,

307 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation,

Annexure.2 Final Report was filed and after committal, the case is

now pending before the Additional Sessions Court (Fast Track-II),

Manjeri as S.C.No.336 of 2012. It is also an admitted fact that on

the basis of the statement given by the 2nd petitioner herein,

another crime was registered against the brother of the defacto

complainant herein and others alleging offences under Sections

143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 506(1) read with 149 of the Indian Penal

Code and Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and the

Scheduled     Tribes    (Prevention of  Atrocities)  Act.     After

Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014         4

investigation, Final Report was filed in the case. After committal,

the case was taken on file as S.C.No.301 of 2013 by the Special

Judge for trial of cases under the above Act. As per Annexure.3

judgment, they were acquitted. It is seen from the judgment that

in that case also none of the witnesses have supported the case

of the prosecution on account of the settlement. Now the parties

have settled this dispute as well. On account of the settlement,

the relationship between the parties have been restored to the

original position and the communal tolerance has been restored.

In view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction as

neither the defacto complainant nor the witnesses are likely to

support the prosecution. Further, since it is a dispute between

two communal people which has been settled amicably due to the

intervention of well wishers of both the community, it cannot be

treated as a case of public interest as such. Further, I am not at

this stage going to the question as to whether the offence under

Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code will be attracted or not as

well. No purpose will be served by allowing the case to proceed

with, in view of the settlement and that will only cause to the

wastage of judicial time.

      8. Further in the decision reported in Gian Singh v. State of

Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014            5

Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

held that:

      "But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
      dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the
      purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
      commercial, financial mercantile, civil, partnership or such
      like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the
      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
      cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its
      view, because of the compromise between the offender and
      victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
      continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
      oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
      caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
      and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of the
      criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process
      of law despite settlement and compromise between the
      victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
      justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
      and if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative,
      the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash
      the criminal proceeding."

      9. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and

also considering the fact that the matter has been settled

between the parties due to the intervention of Mediators,

communal harmony has been brought in on account of the

settlement between the members of the two communities, there

is no possibility of conviction in view of the settlement and

Crl.M.C.No. 2130 of 2014             6

allowing the case to proceed with will only amount to wastage of

judicial time, this Court feels that it is a fit case where the power

under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings.

        In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings

in S.C.No.336 of 2012 (Crime No.72 of 2010 of Karuvarakundu

Police Station of Malappuram District) now pending before the

Additional Sessions Court (Fast Track-II), Manjeri as against the

petitioners is quashed. Office is directed to communicate this

order to the concerned court immediately for further necessary

action.

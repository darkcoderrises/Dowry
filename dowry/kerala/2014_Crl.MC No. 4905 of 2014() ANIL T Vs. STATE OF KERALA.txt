               Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                -------------------------------
        Dated this the 27th day of August, 2014.


                        O R D E R

       The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the

instance of the petitioner, who is the accused in Crime

No.1327 of 2013 of Taliparamba Police Station for the

offences punishable under Sections 363 and 376 of I.P.C.

and section 3(a) of Protection of Children from Sexual

Offences Act with a prayer to quash Annexure A1 FIR in

the above crime, as the matter is settled out of court.

       2.  The allegation in the above case is that on

19.11.2013 the 3rd respondent had gone out of the house in

the morning stating that she is going to Chinmaya School

for teaching practice, but she did not come back to home

from the school after teaching practice and it is alleged by

the 2nd respondent, who is the mother of the victim, that

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                              2

the 3rd respondent/de facto complainant had went along

with the petitioner, who is their neighbour, as the 3rd

respondent is in love with him and thereby the petitioner

has committed the offence as alleged by the prosecution.

Now, the case of the petitioner is that the matter is settled

out of court.

         3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the 2nd and 3rd respondents. I have also heard the

learned Public Prosecutor.

         4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute, which

is the subject matter of the above case, as per the

compounding petition dated 16.8.2014 and also as per the

affidavits filed by the 2nd and 3rd respondents.    Both the

learned counsel for the petitioner and the contesting

respondents submitted that after attaining majority of the

3rd respondent, the marriage between the petitioner and

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                                3

the 3rd respondent was solemnised on 15.1.2014 and now

they are residing as man and wife, leading a peaceful

marital life. Therefore, the continuation of the proceedings

in the above case will adversely affect their family life and

therefore the proceedings pending against the petitioner

has to be quashed.

         5.     The learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

respondents who on the basis of specific instruction

received from the respondents submitted that the above

respondents, who are the victim and the de facto

complainant, do not intends to proceed any further against

the petitioner and they have no grievance against him.

         6.       I   have carefully considered  the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived

between the parties to the dispute, the learned Public

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                              4

Prosecutor has also no objection in allowing the above

petition.

         7. Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 363 and

376 of I.P.C. and section 3(a) of Protection of Children from

Sexual Offences Act, which are more or less personal in

nature and no public interest is involved. It is pertinent to

note that though such offences are involved, the real

parties to the dispute approached this Court after having

amicably settled the matter. From the submission made by

the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, it appears to

me that the the victim and the de facto complainant have

no further grievance against the petitioner/accused in the

light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture, it

is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)]. In Gian Singh's case, the Supreme Court

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                                    5

has held as follows:-

                 "57.  The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus: the
         power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
         proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
         inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
         the power given to a criminal court for
         compounding the offences under S.320 of the
         Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with
         no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised
         in accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
         prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In
         what      cases power    to   quash   the   criminal
         proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no category
         can be prescribed."

It is further held as follows:-

         ".........  But   the   criminal    cases    having
         overwhelmingly      and    pre-dominatingly     civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
         arising from commercial, financial, mercandile,
         civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
         offences arising out of matrimony relating to
         dowry etc. or the family disputes where the
         wrong is basically private or personal in nature
         and the parties have resolved their entire
         dispute. In this category of cases, High Court
         may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case
         would put accused to great oppression and
         prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
         to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                                   6

         full and complete settlement and compromise
         with the victim........"

According to me, in the light of the facts and circumstances

involved in the present case and particularly in view of the

settlement arrived in the present case, the dictum laid in

the above decision is applicable in the present case.

According to me, as the parties to the dispute settled the

issues amicably, it is the duty of this Court to promote and

encourage such settlement, instead of compelling the

parties to go on with the dispute. It is pertinent to note

that since the matter is settled out of court, in the event of

proceeding with the trial, there would not have any fruitful

prosecution resulting the conviction of the accused, rather

the net result would be sheer waste of judicial time and

abuse of process of the court and proceedings.          Thus,

according to me, following the decision cited supra, this

Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the relief as sought

for.

Crl.M.C.No.4905 of 2014
                              7

         In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing

Annexure A1 FIR in Crime No.1327 of 2013 of Taliparamba

Police Station and all further proceedings pending against

the petitioner therein.

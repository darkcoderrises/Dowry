           ======================================
                     CRL.R.P. NO. 1917 OF 2008
           ======================================
                 Dated this the 16th day of June 2008

                               ORDER

     Heard both sides.

     2. Petitioner, who is the father of one Anitha Pathiyil who

died of burn injuries at her matrimonial home in the United

States of America, challenges Annexure-A order dated 31.5.2008

passed by the JFCM, Palakkad permitting respondents 1 and 2

(accused Nos.2 and 3) to leave India for the period from

15.6.2008 to 15.10.2008 for the purpose of visiting their second

son Sajeesh and for attending the official graduation ceremony of

Sajeesh scheduled to be held in August 2008.

     3. On the directions of this Court, respondents 1 and 2 have

appeared in person before this Court today. Both of them as well

as their counsel Sri.Jacob Sebastian have stated that they were

interrogated by the DYSP who was in charge of the investigation.

     4. The impugned order was passed by the learned

Magistrate in compliance with the order dated 12.7.2007 passed

by this Court in B.A.4184/2007 while granting anticipatory bail to

CRRP 1917/2008             2

respondents 1 and 2. One of the bail conditions imposed by this

Court was that respondents 1 and 2 herein shall not leave India

without prior permission of the learned Magistrate. That is why

respondents 1 and 2 moved the Magistrate seeking permission.

      3. Even though this Court did not impose any further fetters

while imposing the above condition, in view of the apprehension

expressed by the petitioner that this was a case of dowry death

and respondents 1 and 2 if unconditionally permitted to leave

the country, may flee from justice, the learned Magistrate shall

insist on respondents 1 and 2 executing a bond for such amount

and on such conditions which ensure their presence during the

trial of the case. Respondents 1 and 2 shall be entitled to leave

India only after executing the said bond within a week from

today.

      This Crl.Revision Petition is disposed of as above.




                                   V.RAMKUMAR, JUDGE

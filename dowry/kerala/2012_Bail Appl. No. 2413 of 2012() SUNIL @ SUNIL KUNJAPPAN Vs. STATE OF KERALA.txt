             ---------------------------------------
                    B.A. No. 2413 of 2012
            ----------------------------------------
           Dated this the 20th day of April, 2012

                            ORDER

     Petitioners are accused 1 to 4, in Crime No.407 of 2012 of

Chathanoor Police Station for offence punishable under Sec. 498

A r/w Sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. First petitioner is the

husband of de-facto complainant. Second and third petitioners

are parents and fourth petitioner is the sister of first petitioner.

Allegation is that the de-facto complainant was tortured

physically and mentally form 20.4.2009 with intend to extract

dowry (as she alleges).

     2. Learned counsel submits that first petitioner and the de-

facto complainant are living separately from 28.1.2009 and that

allegations are false. According to the petitioners, the de-facto

complainant has some mental problem and hence first petitioner

issued annexure A notice to the de-facto complainant on

19.4.2010.

     3. I have heard learned Public Prosecutor also.

     4. Having regard to the allegation made against petitioners,

B.A. No. 2413 of 2012             -2-


I am inclined to think that custodial interrogation is not required.

      Hence this application is allowed. Petitioners shall appear

before the Officer investigating the case before 10 am within 10

days from this day for interrogation. In case of their arrest, they

shall be released on bail on their executing bond for Rs.10,000/-

(Rupees ten thousand) each with two sureties each for the like

sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer and subject

to following conditions:

      i) Petitioners shall report before the Investigating Officer as

and when required for interrogation.

      ii) Petitioner shall not go beyond Kollam District without the

permission of learned Magistrate, Paravoor (Kollam).

      iii) Petitioners shall not intimidate/influence the witnesses

or tamper with the evidence.

      If any modification, relaxation or lifting of the conditions

imposed hereby is required, petitioner may approach learned

Magistrate, Paravoor (Kollam) and if any such application is filed

and if the learned Magistrate is satisfied that circumstance

warrant such modification, relaxation or lifting of conditions, it is

B.A. No. 2413 of 2012            -3-


open to the learned Magistrate to pass appropriate orders in that

regard as held in P.K. Shaji v. State of Kerala (AIR 2006 SC

100).

     It is made clear that in case of violation of any of the above

conditions or for other valid reasons it will be open to the learned

Magistrate, Paravoor (Kollam) to cancel the bail granted hereby

as held in P.K. Shaji v. State of Kerala (Supra).




                                              THOMAS P JOSEPH,
                                                    JUDGE.

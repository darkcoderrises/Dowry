Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.    Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.16/2012 of

Koothattukulam Police Station registered for the offence

punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

     3.    Petitioner has come up with this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. for getting Annexure-A1 Final Report in

Crime No.16/2012 of Koothattumulam Police Station as

against the petitioner and all further proceedings based on it

in C.C.7/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court, Koothattukulam, quashed.

     4.    The allegation against the petitioner is that he

has tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who is

his wife, and treated her with cruelty within the meaning of

Crl.M.C.963/2015
                               : 2 :

      5.     According to the petitioner, all the matters in

dispute between the petitioner and the defacto complainant

have been amicably settled in mediation and presently, the

defacto complainant has no complaints against the

petitioner and, therefore, the proceedings against the

petitioner may be quashed.

respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the

amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioner and, therefore, all further proceedings

in the matter referred to above can be quashed. She has

entered appearance through her counsel.

      7.     When all the matrimonial disputes have been

settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant

has no complaints against the petitioner, it is only just and

expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings

                   ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
           =========================
                     B.A.No.7169 of 2014
         ============================
          Dated this the 20th day of October, 2014

                             ORDER



           The    petitioners    have    approached      this    Court

apprehending arrest in a crime registered at the instance of the

wife of the first petitioner, at Vanchiyoor Police Station,

Thiruvananthapuram for the alleged offences under Section 498A

and 506(i) r/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

      2. Petitioners 2 to 4 are the father, mother and brother of

the first petitioner. 5th petitioner is the wife of the 4th petitioner

and the mother of a two month old child. 6th petitioner is the

mother of the 5th petitioner and she is a widow.           7th and 8th

petitioners are the sister and brother-in-law of the first petitioner.

      3.   It is the case of the petitioner that the de facto

complainant herein had lodged a complaint before the Sub

Inspector of Police, Thrikkakkara Police Station, Eranakulam

alleging cruelty and Crime No.1155/2014 of Thrikkakkara Police

Station was registered for offence punishable under Section 498A

of Indian Penal Code.       The Sessions Court, Ernakulam had

B.A No.7169 of 2014             2



granted anticipatory bail to all the petitioners herein in the

aforementioned crime as per order dated 29.08.2014 in Crl.M.C

No.1601 of 2014, which is produced as Annexure 2. It is averred

by the petitioner that getting infuriated by the grant of

anticipatory bail as per Annexure 2, the de facto complainant

herein has submitted another complaint to the police authorities

at Vanchiyoor Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram for the

alleged offences under Sections 498A and 506(i) r/w Section 34

of the Indian Penal Code on 03.09.2014. Petitioners apprehends

that the Vanchiyoor police authorities would have registered

another crime on the same set of allegations as in the crime

related to Annexure 2 order and that apprehending arrest in the

new crime, they invoked the remedy conferred under Section

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of pre-arrest

bail.

      4. Sri.Manu Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner, would

strongly urge that all the allegations raised against the

petitioners, both in the crime registered at Thrikkakkara Police

Station and in the complaint lodged before the Vanchiyoor Police

Station, are the same and are absolutely false and untenable and

these allegations are made only to victimise and harass the

B.A No.7169 of 2014              3



petitioners and he prays for grant of anticipatory bail in this

case.

      5.     The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,

submitted that a complaint was received on 03.09.2014 at

Vanchiyoor Police Station from the defacto complainant herein

alleging that at the time of her marriage with the first petitioner,

she had worn 100 sovereigns of gold ornaments and her parents

given her property of 50 cents as paternal share of the bride and

that after marriage she was staying at her husband's house at

Kaimanoor House, Near ITI Jn., Chengannur and the gold

ornaments and money brought by the defacto complainant were

taken by the petitioner and his relatives for their own purposes.

While the de facto complainant was staying in her husband's

residence and at husband's sister's house at Ernakulam and her

husband's overseas work place at Sharja, she had been

physically and mentally harassed by the petitioner and his

relatives demanding more dowry and that based on the said

statement/complaint given by her to the Sub Inspector of Police,

Vanchiyoor Police Station, Crime No.1055 of 2014 for offences

under Sections 498A and 506(i) r/w Section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code was registered at the Vanchiyoor Police Station on

B.A No.7169 of 2014               4



03.09.2014.      After registration of the crime, the CD file was

transferred to Chengannur Police Station through City Police

Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram City on 19.09.2014 and the

CD file was received at Chengannur Police Station on

16.10.2014 through the office of District Police Chief, Alappuzha

and Asst. Superintendent of Police, Chengannur. It has also been

stated by the learned Public Prosecutor that the Sub Inspector of

Police, Chengannuur Police Station, in his written instruction,

has informed the learned Public Prosecutor that in view of the

decisions of the Apex court in the case Vijayaratna Sarma Vs

State of UP rendered in 1988 the matter was considered and the

CD file in Vanchiyoor Police Station in Crime No.1055 of 2014

was    returned to the FIR generated Police Station through

higher offices, for further investigation on 16.10.2014 itself.

No crime cases are registered at Chengannur Police Station

based on the CD file in Vanchiyoor Police Station under Sections

498A, 506(i) r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.         The

learned Public Prosecutor would also submit that the legal

advice of the Director General of Prosecution or any of the senior

law officers attached to this Court would be appropriately sought

for in this matter and it is only based on such advise the police

B.A No.7169 of 2014                   5



authorities would proceed further. The learned Public Prosecutor

would submit that in case any further action is required in the

aforementioned complaint submitted by the defacto complainant

herein on 03.09.2014 after such process, then, appropriate

notice under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure will

be issued to all such affected persons concerned and the matter

will be proceeded only thereafter.

     The application stands finally disposed of recording the

above said submissions.

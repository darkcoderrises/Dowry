                        W.P.(C). NO. 21619 OF 2011
                     --------------------------------------------
                   Dated this the 25th day of August, 2011

                                  JUDGMENT

      The petitioner is a Police Constable Driver in CBCID, OCW-1,

Crime Branch Thiruvananthapuram. He was placed under suspension as

per Ext.P1 order dated 1.12.2010.            Evidently, it is Ext.P2 complaint

submitted by one Smt.Kalpana P.K that led to the suspension of the

petitioner. The contention of the petitioner is that the allegations made as

per Ext.P2 complaint are false and absolutely incorrect. In Ext.P2, it is

stated that the marriage of the petitioner with the sister of the complainant

viz., Smt.Preethy P.K, was fixed to be solemnised on 30.8.2010.

According to the complainant, they took a decision not to go on with the

proposal as the petitioner demanded dowry and, they had to request the

petitioner to return Rs.2 lakhs received by him. To contend that it is a

frivolous complaint, the petitioner has produced Ext.P3 which is a piece of

news item appeared in Malayala Manorama daily dated 27.8.2010. It

would reveal the real state of affairs, according to the petitioner. In

Ext.P3, it is stated thus:-

              "       P.    

W.P.(C) NO.21619 of 2011               2



                                                            
                        ."

      2.     Subsequently, the petitioner was served with Ext.P4 memo of

charges.   On its receipt, the petitioner has submitted Ext.P5 reply on

8.4.2011. Subsequently, the complainant herself submitted Ext.P6 request

dated 22.12.2010 before the third respondent seeking permission to

withdraw Ext.P2 complaint.       The contention of the petitioner is that

hitherto, Ext.P6 was not at all taken into consideration by the respondents.

It is further contended that despite the lapse of about more than nine

months since his suspension, no steps were taken by the respondents to

review the order of suspension. Ext.P6 would reveal that it is unnecessary

to continue with the suspension of the petitioner any further, it is

contended. That apart, it is further contended that the enquiry ordered

against him should have been completed within two months going by

Ext.P1. However, the oral enquiry is yet to be started. It is in the said

circumstances that the petitioner contends that there is absolutely no

reason for the respondents to place the petitioner under suspension. In the

circumstances emerging in this case, I am of the considered view that the

respondents are bound to examine whether the continuance of suspension

is required or not. In that view of the matter, this Writ Petition is disposed

W.P.(C) NO.21619 of 2011              3



of granting liberty to the petitioner to move the third respondent with a

proper petition seeking review of Ext.P1 order. The petitioner may do so

within a period of two weeks from today. In case the petitioner prefers

such a petition within the stipulated time, the same shall be considered by

the third respondent expeditiously, at any rate, within a period of one

month from the date of receipt of such a petition. In case the petitioner is

aggrieved by the delay in the matter of disciplinary proceedings, it will be

open to him to raise such grievances in appropriate proceedings.

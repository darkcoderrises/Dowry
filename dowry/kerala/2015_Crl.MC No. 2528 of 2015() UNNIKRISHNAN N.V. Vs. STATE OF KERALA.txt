                         O R D E R

    The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.

No.407/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-VI, Kozhikode. The above case was

originally registered as Crime No.657/2013 of Kasaba

Police Station, Kozhikode. Respondent No.2 is the de

facto complainant and the crime was registered for

the offence punishable under Section 324 of the Indian

Penal Code.  In this petition, it is stated that the

dispute between the petitioner and the second

respondent are purely personal in nature and they

have already settled the entire dispute and now the

second respondent does not entertain to proceed with

prosecution against the petitioner.              The second

respondent has filed an affidavit stating that he has

no subsisting grievance against the petitioner and he

Crl.M.C.2528/15-C            :2:



wants to put an end to the prosecution against the

petitioner. The petitioner and the second respondent

jointly filed an application under Section 320 read

with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

also. This Crl.M.C. is filed with a prayer to quash the

prosecution against the petitioner under Ext.A1 F.I.R.

pending in prosecution under C.C. No.407/2014 on the

files    of     the Judicial First  Class   Magistrate's

Court-VI, Kozhikode.

      2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and the learned Public Prosecutor.

      3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that what is stated in the affidavit filed by the

second respondent is true and correct to the best of

his knowledge and belief. The learned counsel for the

second respondent also urged for quashing the

proceedings in C.C. No.407/2014 invoking inherent

jurisdiction and power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

In support of the above argument, the learned counsel

Crl.M.C.2528/15-C              :3:



for the petitioner cited Gian Singh v. State of Punjab

[2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

      4. I have meticulously considered the decision

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT

108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the

Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question

whether the High Court has power to quash criminal

proceedings involving non-compoundable offences on

the basis of the compromise reached between the

offender and the victim and answered as given below:

         "57.    The position that emerges from the
         above discussion can be summarised thus:
         the power of the High Court in quashing a
         criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
         exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
         distinct and different from the power given
         to a criminal court for compounding the
         offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent
         power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
         limitation but it has to be exercised in
         accord with the guideline engrafted in such
         power viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or
         (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
         Court.   In what cases power to quash the
         criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.
         may be exercised where the offender and
         victim have settled their dispute would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of
         each case and no category can be prescribed.
         However, before exercise of such power, the

Crl.M.C.2528/15-C              :4:



         High Court must have due regard to the
         nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
         serious offences of mental depravity or
         offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,
         cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
         victim or victim's family and the offender
         have settled the dispute. Such offences are
         not private in nature and have serious
         impact    on   society.     Similarly,   any
         compromise between the victim and offender
         in relation to the offences under special
         statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act
         or     the offences  committed    by  public
         servants while working in that capacity etc;
         cannot provide for any basis for quashing
         criminal    proceedings    involving    such
         offences.    But the criminal cases having
         overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
         flavour stand on different footing for the
         purposes   of  quashing,   particularly  the
         offences arising from commercial, financial,
         mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
         transactions or the offences arising out of
         matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the
         family disputes where the wrong is basically
         private or personal in nature and the parties
         have resolved their entire dispute. In this
         category of cases, High Court may quash
         criminal proceedings if in its view, because
         of the compromise between the offender and
         victim, the possibility of conviction is
         remote, bleak and continuation of criminal
         case would put accused to great oppression
         and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
         caused to him by not quashing the criminal
         case despite full and complete settlement
         and compromise with the victim. In other
         words, the High Court must consider whether
         it would be unfair or contrary to the
         interest of justice to continue with the
         criminal proceeding or continuation of the

Crl.M.C.2528/15-C              :5:



         criminal proceeding would tantamount to
         abuse of process of law despite settlement
         and compromise between the victim and
         wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
         justice, it is appropriate that criminal case
         is put to an end and if the answer to the
         above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
         Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
         quash the criminal proceeding."

      5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the

inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Prima

facie, I find that the offences alleged against the

petitioners will not come under the category of non-

compoundable        offences,   which    are    specifically

excluded from composition, in the exercise of

inherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by

the affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is

seen that the dispute between the accused and the

victim had been amicably settled and at present the

de facto complainant has no subsisting grievance at

all.     The de facto complainant does not want to

Crl.M.C.2528/15-C             :6:



proceed with prosecution against the accused.       Full

and final settlement and compromise with the victim

are evidenced by the affidavit filed by the second

respondent.       In view of the compromise between the

petitioner and the victim, I find that the possibility

of conviction is remote, bleak, and continuation of

the criminal case would put the parties to great

oppression, prejudice and also tantamount to abuse of

the process of the court.          The present criminal

prosecution against the accused must be put to an end

to secure the interest of justice.

      6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings

against the petitioner under Annexure-A1 F.I.R. will

stand quashed, in the exercise of jurisdiction and

power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

      This petition is allowed.

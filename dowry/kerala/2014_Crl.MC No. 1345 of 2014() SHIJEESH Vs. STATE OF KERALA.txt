    ==============================
           Crl.M.C.Nos.1347 & 1345 of 2014
    ==============================
        Dated this, the 28th day of March, 2014.


                           O R D E R



      These petitions were filed by the respective accused in

S.C.No.933/10 and S.C.No.30/11 pending before Court of

Principal Sessions Judge, Thrissur to quash the proceedings on

the basis of settlement under Section 482 of Code of Criminal

Procedure.

      2.   It is alleged in the petition that on the basis of the

statement given by the second respondent in both the cases as

de facto complainant, Pavaratty police registered a case as

Crime No.285/09 of Pavaratty Police Station alleging offences

under Sections 342, 323, 324, 506(i) read with Section 34 of

Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(iii) of Scheduled Castes

and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and after

investigation, final report has been filed against the petitioners

in both the cases. It was taken on file by the Judicial First

Class Magistrate, Chavakkad and originally petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.1347/14      alone   appeared     and    the   learned

magistrate committed the case as against those persons to the

Sessions Court and the Sessions Court has taken cognizance of

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 2 :

the    case    as    S.C.No.933/10.     Thereafter,   petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.1345/14 also appeared before the Committal Court

and later, case against him was also committed to the Special

Court trying the offences under Scheduled Castes and

Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Special

Court has taken cognizance of that accused as S.C.No.30/11

and both these cases are now pending before Principal

Sessions Court, Thrissur. In the meantime, the matter was

settled between the de facto complainant and petitioners in

both the cases who are the accused in the case. In view of the

settlement, there is no possibility of any conviction being

entered into against the petitioners. Since the offence under

the provisions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act is not compoundable one, they

have no option except to approach this court for quashing the

proceedings.      So, they have filed this petition seeking the

following relief:

          "To quash all further proceedings in SC Nos.933/2010 &

    30/2011 pending on the file of the Principal Sessions Court,

    Thrissur as it is an abuse of process of court."

      3.     The     learned    Public  Prosecutor    opposed   the

application and earlier filed a statement stating that first

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 3 :

accused has involved in Crime No.270/02 under Section 341,

323, 324 of Indian Penal Code, Crime No.341/04 under Section

379 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, Crime

No.153/08 under Section 7 and 8 of Kerala Gaming Act, Crime

No.626/09 under Section 7 and 8 of Kerala Gaming Act and

proceedings under Section 107 of Code of Criminal Procedure

has been initiated in the year 2002 and he is shown in the

rowdy history sheet maintained in the Pavaratty police station.

It is also mentioned that second accused is accused in Crime

No.91/09 under Section 7 and 8 of Kerala Gaming Act, Crime

No.153/08 under Section 7 and 8 of Kerala Gaming Act and

Crime No.279/09 under Sections 280 and 337 of Indian Penal

Code and third accused was accused in Crime No.175/12 under

Section 15 of the Kerala Gaming Act, Crime No.37/02 under

Sections 341, 323, 324 of Indian Penal Code, Crime No. 47/02

under Section 107 of Code of Criminal Procedure, Crime

No.911/13 under Section 15(C) of Abkari Act, Crime

No.341/04 under section 379 read with Section 34 of Indian

Penal Code and Crime No.91/09 under Section 7 and 8 of

Kerala Gaming Act and they are habitual offenders and so, this

cannot be quashed. Subsequently, an additional report was

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 4 :

filed in which it was mentioned that as against the first

accused Crime No.341/04 was ended in acquittal and in Crime

No.153/08, he pleaded guilty and he was sentenced to pay fine

of Rs.500/- and in Crime No.626/09, he pleaded guilty and he

was sentenced to pay fine and in Crime No.270/02 was

compounded and he was acquitted and in Crime No.48/02 he

was acquitted.        Similarly, as regards second accused is

concerned, in all the cases he had pleaded guilty and was

sentenced to pay fine alone. As against the third accused is

concerned except Crime No.911/13 which was recently

registered for offence under Section 15(C) of the Abkari Act, in

all other cases, either ended in acquittal or he pleaded guilty

and fine alone was imposed and the new case namely Crime

No.911/13 final report has not been filed and it is only an

offence under 15(C) of the Abkari Act which is only a minor

offence.

      4.     The Counsel for the petitioners submitted that in

view of the settlement, there is no possibility of conviction.

Further, both these persons were working in the same school

and there was some misunderstanding occurred and in that the

incident happened and the crime was registered. Now, they

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 5 :

have settled the issues and they are now working in the same

school harmoniously on account of the settlement. The second

respondent in both the cases appeared through Counsel and

submitted that the matter has been settled and he does not

want to proceed against the petitioners in both the cases and

the dispute between them was resolved and harmony has been

restored and they are now working together in the same

school on account of the settlement.

      5.     It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the

statement given by second respondent in both the cases, a

crime was registered including offence under the provisions of

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act and after investigation, final report was filed

and the case against the accused persons namely the

petitioners in both the cases were committed to the Sessions

Court on two occasions and on the basis of the committal, the

case against the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.1347/14 was taken

on file as S.C.No.933/10 and case against the petitioner in

Crl.M.C.No.1345/14 was taken on file as S.C.No.30/11 and

both are now pending before Principles Sessions Court,

Thrissur. It is also seen from the pleadings that the matter

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 6 :

has been settled between the petitioners in both the cases and

the de facto complainant who is shown as second respondent

in both the cases. It is seen from the allegations in the final

report that the incident itself happened from the school

compound when there was some dispute arose between the

petitioners in both the cases and the de facto complaint and it

was on that basis, the crime was registered. Subsequently,

the matter has been settled between the accused persons and

the de facto complainant due to the intervention of the

mediators and the school authorities and now, both of them

are working in the same school without any difficulty on

account of the settlement. It is true that the petitioners are

not without any criminal background. They were shown as

accused persons in several cases and in most of the cases they

pleaded guilty and fine alone was imposed and in some of the

cases they were acquitted as well. The only pending case

against 3rd accused is an offence under Section 15(C) of the

Abkari Act which is a minor offence.      It is true that  first

accused is shown in the rowdy history list maintained in the

pavaratty police station as well.     Most of the cases alleged

against the accused persons except the third accused were of

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 7 :

the year 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009. The prosecutor had no

case that accused Nos.1 and 2 have involved in any other

crime thereafter.       Further, this case has happened from the

school compound and on account of settlement, harmony has

been restored between the accused persons and the de facto

complainant and now they are working in the same school

smoothly on account of the settlement.

      6.     It is true that the offence under the provisions of

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of

Atrocities) Act has to be viewed seriously as the enactment

itself has been made for the purpose of protecting the

communities mentioned therein as on account of their caste

they are being exploited by upper caste people and in order to

protect them from such exploitation, the special enactment has

been enacted. But, at the same time, when the victim under

the Act himself comes before the court and says that the

matter has been settled between them on account of

intervention of mediators and well wishers and on account of

the settlement the misunderstanding between them has been

resolved and now they are working smoothly in the school,

then, the court must honour that words of the victim and that

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 8 :

benefit must be given to the accused persons as pendency of

this case should not be a hurdle for the harmony that has been

created between the two community people.

      7.     In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

             "The position that emerges from the above
      discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
      High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or F.I.R.
      or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
      distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
      court for compounding the offences under S.320 of the
      Code.    Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
      statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
      with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to
      secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
      process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the
      criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
      exercised where the offender and victim have settled
      their   dispute   would    depend    on  the   facts  and
      circumstances of each case and no category can be
      prescribed.    However, before exercise of such power,
      the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
      gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
      mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
      etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim
      or victim's family and the offender have settled the
      dispute.   Such offences are not private in nature and
      have serious impact on society.            Similarly, any
      compromise between the victim and offender in relation
      to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
      Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
      servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
      provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
      involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
      overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand
      on different footing for the purposes of quashing,
      particularly the offences arising from commercial,
      financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership or such like
      transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
      relating to dowry, etc; or the family disputes where the

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 :  9 :

      wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the
      parties have resolved their entire dispute.        In this
      category of case, High Court may quash criminal
      proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
      between the offender and victim, the possibility of
      conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
      criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
      prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
      by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
      complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
      In other words, the High Court must consider whether it
      would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
      continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
      the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of
      process of law despite settlement and compromise
      between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
      secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
      case is put to end and if the answer to the above
      question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."


      8.     In view of the dictum laid down in the above

decision and also considering the fact that no purpose will be

served by proceeding with the case in view of the settlement

and harmony restored between the de facto complainant and

the accused persons and possibility of conviction is remote and

allowing the prosecution to continue in such circumstances will

only be a wastage of judicial time, this court feels that the

power under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure can be

invoked to quash the proceedings to promote the settlement

arrived at between the parties which resulted in harmony

between two community people and smooth functioning in the

Crl.M.C.Nos.1345 & 1347 of 2014 : 10 :

school where they are working has been restored.

      So, the applications are allowed and further proceedings

in S.C.Nos. 933/10 and 30/11 pending before the Principal

Sessions Court, Thrissur as against petitioners in both the

cases are quashed.         Office is directed to communicate this

order to the concerned court immediately for necessary further

action.

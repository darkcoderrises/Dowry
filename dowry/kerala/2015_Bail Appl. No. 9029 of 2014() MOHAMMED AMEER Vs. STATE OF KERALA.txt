          Dated this the 12th day of January, 2015

                              O R D E R

     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     The    petitioner     is    the     first     accused   in crime

No.553/2014 of Badiadka Police Station, which has been

registered for the offences under Sections 323, 403, 498A

r/w. 34 IPC. The other accused are his parents and in-laws.

     2.   The marriage between the petitioner and the

victim was solemnized in September, 2014. It is alleged

that he along with the co-accused subjected her to cruelty

both physical and mental demanding more dowry.

     3.   The learned counsel submits that the allegations

are false and if the petitioner happens to be detained it may

ruin their future life.

     4.   Heard.

     5.   The petitioner and the victim has been married

for about 4 or 5 months. There is no allegation that the

petitioner or the other accused inflicted any serious injury

B.A. No.9029 of 2014
                                -2-

to the victim. If the petitioner happens to be detained every

chance of bringing back peace to the family will be lost

forever. So I am inclined to grant his prayer.

      In the result, this application is allowed.

  1) The petitioner shall be released on bail after

        interrogation   on    his  executing   a   bond    for

        Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only)

        with two solvent sureties each for the like sum if he

        is arrested by the police in connection with this

        case.

  2) He shall appear before the Investigating Officer for

        interrogation if he is so required by him in writing.

  3) He shall not communicate or contact the victim

        except with the previous permission of the learned

        magistrate concerned.

   4) He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the

        witnesses.

               This order is not applicable if the petitioner

        chooses to surrender before the Magistrate

        may take appropriate action in accordance with the

        law.

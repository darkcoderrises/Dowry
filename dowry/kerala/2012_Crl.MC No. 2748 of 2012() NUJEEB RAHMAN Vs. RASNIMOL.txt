                    -------------------------------
                  Crl.M.C.NO.2748 OF 2012
                  -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 9th day of October, 2012

                            O R D E R



      Petitioners are some of the accused in a pending case

numbered as C.C.No.590 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Palakkad. The above case has arisen

from a complaint filed by the 1st respondent before the

magistrate imputing matrimonial cruelty and harassment

demanding dowry by her husband, his mother and his relatives,

naming the accused persons eight in number. Cognizance taken

of the offence under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, the

magistrate ordered process to the accused; and the petitioners,

some of the accused (A1, A2 and A4 to A6) have filed the above

petition to quash the criminal proceedings against them

contending that it is an abuse of process of the court.



      2.    Notice given, the 1st respondent/complainant has

entered appearance through counsel. Learned counsel for the

Crl.M.C.No.2748/2012               2




petitioner submitted that previously imputing the offence under

Section 498A of IPC raising some allegations different from

those canvassed in the present complaint, the complainant had

approached the Vanitha Cell, Palakkad. While the matter was

pending enquiry before the Vanitha Cell, on intervention of third

parties and well-wishers, a settlement was reached and an

agreement (Annexure A2) was entered into by the spouses, the

1st petitioner and also the 1st respondent/complainant. Under the

terms of Annexure A2 agreement, the complaint filed before the

Vanitha Cell was withdrawn and whatever amount which had

been collected from the complainant had also been returned to

her. Later, she has filed the present complaint in which apart

from some of the accused persons named in her previous

complaint before the Vanitha Cell some others also are added,

incorporating different allegations not imputed in the previous

complaint.       The magistrate taking cognizance of the offence

imputed after recording the sworn statement of the complainant,

has issued process to the accused persons.        In view of the

agreement entered into by the parties under Annexure A2, by

Crl.M.C.No.2748/2012           3




which, whatever proceedings initiated by the complainant on her

complaint filed before the Police, Vanitha Cell had been

terminated, the present complaint and proceedings taken thereof

are clearly an abuse of process of the court and it is intended

only to vex and harass the petitioners and others named as

accused in the case, is the submission of the counsel. On the

other hand, learned counsel for the 1st respondent/complainant

adverting to the statements made in Annexure A2 agreement

submitted that when that agreement was made complainant was

carrying, and that too having advanced pregnancy by nine

months, and the terms of settlement arrived has to be

appreciated taking note of her condition then.   At any rate, the

settlement so effected would not preclude her from filing a

complaint to proceed against the husband and his relatives for

the offence of matrimonial cruelty, according to the counsel. At

this stage, when evidence of the complainant is yet to be

recorded in an enquiry under Section 244 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, and provisions under the Code enable the

accused to set forth the plea of discharge, exercise of the

Crl.M.C.No.2748/2012             4




inherent powers of this Court is not warranted, is the submission

of the learned counsel for the 1st respondent.



      3. Considering the submissions made by the counsel and

also looking into the annexures produced with the petition also,

the question emerging for consideration is whether criminal

proceedings initiated by the 1st respondent/complainant against

her husband and his close relatives after an agreement was

entered into, as evidenced by Annexure A2, pursuant to a

complaint filed before the police, should be continued before the

court. True, there was no proceeding before the court as such in

relation to the matrimonial cruelty alleged to have been imputed

against the complainant. But still, she had complained before

the police with a complaint and pursuant thereto a settlement

was arrived through the mediation of some well-wishers.

Whatever allegations imputed by her in her previous complaint

before the police, at best, would have constituted only an offence

under Section 498A of the IPC, is not seriously disputed. Even if

she had left out some allegations in the previous complaint and

Crl.M.C.No.2748/2012             5




also some other accused persons as well, once a settlement had

been arrived at and that too deciding to severe the relationship

between the spouses with returning of the valuables belonging

to the wife, that should have given a quietus to all controversies

which existed. The records produced by the petitioners would

show that after settlement under Annexure A2 agreement, she

had initiated proceedings under the Protection of Women from

Domestic Violence Act and also for claiming maintenance for the

child from its father. No doubt, if she is entitled to seek the

reliefs in such proceedings either for herself or on behalf of the

child, she is fully competent to do so. However, with respect to

vexing and harassing her husband and his relatives with a

complaint imputing matrimonial cruelty, to proceed against them

for the offence under Section 498A of the IPC, necessarily, the

previous complaint filed by her before the police and its

cessation on an agreement reached by the parties cannot be

ignored where Annexure A2 agreement is not disputed, but, only

the circumstance that she then was having an advanced

pregnancy, that alone, is canvassed for to impeach the

Crl.M.C.No.2748/2012            6




settlement. In such circumstances, I find continuation of the

criminal proceedings against the petitioners and also the other

accused persons named would amount to an abuse of process of

the court. Criminal proceedings against the petitioners and the

other accused persons, though they are not parties to the

petition, in C.C.No.590 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-I, Palakkad are quashed invoking Section

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.



      Crl.M.C. is disposed of.

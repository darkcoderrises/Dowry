          Dated this the 8th day of June, 2015

                           O R D E R

     Petition filed under Section 438 Cr.P.C.

     2.    Petitioner is alleged to have committed the

offences under Sections 323, 325, 498A and 506 of Indian

Penal Code.

     3.    The prosecution case is that demanding dowry

he used to assault his wife. She sustained fracture of the

nasal bone in the assault.

     4.    Heard.

     5.    The statements of witnesses recorded under

Section 161 Cr.P.C indicate that the petitioner has treated

his wife very cruelly and he used to assault her demanding

dowry. On the date of occurrence he punched her in her

face causing fracture of her nasal bone. Though this is a

family dispute, as the petitioner shows criminal tendencies

I am not inclined to grant him anticipatory bail.

     In the result, this application is dismissed.

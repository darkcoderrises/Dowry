          Dated this the 25th    day of March, 2014

                         O R D E R

     This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in

C.C.No.832/2011      on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Chengannoor to quash the proceedings in

view    of the settlement arrived at between them under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

     2.   It is alleged in the petition      that petitioners are

accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C. 832/2011 pending before the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chengannoor. There

was some      incident happened       in the Municipal Council

Meeting held on 17.1.2011 at 3 p.m. in which respondents 2

and 3 sustained some injuries. So on the basis of the

statement given by the 2nd respondent, Chengannoor police

has registered Annexure A1, first information report as Crime

No.   63/2011 against the petitioners alleging       the offence

under S.324     read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

After investigation Annexure A2 final report has been filed

and that was taken on file as C.C.No. 832/2011 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chengannoor and

the case is now pending before that Court.

Crl. M.C. No. 1698 of 2014
                                   2

         3.        Now the matter  has been settled between the

parties and respondents 2 and 3 have filed Annexure A3 and

A4 affidavits stating that they do not want to proceed with

the case in view of the settlement arrived at between them

due to the intervention of well-wishers and friends. No

purpose will be served by proceeding the case as well in view

of the settlement.           Since the offence alleged is     non-

compoundable in nature, there is no possibility           of filing

compounding application before the court below arises. So

they have no other option except          to approach this Court

seeking the following reliefs:



           "For the above reasons and other valid grounds

           that are to be urged at the time of hearing it is

           most humbly prayed in the interest of justice that

           this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash

           Annexure - A1 and A2 FIR and Final Report in

           Crime No.63/2011        of Chengannoor Police

           Station in Alappuzha District pending on the file

           of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

           Chengannoor by          accepting Annexuire A3

           and A4 affidavits of the respondents 2 and 3".

Crl. M.C. No. 1698 of 2014
                                        3

         4. Respondents 2 and 3 appeared through counsel and

submitted             that the matter has been settled between   the

parties and they do not want to proceed with the prosecution

against the petitioners on account of the settlement and they

have filed Annexure A3 and A4 affidavits stating these facts.

          5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in

view of the settlement,               there is no possibility of any

conviction. So he prayed for allowing the application.

         6. On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor, on

instructions, as directed by this Court, submitted that except

this case, there is no other case against the petitioners and

there is no              criminal background as well for them,   but

opposed the petition.

         7. It is an admitted fact that the incident occurred in a

Municipal Council Meeting in which respondents               2 and 3

sustained some injuries. On the basis of the statement given

by the 2nd respondent, the Chengannoor                  police   has

registered Annexure A1 first information report as Crime No.

63/2011 against the petitioners alleging          the offence  under

Section 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It

is also an admitted fact after investigation Annexure- A2

final       report        was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.

Crl. M.C. No. 1698 of 2014
                                      4

832/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Chengannoor and it is pending before that Court. Now

the matter has been settled between the parties.

         8.      It is true that the elected representatives have to

maintain some dignity            in the meeting hall.     When they

exceed their limit, such incidents are happening now-a-days.

However, now they have forgotten their political enmity and

decided            to settle the issue to bring harmony among the

political parties. That is evident from Annexure A3 and A4

affidavits filed by respondents 2 and 3.

         9. In view of the settlement arrived at between the

parties, even if the case is allowed to continue, there is no

possibility of conviction arises and it will only         amount to

wastage of judicial time.

         10. In the decision reported in Gian Singh V. State of

Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], it is held as follows:

                  "The position that emerges from the above
         discussion can be summarised thus: the power of
         the High Court in quashing in criminal proceeding or
         F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its inherent
         jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
         given to a criminal court for compounding the
         offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent power
         is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but
         it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline
         engrafted in such power viz;(i) to secure the ends
         of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of

Crl. M.C. No. 1698 of 2014
                                          5

         any Court.           In what cases power to quash the
         criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be
         exercised where the offender and victim have
         settled their dispute would depend on the facts and
         circumstances of each case and no category can be
         prescribed.          However, before exercise of such
         power, the High Court must have due regard to the
         nature and gravity of the crime.             Heinous and
         serious offences of mental depravity or offences like
         murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly
         quashed even though the victim or victim's family
         and the offender have settled the dispute.          Such
         offences are not private in nature and have serious
         impact on society.            Similarly, any compromise
         between the victim and offender in relation to the
         offences under special statutes like Prevention of
         Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
         servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
         provide         for   any  basis   for  quashing criminal
         proceedings involving such offences.             But the
         criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-
         dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing
         for the purposes of quashing, particularly the
         offences          arising  from    commercial,  financial,
         mercantile,         civil,    partnership  or  such  like
         transactions         or   the   offences arising  out  of
         matrimony relating to dowry, etc; or the family
         disputes where the wrong is basically private or
         personal in nature and the parties have resolved
         their entire dispute. In this category of case, High
         Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,
         because of the compromise between the offender
         and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
         and bleak and continuation of criminal case would
         put accused to great oppression and prejudice and
         extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
         quashing          the   criminal  case  despite full and
         complete settlement and compromise with the
         victim.          In other words, the High Court must
         consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to
         the interest of justice to continue with the criminal

Crl. M.C. No. 1698 of 2014
                                        6

         proceeding         or   continuation  of   the criminal
         proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process
         of law despite settlement and compromise between
         the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure
         the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal
         case is put to end and if the answer to the above
         question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be
         well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
         proceeding."

         11. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision

and also considering the fact that it was due to some political

animosity that some incident happened inside the meeting

hall of the Municipal Council during the Council Meeting and

they have settled the issues and do not want to proceed with

the case and no purpose will be served by allowing the case

to continue in view of the settlement, this Court feels that it

is a fit case where the power under Section 482 of Criminal

Procedure               Code    has to be     invoked to quash   the

proceedings in order to promote the settlement arrived at

between the                different political parties   due to the

intervention of mediators and well-wishers.

         So the application is allowed and further proceedings in

C.C. 832/2011 (Crime No. 63/2011 of Chengannoor Police

Station) pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Chengannoor as against the petitioners is quashed.

         Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately for further necessary action in

this regard.

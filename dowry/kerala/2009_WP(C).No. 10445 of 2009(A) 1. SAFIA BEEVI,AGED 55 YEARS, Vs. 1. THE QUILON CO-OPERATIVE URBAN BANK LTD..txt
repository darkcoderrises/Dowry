                  WP(C).NO. 10445              OF 2009
                 ............................................
         DATED THIS THE 31st DAY OF MARCH, 2009

                               JUDGMENT

      Notice to respondents 1 and 2 is dispensed with preserving

their right to move for review of this judgment, if aggrieved.

Government     Pleader     takes       notice     for     third and fourth

respondents.

      2. The second petitioner who underwent certain physical

problems as evidenced by Ext.P3 and her husband, the first

petitioner, who also suffered certain situation evidenced by

Exts.P1 and P2, is stated to have availed a loan of Rs.3,00,000/-

in connection with the marriage of their daughter. The parties are

muslims. In the normal course, even the Muslim Law does not

concede to any custom of any amount being paid to the groom

whereas law relating to muslim community contemplate a

provision being made by the groom in favour of the bride. If that

were so and on the face of Dowry Prohibition act and other

attendant statutory provisions, it is unfortunate that an amount

of Rs.3,00,000/- has been spent on a marriage, particularly when

WP(C) 10445/2009                 2

the facts in hand disclose that petitioners do not have the ability

to repay the entire loan.

      3. With the passage of time, accruals have compelled the

bank to initiate action. They have obtained order under Section

14 of SARFAESI Act from the Chief Judicial Magistrate.         The

petitioners show on the strength of Ext.P7 that an amount of

Rs.70,000/- was paid on 30.3.2009, that is yesterday. Taking

that into consideration, it is ordered that if the entire remaining

outstandings is paid off in five equal monthly instalments,

payable on or before 25th of every month, commencing from April

2009, the impugned distress action will be deferred and

thereafter dropped ultimately on satisfaction of the total accruals.

If there is default in repayment of any of the instalments as

aforesaid, the respondents will be at liberty to further proceed

with the impugned action forthwith.        Learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate will also defer the proceedings in the light of what is

stated above. It is further clarified that this judgment will not

WP(C) 10445/2009                3

stand in the way of the creditor bank extending any ameliorative

measure by reducing the possible outstandings, if sought for, by

the petitioners.

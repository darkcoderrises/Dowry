              Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014
           ----------------------------------------
            Dated this the 14th day of August, 2014

                            ORDER



        The above petition is filed under Section 482 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (for short 'Cr.P.C.') at the instance

of the petitioners, who are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C.No.

209 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kannur, which is a case instituted upon the police report in

Crime No. 417/2013 of Mayyil Police Station for the offences

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 506(1), 452

and 427 read with 34 I.P.C with a prayer to call for the

records in CC 209/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-II, Kannur and quash all the proceedings

against the petitioners as the matter is settled out of court.

        2.     The allegation in the above case is that on

26.04.2013 at 6 p.m. when the 1st respondent was

proceeding to the mosque, the 1st petitioner restrained him

Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014        2



on the road due to the enmity on account of the dispute

about the ownership of the house, beaten him on his face

and head, thereafter when the 1st respondent proceeded to

his house, the petitioners 2 and 3 trespassed into their house

and the 2nd petitioner restrained the 1st respondent and the

3rd petitioner beaten him with his hand, seeing this when the

2nd respondent came to the scene and attempted to stop the

petitioners, the 3rd petitioner caught hold of her neck and

beaten her and threatened the 1st respondent that his leg will

be cut and abused him in filthy language and also broken the

glass of the window of their house and now, the case of the

petitioners is that the matter is settled out of court.

          3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as

well as the learned counsel for the first and second

respondents.       I have also heard the learned Public

Prosecutor.

          4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted

that during the pendency of the above case, the matter is

settled amicably between the parties to the dispute which is

the subject matter of the above case.            Therefore, the

continuation of the proceedings in the above case is abuse of

Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014        3



process of law and proceedings.

          5.   The learned counsel for the first and second

respondents, who on the basis of specific instruction received

from     the    respondents,  submitted    that   the   above

respondents, who are the de facto complainants does not

intend to proceed any further against the petitioners and

they have no grievance against them.

          6.     I   have  carefully considered   the   above

submissions of the respective counsel. I have verified the

documents and materials produced along with the above

petition. In the given facts and circumstances of the case

and especially in the light of the settlement arrived between

the parties to the dispute, the learned Public Prosecutor has

also no objection in allowing the above petition.

          7.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved in the case, it can be seen that the offences

involved in the above case are only under Sections 341, 323,

294(b), 506(1), 452 and 427 read with 34 I.P.C. which are

more or less personal in nature and no public interest is

involved. It is pertinent to note that though such offences

are involved, the real parties to the dispute approached this

Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014               4



Court after having amicably settled the matter. From the

submission made by the counsel for the first and second

respondents, it appears to me that the de facto complainants

has no further grievance against the petitioners/accused in

the light of the settlement arrived by them. In this juncture,

it is relevant to note the decision of the Honourable Apex

Court reported in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012(4)

KLT 108(SC)], in which case, the Supreme Court has held as

follows:-

                   "57.  The position that emerges from the
           above discussion can be summarised thus:         the
           power of the High Court in quashing a criminal
           proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its
           inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from
           the    power   given   to   a   criminal  court   for
           compounding the offences under S.320 of the
           Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
           statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in
           accord with the guideline engrafted in such power
           viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to
           prevent abuse of the process of any Court.        In
           what     cases  power    to   quash   the   criminal
           proceeding    or  complaint    or  F.I.R.  may    be
           exercised where the offender and victim have
           settled their dispute would depend on the facts
           and circumstances of each case and no category
           can be prescribed..

It is further held as follows:-

           ".........  But   the    criminal    cases   having
           overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
           stand on different footing for the purposes of
           quashing, particularly the offences arising from
           commercial, financial,mercantile, civil, partnership
           or such like transactions or the offences arising

Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014              5



          out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the
          family disputes where the wrong is basically
          private or personal in nature and the parties have
          resolved their entire dispute. In this category of
          cases,    High   Court     may   quash    criminal
          proceedings if in its view, because of the
          compromise between the offender and victim, the
          possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and
          continuation of criminal case would put accused
          to great oppression and prejudice and extreme
          injustice would be caused to him by not quashing
          the criminal case despite      full and complete
          settlement and compromise with the victim........"

          8. According to me, in the light of the facts and

circumstances involved in the present case and particularly

in view of the settlement arrived in the present case, the

dictum laid in the above decision is applicable in the present

case.    Thus, I am of the view that as the parties to the

dispute settled the issues amicably, it is the duty of this

Court to promote and encourage such settlement, instead of

compelling the parties to go on with the dispute.             It is

pertinent to note that since the matter is settled out of court,

in the event of proceeding with the trial, there would not

have any fruitful prosecution resulting the conviction of the

accused, rather the net result would be sheer waste of

judicial time and abuse of process of the court and

proceedings. Thus, according to me, following the decisions

cited supra, this Criminal M.C. can be allowed granting the

Crl. M.C. No. 4418 of 2014        6



relief as sought for.

          In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed, quashing all

the proceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.

209/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,

Kannur, in Crime No. 417/2013 of Mayyil Police Station.

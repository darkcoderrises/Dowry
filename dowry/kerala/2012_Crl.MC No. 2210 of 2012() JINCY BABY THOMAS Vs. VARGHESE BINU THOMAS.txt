            Crl.M.C.Nos. 2210, 3153 of 2012
            -----------------------------------------
        Dated this the 3rd day of October, 2012

                          O R D E R

           The former of the two petitions is filed by the defacto

complainant and the latter by one among the accused(A2) in a

case pending on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-1,

Chengannur. The above case has arisen on a complaint of the de

facto complainant alleging matrimonial cruelty and harassment

by her husband, in laws and close relatives, demanding dowry.

Investigation of that crime led to indictment of five accused

persons for the offence punishable under Section 498A and r/w

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Cognizance taken of the

offence by the Magistrate, the case numbered as C.C.No.84 of

2012 awaits trial. During the pendency of the above criminal

proceeding, spouses have resolved the matrimonial disputes and

a decree of divorce dissolving that marriage on mutual consent

has been passed by the competent family court, is the

submission of counsel on both sides. De facto complainant has

no further grievance and she does not wish to prosecute the

accused persons, is the submission of her counsel. Copy of the

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2210, 3153 of 2012
                                 2

decree of divorce granted by the family court has also been

produced in Crl.M.C. No. 3153 of 2012. In the light of the

submissions made by the counsel on both sides, and also taking

note of the settlement effected by the spouses, whether

continuation of the criminal proceedings against the accused

persons is called for has to be examined. Since the offence

imputed against the accused persons has          arisen from the

matrimonial dispute of the spouses, it could be stated that it is

personal and not affecting the public at large. The Apex Court in

Gian Singh V. State of Punjab [2012(2)KLT 108(SC)] has

held that in a case of this nature even where the offence as such

is not compoundable under Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure

Code (for short the 'Code) settlement effected by the parties to

the proceedings can be taken due note of and orders for

annulling the proceedings can be issued invoking the inherent

powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Code. In view of

the settlement effected by the spouses even if the prosecution is

continued chances of conviction against the accused persons are

rather remote and at best it may result only in wastage of

Crl.M.C.Nos. 2210, 3153 of 2012
                                 3

precious time of the court. Taking note of that aspect also,

criminal proceedings against the accused persons in C.C. No.84

of 2012 are quashed under Section 482 of the Code.

           Petition is disposed of.

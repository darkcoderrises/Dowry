            ----------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 11th day of April, 2014

                              ORDER

      This petition is filed u/s.482 Cr.P.C. to quash Annexure-

III final report in Crime No.1086/2010 of Pala Police, which

was registered for offence punishable u/s.498A r/w.34 IPC by

invoking the inherent jurisdiction. The petitioners are 2nd and

3rd accused in the above case, which was filed by the 2nd

respondent before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Pala. The petitioners contended that no overt act is alleged

against them by the 2nd respondent in Annexure-I complaint.

Hence, prima facie case is not made against them. The

petitioners are innocents of the allegations and the 1st

petitioner is a spinster sister looking for matrimonial alliance.

She is unnecessary party in this proceedings.            Moreover,

matrimonial disputes are pending before Family Court,

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12             2

Ettumanoor between the parties, O.P.Nos.1137/2010 and

11367/2010 and this petition was filed by suppressing

those material facts.

      2.    The   allegation  of the   2nd  respondent   in

Annexure-I complaint was that her marriage with the 1st

accused was solemnized on 18.4.2010 at St.George

Cathedral Church, Kothamangalam as Christian religious

rites. After the marriage, both of them resided together as

wife and husband in the matrimonial house, while residing

so, the accused demanded more amount and gold as

dowry and illtreated her both physically and mentally.

Hence, the 2nd respondent filed Anneuxre-I complaint in

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala, which was

forwarded to Pala Police for investigation u/s.156(3)

Cr.P.C.     After getting Annexure-I complaint, Pala Police

registered      Annexure-II  FIR    and   proceeded    with

investigation. After completing investigation, Annexure-III

final report has     been filed before Judicial First Class

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12              3

Magistrate Court, Pala. Hence, the petitioners approached

this Court with this petition.

      3.    Inherent jurisdiction u/s.482 Cr.P.C. can be

invoked in the interest of justice or to prevent abuse of the

process of Court.     This inherent jurisdiction has to be

exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only

when such exercise is justified by the test specifically laid

down by the Section itself.      Moreover, while exercising

jurisdiction, the High Court would not conduct an enquiry

whether the evidence in question is reliable or not or

whether on a reasonable apprehension of it accusation

would not be sustained. That is the primary responsibility

of the trial Judge or Magistrate. To prevent abuse of the

process of the Court, High Court in exercise of its inherent

powers u/s.482 could quash the proceedings but there

would be justification for interference only when the

complaint did not disclose any offence or was frivolous

vexatious or oppressive. Apex Court in State of Haryana V.

Bhajanlal, [1992 SCC (Crl) 426] pointed out that:

                 "Where the allegations made in the FIR
           or complaint are so absurd and inherently
           improbable on the basis of which no prudent
           person can ever reach a just conclusion that
           there is sufficient ground for proceeding
           against the accused, the proceedings are liable
           to be quashed".

      4.    The     learned    counsel    appearing      for the

petitioners contended that prima facie case is not made

out against the 3rd accused, who is the 1st petitioner in this

case. In paragraph 6 of the complaint, it is alleged that 2nd

and 3rd accused illtreated her on the very same day of the

marriage itself. In paragraph 14 also, it is alleged that

when anything is purchased for the complainant, the

accused insisted to purchase the same thing to the 1st

petitioner also.     If anything is done against that direction,

the 1st accused became violent and illtreated her. It is

clear from the evidence that the 3rd accused is a spinster.

      5.    In order to attract Section 498A IPC, the defacto

complainant has to allege that the husband or relative of

husband of a woman subjects such woman to cruelty shall

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12                5

be punished u/s.498A.           The explanation says about

'cruelty' that anywilful conduct which is of such a nature as

is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause

grave injury or danger to life, limb or health of the woman.

Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with

a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet

any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security

or is on account of failure by her or any person related to

her to meet such demand. Here, the vague allegations

made in paragraphs 6 and 14 are not sufficient to attract

the prima facie case against the 3rd accused. Therefore, I

am of the opinion that the prima facie case is not made out

against her.      If that be the position, there is no harm for

the prosecution to proceed against the 1st and 2nd accused

in the above case.          The learned counsel relied Apex

Court decision in        Preeti Gupta and another v. State of

Jharkhand and another [2010 (7) SCC 667], in which it is

held as follows: (paras 32 and 33):

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12                      6

        "32. It is a matter of common experience that most of
        these complaints under Section 498A IPC are filed in
        the heat of the moment over trivial issues without
        proper deliberations.       We come across a large
        number of such complaints which are not even bona
        fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same
        time, rapid increase in the number of genuine cases
        to dowry harassment is also a matter of serious
        concern.
        33. The learned members of the Bar have enormous
        social responsibility and obligation to ensure that the
        social fibre of family life is not ruined or demolished.
        They must ensure that exaggerated versions of
        small incidents should not be reflected in the criminal
        complaints.     Majority of the complaints are filed
        either on their advice or with their concurrence. The
        learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble
        profession must maintain its noble traditions and s
        should treat every complaint under Section 498A as
        a basic human problem and msut make serious
        endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an
        amicable resolution of that human problem. They
        must discharge their duties to the best of their
        abilities to ensure that social fibre, peace and
        tranquillity of the society remains intact.         The
        members of the Bar should also ensure that one
        complaint should not lead to multiple cases."



      6.    In this case also, the 3rd accused is a spinster

and no special allegation is made against her. There is a

matrimonial allegation against the husband and the

mother-in-law. There may be heat of moment over trivial

issues between the husband and wife. But, unfortunately,

in such situation filing of complaint against other inmates,

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12               7

such as unmarred sister-in-law, is a bad precedent and the

consequence of such false implication has not properly

visualised by the defacto complainant in this case. If such

allegations are filed against the inmates, that amount to

overwhelming harassment, agony and pain to the

accused and his close relatives. The ultimate object of

justice is to find out truth and punish the guilty and protect

the innocent. To find out the truth is a Herculian task in

majority of these complaints.     Therefore, the tendency of

implicating inmates is also not uncommon in a matrimonial

dispute. Therefore, such situation is to be identified by the

Magistrate, while taking cognizance of offence and issuing

process towards the person involved in such criminal

cases.

      7.    Here, the allegation made against the 3rd

accused is without any basis. Therefore, I am of the view

that the learned Magistrate failed to scrutinize the

allegations towards her. If such a care is made at the

Crl.M.C.No.2218/12                8

initial stage, perhaps, she would not have approached this

Forum with this petition.       Hence, criminal prosecution

against the the 3rd accused in Crime N0.1086/2010 of Pala

Police, which is pending as C.C.No.532/2010 of Judicial

First Class Magistrate Court, Pala, is hereby quashed by

invoking the inherent jurisdiction. The learned Magistrate

shall proceed with the trial of the 1st and 2nd accused in the

above crime, as per law.

            Crl.M.C. is partly allowed.

                -----------------------------------
            Dated this the 27th day of June, 2013

                           O R D E R

     This petition is filed under Section 438 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Petitioners are the accused in Crime

No.460/2013 of Thodupuzha Police Station registered for

the offence punishable under Section 498 A read with

Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

     2. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the defacto complainant,

who is the wife of the 1st petitioner, and treated her with

cruelty, by demanding more dowry.

     3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the CD. Apart

from the usual allegations being set forth in an offence

under Section 498 A IPC, there are no other specific

allegations in this case. Even though, it is alleged that

the second accused push her down and the first accused

slapped her, the wound certificate does not show any

bodily   injury.  Being     a    matrimonial      offence, and

considering the present stage of investigation, I do not

B.A. No. 1947 of 2013
                                 2

think that the custodial interrogation of the petitioners is

required for the continued investigation of this case.

Matters being so, I am satisfied that anticipatory bail can

be granted to the petitioners.

       In the result, this bail application is allowed and the

Investigating Officer or such other police officer who is

conducting the arrest of the petitioners is directed to

enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest

on each of them executing a bond for ` 25,000/-(Rupees

Twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties for

the like sum each to the satisfaction of the officer

conducting arrest, and       subject to the following terms

and conditions.

           (1) The petitioners shall report before the

     Investigating Officer in between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

     on all Thursdays and Mondays, commencing from

     04.07.2013 for a period of three months or till the

     filing of the final report in this case, which ever is

     earlier.

           (2) The petitioners shall not tamper with the

     evidence or influence witnesses.

           (3) The petitioners shall make themselves

B.A. No. 1947 of 2013
                                 3

     available for interrogation as and when required by

     the Investigating Officer.

           (4) The petitioners shall not involve in any

     offence while on bail.

      It is made clear that the violation of any of the

conditions stipulated above will result in the cancellation

of bail.

         Dated this the 6th day of February, 2013

                           O R D E R



     Petitioner is the sole accused in C.C. No.136 of 1994 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Attingal and the appellant

in Crl.Appeal No.193        of 1997 of the Sessions Court,

Thiruvananthapuram. The petitioner was charge sheeted by the

Circle Inspector of Police, Attingal in Crime No.164 of 1992 for

the offence punishable under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal

Code.    After investigation, charge was laid and consequently

C.C.No.136 of 1994 came into existence.

     2.     The prosecution case is that PW1 who is the wife of

the petitioner who was 24 years old at the time of the incident

was being tortured and harassed by the petitioner on a demand

Crl.R.P.No. 1223 of 2002
                               -:2:-

for more dowry. As she could not withstand the harassment,

she decided to kill her two children and to commit suicide. On

10.6.1992 at 7.30 a.m, she put both her children into a well

situated near her house and jumped into the well with a view to

committing suicide. Unfortunately she was rescued; but both

the children drowned.

     3.    PWs.1 to 9 were examined before the trial court and

Exts.P1 to P6 were marked. The trial court found the petitioner

guilty of the offence under Section 498-A of I.P.C., convicted

him thereunder and sentenced him to undergo simple

imprisonment for three years.       The petitioner unsuccessfully

challenged his conviction and sentence before the Sessions

Court, Thiruvananthapuram through Crl.Appeal No.193 of 1997.

     4.    Even in the midst of the limited scope of scanning the

evidence in a case wherein there are concurrent findings of guilt

entered by both the courts below, this Court has perused the

evidence. The main argument forwarded by the learned counsel

for the petitioner is that PW1 was charge sheeted for the

offences under Sections 302 and 309 of I.P.C., and she was

Crl.R.P.No. 1223 of 2002
                                 -:3:-

tried before the Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram in

Sessions Case No. 40 of 1993, and that the defence taken in the

said case was that accidentally both the children of the

petitioner fell in a well and she jumped into the well for rescuing

the children. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,

the said defence taken by PW1 in the said case in which she

could   obtain    an   acquittal  clearly militates  against   the

prosecution case herein. A copy of the judgment passed by the

Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram in Sessions Case No.40 of

1993 has been produced by the learned counsel for the

petitioner. It is true that as pointed out by the learned counsel

for the petitioner, a defence was taken for and on behalf of PW1

in the said case. At the same time, there is absolutely nothing

to show that PW1 had made such a version before the Sessions

Court, Thiruvananthapuram in the said case.         She was not

confronted with any of her such statements in this case. In the

said sessions case she was acquitted by extending the benefit of

doubt.   Such a defence taken by the learned counsel for PW1

(who was the accused in the said case), cannot militate against

Crl.R.P.No. 1223 of 2002
                                -:4:-

the prosecution case herein.

     5.    PW1    has   categorically  deposed   regarding   the

harassments and tortures meted out to her and her deceased

children from the part of the petitioner. She was being tortured

and harassed to the maximum by the petitioner by forwarding a

demand for the execution of a document in respect of the landed

property of the father of PW1 in favour of the petitioner. On the

fateful day also he severely beat PW1 and destroyed the

plantain fruits brought by PW1 for feeding her children.       It

seems, thereafter, the petitioner went away after throwing the

ultimatum that the document relating to the property of the

father of PW1 should be executed in his favour prior to his

coming back.    The girl had no other go than attempting to

commit suicide; but unfortunately she was rescued.

      6.   PW2 is the father of PW1. PW3 is the mother of PW1.

Both PWs.2 and 3 have fully supported the prosecution case and

their testimony clearly corroborate the versions of PW1

regarding the harassments and the circumstances which led to

the incident. PW4 is one of the neighbours of PW1 and he is a

                                  -:5:-

teacher of the Government Boys High School, Attingal.

According to him, there were frequent quarrels between the

petitioner and PW1 and that it was such a quarrel which resulted

in the incident. PW6 is another neighbour who clearly deposed

that there were frequent quarrels in between the petitioner and

PW1 and that the petitioner frequently used to harass and

torture PW1. On a perusal of the evidence in this case, I do not

find any illegality, irregularity, or impropriety in the conviction

passed by the trial Court which was upheld by the appellate

Court.

      7.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has sought for

leniency in the sentence and has pointed out that the trial Court

has imposed the maximum sentence for the offence under

Section 498-A of IPC on the petitioner. This is a case wherein,

in fact, the police ought to have charge sheeted the petitioner

for an offence under Section 306 IPC. The petitioner has, in

fact, marginally escaped from the clutches of S.304B as PW1

could be rescued by the neighbours. Considering the totality of

the circumstances involved and the gravity of the offence

                                 -:6:-

proved, I do not find that the petitioner is entitled to any

leniency in the sentence. This revision is devoid of merits and is

only to be dismissed, and I am doing so.

     In the result, this Crl.R.P. is dismissed.

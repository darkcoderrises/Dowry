                               K.HARILAL, J.
                         ................................
                     Crl.M.C.No. 2286 of 2015
                     ........................................
              Dated this the 18th day of June, 2015

                                   ORDER

  The petitioner Nos.2 to 4 are the accused in Crime No.649 of

  2013 of Alakkode Police Station, which is now pending as

  C.C.No.1306 of 2014 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate

  Court-I, Thaliparamba.



2.The above crime was registered on the basis of a complaint

  filed by the 1st petitioner alleging the offence punishable

  under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.                   The 1st

  petitioner herein is the de facto complainant.



3.In this petition, it is stated that, entire disputes are amicably

  settled between the parties and now the de facto

  complainant is not interested to prosecute petitioner Nos.2 to

  4. Now the de facto complainant has no subsisting grievance

  at all.  The de facto complainant has signed an affidavit

  affirming the said fact and also the settlement arrived at

  between the parties.



4.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

  Public Prosecutor for the respondent.

                                     2


5.I have meticulously considered the decision laid down in Gian

   Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)]. In the

   above case, three Judge Bench of the Apex Court, on a

   reference, considered the question whether the High Court

   has power to quash criminal proceedings involving non-

   compoundable offences on the basis of the compromise

   reached between the offender and the victim and answered

   as given below:

            "57.    The position that emerges from the above

            discussion can be summarised thus: the power

            of the High Court in quashing a criminal

            proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise of its

            inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from

            the    power  given    to  a   criminal   court   for

            compounding the offences under S.320 of the

            Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with

            no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised

            in accord with the guideline engrafted in such

            power viz;(1) to secure the ends of justice or (ii)

            to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In

            what     cases power     to   quash   the   criminal

            proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be

            exercised where the offender and victim have

            settled their dispute would depend on the facts

            and circumstances of each case and no category

            can be prescribed. However, before exercise of

            such power, the High Court must have due

            regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.

Crl.M.C.No. 2286 of 2015
                                     3


            Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity

            or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,

            cannot be fittingly quashed even though the

            victim or victim's family and the offender have

            settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

            in nature and have serious impact on society.

            Similarly, any compromise between the victim

            and offender in relation to the offences under

            special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act

            or the offences committed by public servants

            while working in that capacity etc; cannot

            provide for any basis for quashing criminal

            proceedings involving such offences.      But the

            criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-

            dominatingly civil flavour stand on different

            footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly

            the offences arising from commercial, financial,

            mercantile,   civil, partnership   or  such   like

            transactions or the offences arising out of

            matrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the family

            disputes where the wrong is basically private or

            personal in nature and the parties have resolved

            their entire dispute. In this category of cases,

            High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in

            its view, because of the compromise between the

            offender and victim, the possibility of conviction

            is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal

            case would put accused to great oppression and

            prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused

            to him by not quashing the criminal case despite

            full and complete settlement and compromise

Crl.M.C.No. 2286 of 2015
                                     4


            with the victim. In other words, the High Court

            must consider whether it would be unfair or

            contrary to the interest of justice to continue with

            the criminal proceeding or continuation of the

            criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse

            of process of law despite settlement and

            compromise between the victim and wrongdoer

            and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is

            appropriate that criminal case is put to an end

            and if the answer to the above question(s) is in

            affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its

            jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."



6.In view of the proposition laid down above, the question to

   be considered, in the instant case, is, whether the non-

   compoundable offence involved in this case can be

   compounded, in the exercise of the inherent power under

   Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I

   find that the offences alleged against the petitioner will not

   come under the category of non-compoundable offences,

   which are specifically excluded from composition, in the

   exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C.

   Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is

   seen that the dispute between the accused and the victim

   had been amicably settled and, at present, the de facto

   complainant has no subsisting grievance at all. The de facto

Crl.M.C.No. 2286 of 2015
                                   5


   complainant does not want to proceed with prosecution

   against the accused.          Full and final settlement and

   compromise with the victim are evidenced by Annexure-III.

   In view of the compromise between the petitioner and the

   victim, I find that the possibility of conviction is remote, bleak

   and continuation of the criminal case would, put the parties

   to great oppression, prejudice and also tantamount to abuse

   of the process of the court. The present criminal prosecution

   against the accused must be put to an end to secure the

   interest of justice.



7.In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings against the

   petitioner under Annexure-I final report will stand quashed.



   This petition is disposed of as above.

SUBASH CHANDRA MISHRA Petitioner       
THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA AND ANR. Respodents        
PENAL CODE, 1860    
 INDIAN  PENAL  CODE, 1860 - Secs.498-A and 506 r/w Sec.4  of   
 Dowry  Prohibition  Act  -  Charges under  -  Since  offence
 committed u/s.498-A, IPC and husband and wife wanted to live
 as  married  couple,  it  would be travesty  of  justice  if
 criminal  proceeding  is allowed to continue merely  because
 Sec.498-A,  IPC is not compoundable - In this present  case,
 when both husband and wife want to put an end to the marital
 ties  and do not want to proceed further with criminal case,
 and  want  to  end the Divorce case, it would be  proper  to
 allow the prayer.

         Result - Crl. Misc.Case &amp; Crl.Rvn. disposed of.
